<p style="margin-bottom:1em;font-size:115%;"><i>The first ever Mickey Mouse (Steamboat Willie) horror film hit&#8217;s the virtual shelves today across North America on all TVOD/Digital platforms “The Mouse Trap.”</i></p>
<p>LOS ANGELES, CA, USA, August 6, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; The first ever Mickey Mouse (Steamboat Willie) horror film hit&#8217;s the virtual shelves today across North America on all TVOD/Digital platforms “<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30743549/reference/?ref_=tt_mv_close" data-wpel-link="external">The Mouse Trap</a>.” This wickedly clever horror film is the creation of Into Frame Productions partners as well as director &#8211; <a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8235871/" data-wpel-link="external">Jamie Bailey</a> and star &#8211; <a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1792652/?ref_=tt_rv_t0" data-wpel-link="external">Simon Phillips</a> (Netflix’s “FUBAR” with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lionsgate’s “Survive the Game” with Bruce Willis, Amazon Prime hit TV Shows “Age of The Living Dead” &amp; “No Easy Days,” “Blood and Snow,” and the wickedly brilliant dark comedy “Stealing Chaplin”).  </p>
<p>The film garnered huge press attention when their teaser trailer dropped on January 1st, 2024, on Simon Phillips’ personal YouTube account and has since been seen by millions of people worldwide. Produced by Mark Popejoy, Alexander Gausman and Andrew Agopsowicz and the Co Producer is Filmcore&#8217;s Mem Ferda, the film is being released by Gravitas Ventures, An Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment Company, for the United States and Canada. The Horror feature, “The Mouse Trap” is available now in North America (USA &amp; Canada) on all TVOD/digital platforms and will be available on DVD/Blu-Ray on August 13th, 2024.  </p>
<p>*Steamboat Willie is the earliest version of Disney’s Mickey Mouse character, which entered the public domain on Jan. 1, 2024.*</p>
<p>The film&#8217;s Director Jamie Bailey states &#8220;The Mouse Trap film is famously the first horror film to use the Mickey Mouse character from Steamboat Willie. We just wanted to have fun with it all. I mean it&#8217;s Steamboat Willie&#8217;s Mickey Mouse murdering people. It&#8217;s ridiculous. We ran with it and had fun doing it and I think it shows.&#8221; </p>
<p>The film stars Simon Phillips (THE WITCHER, FUBAR) as the titular villain, said of the film &#8220;We have a childlike excitement to show the world the film! We love the amazing work Walt Disney created here and we love the creative freedom the character coming into public domain provided. Fun. That&#8217;s what we had making it and what you will get watching it.&#8221; </p>

<p>NEW YORK , NY , USA, August 5, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; <a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0990600/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk" data-wpel-link="external">Robert Gillings</a>, the visionary creator of the hit TV series &#8220;Paper Empire,&#8221; and the first American director to film a Hollywood T.V. show in ALULa, Saudi Arabia;  has weighed in on the recent dramatic Bitcoin crash that has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market. With a storied career in the entertainment industry and an astute understanding of financial markets, Gillings offers a unique perspective on the volatility of digital currencies.</p>
<p>In his latest statement, Gillings commented on the inherent risks and market sentiment driving Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bitcoin &#8211; Risk-On, Risk-Off! Bitcoin, the leaderless leader leading the tumbling price in cryptocurrencies today. Seems when the sentiment moves towards protecting capital by reducing exposure to risk, both traders and investors are quick to dump their Bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gillings&#8217; insights come at a time when Bitcoin has experienced a significant decline, shedding over 20% of its value in the past month alone. The cryptocurrency, which had seen a meteoric rise over the past few years, is now facing increased scrutiny from investors concerned about its stability and long-term viability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paper Empire,&#8221; Gillings&#8217;  TV series soon to hit screens, delves into the world of high finance, cryptocurrency, and the dark underbelly of the global economy. The show has captivated audiences with its gripping portrayal of financial intrigue and the complex characters navigating this volatile landscape. Gillings&#8217; profound understanding of financial dynamics, as evidenced in &#8220;Paper Empire,&#8221; lends credibility to his analysis of the current Bitcoin market situation.</p>
<p>Gillings has always been a forward-thinker, integrating real-world financial trends and issues into the narrative of &#8220;Paper Empire.&#8221; His latest commentary on Bitcoin not only reflects the themes explored in his show but also provides valuable insights for those invested in or curious about the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>As Bitcoin continues to fluctuate, industry experts and investors alike will undoubtedly look to thought leaders like Robert Gillings for guidance and perspective. His ability to blend storytelling with financial acumen sets him apart, making his opinions highly sought after in both the entertainment and financial sectors.</p>

<p>BIRMINGHAM, UK, August 5, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; TFNation 2024, will take place this weekend,  August 9th to the 11th at the Hilton Birmingham Metropole, in Birmingham, UK. TFNation is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the world’s favorite transforming robots. This year, the convention, on course to be Europe’s largest ever Transformers fan convention, is set to feature the only voice star to be inducted into the Transformer’s Hall of Fame for his portrayal of both Optimus Prime AND Megatron, Mr. David Kaye.</p>
<p>Kaye, renowned for his deep, commanding voice brought the character to life, making Megatron one of the most memorable villains in animation history. Kaye continued his evil streak in the Unicron Trilogy series, voicing Megatron and Galvatron in Armada, Energon, and Cybertron.</p>
<p>In 2007, Kaye demonstrated his versatility by switching sides and voicing the heroic Autobot leader, Optimus Prime, in the fan-favorite series Transformers: Animated. His ability to embody both the franchise&#8217;s most formidable villain and its noble hero speaks to his exceptional range as a voice actor.</p>
<p>Kaye&#8217;s contributions to the Transformers universe didn’t stop there. He has also voiced characters like Lugnut, Grimlock, and Warpath in Transformers: Animated, Hardshell in Transformers: Prime, and Hammerstrike and Slashmark in Robots in Disguise. No matter when you became a Transformers fan, chances are you&#8217;ve heard David Kaye&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>Beyond the world of Transformers, Kaye has an extraordinary resume that includes Marvel’s Eternals as Arishem, Andy Samberg’s new TV series Digman as Howard Toe, Sesshomaru in Inuyasha and YashaHime, Trieze  Khushrenada in Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, Grandpa Max in Ben 10, Battle Cat/Cringer in Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&#8221;, Multiple guest stars in Teen Titans Go! As well as Vandal Savage in DC Super Friends, Young Justice,  X-Men: Evolution as Professor X, and one of the world’s most adored tiny robots Clank in Sony/ Insomniac Games’ renowned “Ratchet &amp; Clank” franchise. David is also widely recognized as the voice narrator for HBO’s Emmy-winning Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. </p>

<p>— Wendy Levy, Executive Director of the Alliance</p>
</div>
<p>NEW YORK, NY, USA, August 5, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; The Hip-Hop Education Center (HHEC) is proud to announce its selection as one of the recipients of the Society of American Archivists Foundation Catalyst Grant. This prestigious grant will enable HHEC to hire an archivist to work on the Fresh Bold So Def (FBSD) Women in Hip-Hop Collection, making it accessible to the public in 2025. The FBSD Collection includes ephemera, books, films, toys, apparel, and more.</p>
<p>HHEC has also been invited as a partner in the Alliance for Media Arts + Culture&#8217;s Digital Archivist Apprenticeship program. This groundbreaking initiative addresses the growing demand for skilled digital archivists and is part of a broader effort to build a sustainable support ecosystem for creative careers and entrepreneurship. HHEC will provide support to the Alliance designing work-based curricula, testing new digital archive models and developing strategies for supporting the training of community-based archivists.</p>
<p>The apprenticeship program aims to equip emerging digital workers with the necessary skills to navigate, preserve, manage, and curate vast amounts of digital content. By establishing this Registered Apprenticeship Program (RAP), the Alliance seeks to fill the current skills gap in this high-demand field and provide meaningful opportunities for economically disadvantaged youth. The initiative is funded by a grant from the California Opportunity Youth Apprenticeship (COYA) program, part of a larger $31 million state investment in pre-apprenticeships and apprenticeships across various sectors, including media arts and creative technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our partnership with Hip-Hop Education Center illuminates the pathway for developing a program that is fully community-centered, reflecting the needs of next generation creators and culture bearers who will be  organizing and curating from archives in wholly new ways,&#8221; says Wendy Levy, Executive Director of the Alliance. &#8220;Thanks to HHEC and the vision of Martha Diaz, our California-funded initiative can now serve as a youth-driven model for organizations and institutions across the country.&#8221; </p>
<p>Moreover, Martha Diaz, Executive Director of HHEC, serves as one of the project leads for the <a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://arts2work.media" data-wpel-link="external">Arts2Work</a> Digital Archivist Apprenticeship program. She will help develop the curriculum, form a youth advisory committee and mentoring board, and work closely with partners to assess archival needs. Earlier this year, Diaz was elected to serve a three-year term as Member-at-Large for the Independent Archivist Steering Committee at the Society of American Archivists (SAA). The Committee&#8217;s mission is to provide advocacy and agency for independent archivists, those serving in an archival capacity beyond the traditional boundaries of institutional galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) archives. </p>
<p>The Committee aims to:<br />&#8211; Foster awareness of professionals pushing beyond traditional roles.<br />&#8211; Build a community for those on the fringes of more traditional SAA sections.<br />&#8211; Provide tools and resources to advocate for archival work in non-traditional settings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m extremely honored to be part of this committee and look forward to contributing to the evolution of the field and offering new perspectives and career pathways into the archiving profession,&#8221; said Martha Diaz.</p>
<p>Furthermore, HHEC, in partnership with Maysles Documentary Center, has become a community partner and host site for Bay Area Video Coalition (<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bavc.org/programs/preservation/" data-wpel-link="external">BAVC</a>) Media. Through this collaboration, they will offer Community-Based Preservation Education and Training: Hands-on Training in Analog Video Playback Equipment, a six-module training course intended to strengthen the skills of professionals who work with analog media as well as those who have no previous experience.</p>
<p>This is all in preparation for a comprehensive Community Archiving initiative that will be launched in 2025 in celebration of HHEC’s 15th anniversary. The initiative will be a call for artifacts and testimonials on the impact of Hip-Hop, inviting community members to contribute their personal stories, memorabilia, and reflections on how Hip-Hop has influenced their lives and communities. This initiative aims to create a rich, inclusive archive that captures the cultural and historical significance of Hip-Hop through diverse voices and perspectives.</p>

Through this unlikely friendship and confronting both internal and external antagonistic forces, JB embarks on a journey of self-discovery and healing. In the end, he finds the inspiration to finish his novel and moves forward with a newfound sense of purpose</p>
<p>“It’s a very personal story for me,” says Mallon. “I’ve had my struggles with mental health, which can unfortunately weigh not just on oneself but also on significant others.” The idea for RUN was pitched to Timothy as a short film just before the Covid-19 pandemic. “I wrote the short in a matter of hours; it flowed out of me organically.” But it wasn’t until 18 months later that the unproduced short was turned into a feature. “I completed the first draft of the feature in about four days. It was a very raw experience, but that&#8217;s where the gold is.”</p>
<p>The response to RUN has been enthusiastic from both film festivals and business executives. The film is slated for its first public showing at the St. Louis International Film Festival in November. Before that, it will have several private screenings, including its debut at a London press and industry screening on October 10th, hosted by PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited (PwC), one of the Big Four accounting firms. On October 30th, <a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://wbd.com/dei/" data-wpel-link="external">WarnerBros BOLD</a> (Black Outstanding Leaders Delivering) will hold an internal screening at WarnerBros Studio Leavesden as part of their DEI outreach. The final UK screening, sponsored by the British international law firm Mishcon de Reya LLP, is to take place on November 1st.</p>
<p>Timothy is hard at work on his next project, which he describes as a “Relationship-horror” feature. He also has other films and television pilots in circulation. Horror and thrillers are excellent vehicles for channeling my angst, and I love to push the envelope while keeping everything grounded”, he says.</p>
<p>About Timothy</p>
<p>Timothy Mallon was born and raised in the picturesque town of Dorchester, nestled on the breathtaking Jurassic Coast. Surrounded by open farmers’ fields and the nearby sea, young Timothy’s world was one of natural beauty and boundless imagination. One of his earliest memories is watching “Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade” on VHS, a moment that ignited his dream of becoming a storyteller.</p>
<p>Growing up in a lower-middle-class, rural community meant that Timothy’s options were limited, but his passion for acting and storytelling flourished. At school, he often penned short stories on scrap paper, inspired by the magic of Spielberg and Lucas. His days were filled with adventures, running through fields, building dens in the woods, and imagining himself as a pirate, Indiana Jones, or a Jedi long before he turned ten, was drawn to painting, writing, and acting. In secondary school, Timothy’s love for writing and acting deepened. After completing Sixth Form, he went on to study at Southampton Solent University, where he earned a BA in Performance. These years were transformative, allowing him to refine his writing skills and gain invaluable experience in film and television.</p>
<p>While acting remained a cherished pursuit, writing became Timothy’s primary focus. His journey led him across the Atlantic, and he now resides in the vibrant city of Los Angeles, where he continues to craft stories that resonate with authenticity and heart.</p>
<p>“RUN” is directed by Bernard Kordieh, and produced by Rashomon Films, and stars CJ Beckford, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, and Leon Herbert.<br />&#13;<br />

<p>— Matt Barnes</p>
</div>
<p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, August 5, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; Former NBA star Matt Barnes has penned a short essay, &#8220;My Black Mark,&#8221; recounting how an episode involving the KKK in high school impacted his understanding of his identity &#8211; a topic his film Black Mark, set to debut at the HollyShorts Film Festival August 10th. </p>
<p>An excerpt from his essay reads: </p>
<p>&#8220;Blackness is, once again, front page news, and trending on social media nationwide. By now, you have heard that while speaking at the National Association of Black Journalists conference in Chicago last week, the question of Vice President Kamala Harris’s Blackness was brought into question: “Is she Black? Is she Indian? What is she, really?” asked former President Donald Trump, asserting that being Black conferred some sort of social advantage.  </p>
<p>We all know that the questions are to be expected; politicians in this country have been using race to discredit their opponents for decades, while the social construct of race is more fluid than ever from social science to coffee shop debates, with real life consequences. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s leave it to the special interests to push their agendas. The incident, however, did remind me of the tension navigating my own dueling identities, and how I set out to tell my story.  </p>
<p>On Saturday, August 10th, my documentary BLACK MARK debuts at the <a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://hollyshorts2024.eventive.org/films/66ad30302215970072671e70" data-wpel-link="external">HollyShorts Film Festival in Los Angeles</a>. I am proud of this film and invite you to attend the premiere.  </p>
<p>The film recalls how a hate crime I experienced as a senior in high school forever changed my life. More specifically, it recounts how an incident involving my sister led to me getting into a fight to protect her, which led to a suspension, which led to the local KKK breaking into my school to tag it in hateful graffiti, hanging a mannequin with my jersey from an oak tree in effigy, and attempting to burn the classrooms to the ground in an overnight invasion. </p>
<p>The next day, I learned from my white supremacist first cousin (yes, you read that right), that the KKK had put a hit on my head, and they were planning to kill me. Around-the-clock security was deployed, buying my family just enough time to pick up and move.  </p>
<p>I call this episode my Black Mark – a definitive, life changing moment in my life that was so profound that my existence on this earth was never the same again. My Black Mark is, at once, scar tissue of my racial trauma, but also my emblem of hope and survival that I leaned on through episodes like the Donald Sterling disaster while with the Clippers, and my social justice advocacy throughout my life.  </p>
<p>Up until those fateful few days in 1998, I had struggled to understand my mixed race, Italian-Black identity. I was stuck in-between &#8211; never white enough for the Italian side of the family, never black enough to feel belonging on the other side because I was not “fully Black.”  </p>
<p>The incident, however, changed everything: from that moment on, I was a Black man.&#8221; </p>
<p>It been just over 25 years since Matt Barnes&#8217; Black Mark awakening. Anniversaries – whether celebrated or maligned – &#8220;are an opportunity to look back and ahead, and was the intent of the BLACK MARK film,&#8221; notes Barnes. Reflecting on the importance of the film, he concludes, &#8220;I know that I am no different than countless Black people across our country fighting to understand their own dueling identities (the average African American has a quarter European ancestry, for example), and who are victims of racism just like me. In turn, my hope for the film is that it will encourage viewers to use their very own Black Marks as way to tell their stories, on their own terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>— Jamie Branson</p>
</div>
<p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, August 6, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; <br />
In the rapidly evolving world of Free Ad-Supported Streaming Television (FAST), <a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://kapang.com" data-wpel-link="external">Kapang</a> is making waves by offering a comprehensive, integrated platform that promises to reshape the landscape of content monetization. By providing a fully integrated &#8220;walled garden eco-system&#8221; approach, Kapang integrates all necessary technologies to deliver a seamless experience akin to YouTube and Twitch, but with a focus on both broadcast linear and premium on-demand content.</p>
<p>What is FAST and what have been the pain points?</p>
<p>Free Ad-Supported Streaming Television (FAST) channels are a type of streaming service that offers viewers access to a variety of content without requiring a subscription fee. Instead, these channels generate revenue through advertisements, similar to traditional broadcast television. <a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://viewtvx.com/fast-channels/" data-wpel-link="external">FAST channels</a> provide a linear viewing experience, where content is scheduled and streamed in real-time, much like traditional TV channels. This model is often paired to Ad-Supported Video on Demand (AVOD), where viewers can choose what to watch from a library of content, but still encounter ads during their viewing experience. Both FAST and AVOD offer cost-effective ways for viewers to access content while providing monetization opportunities for content providers through ad revenue.</p>
<p>A Single Cost Solution with Higher Revenue Returns with Kapang.</p>
<p>One of the standout features of Kapang&#8217;s platform is its single-cost model, which significantly benefits channel operators. Unlike the traditional multi-supplier ecosystem, which often returns less than 15% of gross revenues to channel operators, Kapang ensures that at least two-thirds of gross revenues go back to the channel operators and content studios. This model is particularly advantageous for operators with premium content, live news, or those transitioning from satellite and cable platforms, making it one of the only viable and attractive options.</p>
<p>Meeting Audience Expectations with Quality Content is where Kapang sees major growth.</p>
<p>Kapang&#8217;s research identified a clear audience preference for traditional format high-quality television over archived content playlists. Recognizing this, Kapang developed a solution that not only offers higher revenue returns than traditional FAST services but also provides more value than YouTube. Traditional FAST services, often based on platforms like Amagi, Ottera and Wurl, offer a fraction of the revenue potential that even YouTube provides due to the multiple parties and high fixed technology fees all taking a giant slice of the revenues.</p>
<p>Cost-Efficient Premium Content Creation is what FAST needs for market share.</p>
<p>Kapang has reverse-engineered the costs associated with creating premium content and broadcast-grade TV channels. This approach ensures that the business model is sustainable and meets the high expectations of modern audiences. By doing so, Kapang delivers a service that aligns with the quality and reliability viewers expect from traditional television.</p>
<p>No need to change existing workflows and origin service or playout providers, Kapang provides the end-to-end carriage and monetization for broadcasters and content providers of all sizes from niche genre channel brands to national news broadcasters and live sports networks.</p>
<p>Addressing Advertiser Concerns have motivated the Kapang solution.</p>
<p>Through extensive research, Kapang found that advertisers were unhappy with the transparency issues in programmatic trading on current FAST platforms. This dissatisfaction stems from the multiple transitions between different software and the inconsistencies in syntax accuracy across the network.  To address this, Kapang offers an integrated platform that promises greater transparency and higher confidence which provides higher advertising yield . This approach not only benefits advertisers but also enhances the overall revenue potential for channel operators.</p>
<p>The Kapang Independent broadcaster approach delivers an amazing audience experience.</p>
<p>Kapang is focused on enabling third-party broadcasters to deliver and monetize their FAST television channels, rather than following the predominantly owned and operated (O&amp;O) models of platforms like Pluto TV and Samsung Plus, where all content deals and linear channels are curated in-house. Kapang believes that independent broadcasters possess a deep understanding of the content and curation required for their specific audiences, whether it be niche sports channels, music television, or the numerous local television channels that serve their communities with trusted brands. By acting as an enabler for these focused broadcast experts, Kapang acknowledges that it is impossible to satisfy every audience group under one roof.

<p>— Filmmaker Jeremy Simmons</p>
</div>
<p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, August 6, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; Freestyle Digital Media, the digital film distribution division of Byron Allen’s Allen Media Group, has just released the rock music documentary 500 DAYS OF SILENCE, which is now available to rent/own on all North American digital HD internet, cable, and satellite platforms, as well as on DVD, starting on August 6, 2024.</p>
<p>The documentary 500 DAYS OF SILENCE provides first-hand accounts and relays the experiences of rock bands and musicians who faced uncertainty during the global pandemic – that time in recent history when the entertainment industry shut down with no end in sight. Rock bands playing small clubs and large stadiums all struggled during an unprecedented time in history. Tours were canceled and venues closed as bands were told to pack up and go home. Meanwhile, breakout rockers The Black Moods, from Tempe, Arizona, hit the Billboard Top 20 charts, but now what? The band is determined to keep going; discovering new ways of connecting with fans and figuring out what is really important in their lives. Viewers will experience honest conversations about the personal challenges of veteran rockers Sammy Hagar, Michael Anthony, Rick Springfield, members of the Gin Blossoms, REO Speedwagon, Slipknot, and Steel Panther as these artists contend with their livelihood being silenced, not knowing if they will play on a live stage again, as they discover how to keep the music going. 500 DAYS OF SILENCE was filmed on location over two years during the pandemic with The Black Moods as they navigate the highs and lows of keeping the rock and roll engine going in Arizona, Mexico, Missouri, South Dakota, Florida, and Southern California. It’s a story of perseverance, personal challenges, and inspiration as musicians struggle to play on and reconnect with their fans.  </p>
<p>Written and directed by Jeremy Simmons, “500 DAYS OF SILENCE featured artists and notables include Sammy Hagar and Michael Anthony (Van Halen), Corey Taylor (Slipknot), Rick Springfield, Kevin Cronin (REO Speedwagon), Robin Wilson (Gin Blossoms),  Eddie Trunk, Eddie Kramer, Josh Kennedy, Chico Diaz, Jordan Hoffman (The Black Moods), Jim Adkins (Jimmy Eat World), Michael Starr (Steel Panther), Vic Johnson (The Circle), and, Roger Clyne (Refreshments).</p>
<p>“When the music stopped, I wanted to tell the story of our shuttered local music scene in Tempe, Arizona,” said filmmaker Jeremy Simmons. “I wanted to convey the feeling of losing one’s livelihood, coupled with the uncertainty and fears of musicians, no matter how far along they were in their careers. The story of 500 DAYS OF SILENCE unfolds through the journey where the bands &#8211; The Black Moods and Sammy Hagar – who finally take the stage again for the first time… on the same weekend!”</p>
<p>Freestyle Digital Media negotiated the deal to acquire 500 DAYS OF SILENCE through Alex Nohe at Blood Sweat Honey</p>
