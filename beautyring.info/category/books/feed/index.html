<p>BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, August 7, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; <a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.haute-lifestyle.com/" data-wpel-link="external">Haute-Lifestyle.com</a>, the online boutique luxury lifestyle magazine, helmed by Publisher and award-winning screenwriter <a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://authory.com/JanetWalker" data-wpel-link="external">Janet Walker</a>, has reached another milestone in its journey recently celebrating 15 years in operation and surpassing 7,000 pieces of content as the digital continues to distinguish itself among the world of online publications.</p>
<p>The internationally known and recognized digital magazine began as a one-page idea during the 2009 global financial meltdown and was nurtured by Ms. Walker’s unwavering belief that if you build it, the audience will be there. It wasn’t quite that simple, but that single idea coupled with Ms. Walker’s commitment to deliver engaging and interesting content has helped the magazine continue to grow and develop.</p>
<p>Haute-Lifestyle.com, &#8220;The Huff Post of Luxury,&#8221; has provided readers with breaking news, political coverage, and current entertainment reviews for 15 years and remains committed to supplying readers with information across various contemporary topics.</p>
<p>A weekly roundup of the nation&#8217;s top stories from inside the Beltway, the Beltway Insider provides readers with information on how political events around the world affect citizens, from the continuing Coronavirus flareups to inflation, presidential politics, and which stories are gaining momentum in Washington, and which are buried.</p>
<p>Ms. Walker, the sole owner of Haute-Lifestyle.com, is also a recognized and seasoned journalist and provides content across many topics. Other contributors supply content from Europe and offer insight into hot spots around the European continent, medical science updates, and home and décor ideas.</p>
<p>Across the nine sections and 43 subsections, Haute-Lifestyle.com also brings readers an international cosmopolitan beat with coverage in crime, science, technology, lifestyle, fashion, entertainment, travel, leisure, arts, book reviews, theater, music, and the world&#8217;s geopolitical scene.</p>

<p>The recent recognition of each of Ms. Walker&#8217;s five screenplays, &#8220;The Six Sides of Truth,&#8221; &#8220;The Wednesday Killer,&#8221; &#8220;The Manhattan Project,&#8221; &#8220;The Assassins of Fifth Avenue,&#8221; and “Project 13: The Last Day,” elevates the total awards and selections to 112.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Six Sides of Truth,&#8221; tells the story of a female reporter who discovered the human testing of a classified project and her race against time to expose the high-ranking government officials who will stop at nothing to silence her.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Wednesday Killer,&#8221; a riveting, race against time crime drama, tells the story of a sadomasochistic murderer targeting affluent New York City women and the FBI agent driven by childhood memories to catch this monster before he kills again.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Manhattan Project,&#8221; a riveting, fast-action, suspense thriller, weaves a tale of greed and corruption, as a dedicated investigative news team works to expose a depraved minister and a tenacious DEA agent, haunted by the murder of her family, race to capture a ruthless cartel leader with a foothold in Manhattan&#8217;s legal system.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Assassins of Fifth Avenue,&#8221; an edgy crime thriller, tells the story of a wealthy criminal mastermind, a serial killer, and a reporter determined to uncover the truth and the exiled detective she enlists to help her find the killer before he kills again.</p>
<p>“Project 13: The Last Day,” a gripping, white-knuckle, sci-fi action drama, follows the Braverman family in a post-apocalyptic world as they seek to reunite with their loved ones after a bioweapon is released resulting in anarchy and lawlessness while the government searches for a solution.</p>

<p>PRATTVILLE, ALABAMA, USA, August 7, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; G.B. Ryder weaves a profound book that dabbles with the clichéd theme of romance with a never-seen-before spin, a signature of Ryder’s own literary turn of phrase. The book explores the emotional expedition through the lens of the protagonist, Scott Ransom, who is trying to make meaning out of emotions as he juggles multiple relationships and looks for solace in adventures on his motorcycle.</p>
<p>The book, through Scott’s journey, showcases a realistic and emotional transformation, giving insights into how the mind and heart evolve and how emotional turmoil can affect an individual. Ryder paints an intense and vivid picture of the mental discourse that stirs up in a young man’s mind when faced with emotional challenges. As readers course through the pages, they will unravel how one can manage sentiment and regulate the actions and reactions that can impact interactions irreversibly. From romantic engagements to familial bonds, the literature can immerse young readers of drama and adventure into a voyage bubbling with effervescent and warm emotions that are seldom talked about.</p>
<p>Staged in the Blue Ridge Mountains, Walk Away mortalizes the rugged terrain, immersing and inviting readers into a landscape that can likely pique their wanderlust. Also, the writing has achieved the brilliant feat of giving a whole personality to the settings. The mountains and the adventurous landscape of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the surrounding areas have a tangible effect induced in Scott’s personality, which fortifies his characters as an adventurous spirit many readers might find a liking to. </p>
<p>Ryder has carefully cherry-picked the era for Walk Away, staging it in the 70s, and made use of the era’s social norms and cultural practices to discuss how the surroundings and society can impact the deepest, most private layers of an individual’s life.</p>
<p>Upon a deeper inspection of Walk Away, readers will be treated to subliminal symbolism that Ryder has carefully imbued in the story, which unravels as readers build relatability to the character, making the story a much more profound read than it might initially seem to be. Ryder has cautiously and smartly used simple elements like the protagonist’s motorcycle to express the most inward desires prodding on themes like one desire for freedom and escape and the challenges around it.</p>
<p>G.B. Ryder loves to investigate and explore the depths of raw and intense human emotions. He infuses the essence of real-life heroes and people he comes across in his characters, weaving stories that offer a tangibility of sentiments through his narrations. He adds a literary piquancy into his stories using descriptive and imaginative details of authentic locations, instilling a surreal and welcoming spirit of adventure, an essence that Ryder would gladly claim as his signature.</p>
<p>He lives in Alabama with his wife of 48 years and spends time reflecting on life, revisiting fond, old memories, and churning stories where he preserves his life’s adventures and experiences.</p>

<p>PORTO RAFTI, ATTIKI, GREECE, August 7, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; When Death Picks Favorites Sheds Light on the Human Side of the War</p>
<p>War impacts life unimaginably. It disrupts lives, shattering families and communities while inflicting deep emotional and psychological wounds. War also challenges moral boundaries, forcing individuals to confront ethical dilemmas and the dark specter of war crimes. When Death Picks Favorites by Lefteris Sakkas and Dimitra Iconomou is a book that might masquerade as a fictional tale but echoes reality at its core. Set against the backdrop of World War II, the book takes the readers into the lives of Antonis Krallis, a Greek-American service member, and Kurt Weinhardt, a sergeant in the Waffen SS. </p>
<p>Amid the chaos of life and death on the battlefield, both characters find themselves on an emotional journey that conveys the impact of war on the human psyche. Their silent encounter is the culmination of the reality of war, something that doesn&#8217;t make it to the headlines. </p>
<p>When Death Picks Favorites sheds light on some lesser-known facts on both sides of the conflict. It takes readers to untold stories that unfold in the shadows of war, exploring themes such as PTSD, survivor&#8217;s guilt, and the haunting specter of war crimes.</p>
<p>As readers delve into this captivating story, they discover that even in the darkest corners of history, the indomitable human spirit can illuminate a path toward resilience, redemption, and enduring hope.</p>
<p>When Death Picks Favorites is available in English, translated by Dimitra Iconomou, and Spanish on Amazon to reach a broader audience.</p>
<p>About the Authors:<br />Lefteris Sakkas, a registered nurse at a psychiatric facility, brings a unique perspective to his writing, drawing on his experiences working with trauma survivors. &#8220;When Death Picks Favorites&#8221; is his second novel translated into English.</p>
<p>Dimitra Iconomou, based in California, is a Certified Translation Professional and Greek copy editor, making her literary translation debut with this novel. She also serves as Mr. Sakkas&#8217;s literary manager in the United States.</p>

<p align="justify">NEWARK, Del, Aug.  05, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &#8212; In the latest report by Future Market Insights, Nandini Roy Choudhury estimates the global <a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9oWbOQSZrEZlnx9J4PdpupAcUviRWPLFLZ24oFOAro0d0ixf1VmmI1exXzvnp4d0LODTmKLkwnz50Iy-i4o9LmFZDqhaL0xbKO8nqJONE3qb4OVITw8PUXqS4P436eu_32JGNzzojYz8ie2w3y27CQ==" data-wpel-link="external">sourdough market</a> value to reach US$ 267.8 million in 2024. This upward trajectory is expected to continue securing 1.47x growth, with projections indicating a market value of US$ 411.2 million by 2034. This equates to a CAGR of 4.40% through the forecast period. Several factors can work together to drive this growth, but the primary force is the increasing number of health-conscious consumers that like baking sourdough bread in-house.</p>
<p align="justify">Sourdough offers features that resonate well with consumers that focus on their wellness. As such, manufacturers can take advantage to satisfy consumer demand for bread other than the standard loaves without affecting their overarching health goals. Moreover, due to the fermentation process, the sourdough naturally contains prebiotics necessary for gut health, gaining in popularity.

<p align="justify">The sourdough craze did not end in the bakery aisle. It gave rise to yet another distinct socio-economic trend. In some cases, consumers were religiously growing the sourdough starter at their end, the practice passed on as legacy recipes made from scratch. This further builds a strong sense of community and accomplishment. They are also more engaged, as it increases their involvement in the process. Social media also was a major player. Instagram and Twitter are home to online trends such as perfectly scored sourdough loaves with an open, airy crumb. Online trends such as these can inspire home bakers and drive demand for artisan sourdough from professionals. This is exactly the strategic action about which the market players take the moves.</p>
<p>When the local bakers diversify their sourdough line, they experiment with not only different flour types but also with flavors and means of fermentation, so it fits best with the tastes of customers that change periodically. Supermarkets, in the meantime, are stocking premade sourdough starters and high-quality loaves. Flour companies also incorporate such blends and the one for the best sourdough to help in the creation of those baked-at-home customers that desire to achieve a professional result.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Consumer tastes for European and want for food are expected to boost the growth rate of the dry yeast market in Western Europe</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Increased urbanization and greater demand for fast food products such as croque monsieur, pizza, etc., are driving the rapid growth of the sourdough-based market in Western Europe. Sourdough pizza base freezes better and tastes better in comparison to a traditional pizza base. As a result, this uses a by-product of sourdough pizza making which more readily lends itself to industrial production. The high demand for low-GI bread and baked goods in the European continent has led to increased demand for this particular ingredient&#8217;s products in this day and age.</p>
<p align="justify">Bread with a high glycemic index contains chemical irritants that can return blood glucose levels to peak levels very quickly. Insulin and glucose spikes lead to rapid weight gain, diabetes, and various other health problems. By contrast, low glycemic index foods contain slowly digested carbohydrates that deliver a gradually slow rise in blood glucose levels. Because of this, consumer demand for low glycemic index desserts in Western Europe tends to be greater, and manufacturers are developing and launching low glycemic index sour dough desserts to cater to this demand.</p>
<p align="justify">The increasing popularity of traditional European bakery items that do not include gluten has created a thriving market for gluten-free bread products in Western Europe. Gluten intolerance is a condition that provokes an allergic reaction to gluten, a substance that occurs in various bowls of cereal, such as wheat and barley. Celiac disease is an extreme form of gluten intolerance that afflicts a small number of people. However, the number of people affected by this growing dramatically, which will drive its impact on the population to increase.</p>
<p align="justify">Sourdough is a great alternative utilized in bakery management in Western Europe due to its tactility and capacity to improve the flavor and texture of dishes in addition to lengthening their lives. It can be used to prepare a number of different baked goods and can be applied in several approaches, from dried. powder, live liquid cultures, and starter cultures to the dough.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>What Thrives The Mining Hoses Market?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Mining hoses are in higher demand as the construction industry grows, which is strongly reliant on industrial minerals. Market growth is likely to be fueled by the rapid expansion of construction activities to support continuing economic development and large-scale projects.</p>
<p align="justify">The adoption of mining hoses is high on a global scale, as their use in a variety of applications, such as mineral extraction and mining, is likely to increase demand even more throughout the projection period. Building blocks for human development are provided by the mining sector.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>What Are The Milestones In The Mining Hoses Market?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">The global mining hose market is likely to be limited by industry-specific concerns, such as regulation, geopolitical hazards, and legal limits on the use of natural resources. Rubber hoses&#8217; low insulation performance, temperature resistance, long delivery time, and lack of product differentiation all stymie the global mining hose market&#8217;s expansion.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Competitive Landscape:</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Mines are strongly reliant on efficient operations. Improved hoses with lower friction and improved pressure management can lead to faster transfer rates and increased production. Companies are increasingly creating hoses with safety features such as burst protection and flame retardancy to reduce dangers. Due to the industry&#8217;s diverse applications, there is an increasing demand for industry-specific hoses.</p>
<p align="justify">Companies are working on extending their presence in global marketplaces. They are establishing manufacturing plants in crucial places. This allows enterprises to serve regional markets more efficiently while lowering transportation expenses.</p>
<p align="justify">Organizations are also building strong distribution networks to offer simple access to their products. Customer attentiveness is critical. Businesses are working closely with mining operations to better understand their issues and needs. Mining firms operate on a restricted budget. To differentiate their products from competition, mining hose manufacturers offer hose leasing programs or extended warranties.</p>

<p style="padding-left:0px;"><b>Segment Highlights </b> </p>
<p style="padding-left:0px;"><b>The reconstructive joint replacements segment to </b><b>maintain</b><b> its leadership status during the forecast period </b> </p>
<p style="padding-left:0px;">By product type, the reconstructive joint replacements segment dominated the market share in 2023, owing to increase in prevalence of degenerative joint diseases such as osteoarthritis, necessitating joint replacement surgeries, and advancements in implant materials, surgical techniques, and prosthetic designs have improved the outcomes and longevity of joint replacement procedures, encouraging more patients to opt for surgery. In addition, innovations in materials, such as highly durable metals, ceramics, and advanced polymers, allow for implants that closely mimic the structure and function of natural joints, resulting in better patient satisfaction and longer-lasting results further support the segment growth.  </p>
<p style="padding-left:0px;"><b>The metallic biomaterials segment to </b><b>maintain</b><b> its leadership status during the forecast period </b> </p>

<h2>The global security automation market has experienced growth due to the constantly increasing cybercrimes faced by industries like BFSI and telecommunications.  </h2>
<p align="justify">NEW CASTLE, Delaware, Aug.  05, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &#8212; Allied Market Research published a report, titled, “<strong><a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=at8Nhd_cT5PdgWT7AG_JHBRRMypubZXOFlkUkg8vEyrdpoy-o8LMx2q1ql1vHG8vf9vPtcAvKJZkJDDq9vIf33-2G2ea8lkXbhWJYHREx3JkXKB3_XcPc1yEclvub_rNzv-4Zw5NKo-JuoFErmfPQeiPgayq6X8J2S4xQ9UAtq0=" data-wpel-link="external"><u>Security Automation Market</u></a></strong> by Component (Solution and Services), Deployment Mode (Cloud and On-Premise), Technology (AI &amp; ML, Predictive Analytics, RPA, and Others), Application (Network Security, Endpoint Security, Incident Response Management, Vulnerability Management, and Others), and Industry Vertical (IT &amp; Telecommunications, BFSI, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Government, and Others): Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2024-2032”. The global security automation market was valued at $9.1 billion in 2023 and is estimated to reach $26.6 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 12.2% from 2024 to 2032. </p>
<p><strong>Prime determinants of growth  </strong></p>
<p>The cloud computing model is widely used due to its strong and adaptable architecture. Many firms are turning to cloud solutions to simplify data storage since they provide remote server access over the internet, as well as limitless computing capacity. Furthermore, having a cloud-based architecture enables businesses to monitor all of their apps by providing incredibly tough analytics that run in the background. However, the rise in adoption of cloud has increased the number of cyberattacks. This boosts the demand for real-time threat detection among enterprises, thereby propelling the growth of the security automation market.  </p>

<p><strong>Segment Highlights </strong></p>
<p>Regulatory standards such as GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS, and HIPAA compel enterprises to employ strong security measures to secure sensitive data and comply. Security automation streamlines compliance efforts by automating security controls, audits, and reporting procedures. In addition, the threat landscape is always changing, with attackers using increasingly complex methods to circumvent standard security protections. Security automation enables organizations to react fast to new threats by automating the detection, investigation, and reaction to security incidents in real time. These factors contribute to the constant growth of the global security automation market.  </p>
<p>Similarly, the adoption of cloud computing, IoT devices, BYOD rules, and hybrid IT environments has increased the complexity of IT infrastructure management and security. Here, security automation gives enterprises the scalability and agility they need to efficiently secure complex and dynamic IT systems. Moreover, it helps organizations to reduce their operational cost by automating manual and repetitive tasks. This enables enterprises to increase their efficiency and reduce manual errors.  </p>
<p><strong>Regional Outlook </strong></p>
<p>By region, the security automation market is analyzed across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and LAMEA. North America accounted for the highest share in 2023. North America has appropriate infrastructure due to the presence of prime vendors in nations such as the United States and Canada, leading to constant development of advanced security solutions integrating technologies such as AI, ML, and predictive analytics. </p>
