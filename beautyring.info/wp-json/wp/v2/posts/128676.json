With approval from the Distance Education Accrediting Commission, ACHS will be providing two individualized pathways to enable HUHS students to complete their education or transfer to an aligned ACHS program when the institution closes on August 25, 2023. <\/p>\n<p>Huntington University of Health Sciences (HUHS) is an accredited, online institution that has been offering integrative nutrition, herbal medicine, and holistic health programs since 1985. For nearly 40 years, HUHS has been devoted to holistic health and nutrition education and has offered certificates, master\u2019s degrees, and doctoral degrees to a global community. Although closing the University was a difficult decision for its leadership team, HUHS has entered into a collaborative teach-out agreement and partnership with ACHS to continue its mission of accredited online integrative health and holistic nutrition education.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m extremely pleased with the ACHS\/HUHS collaborative partnership, and I\u2019m fully confident that HUHS students will experience a relatively seamless transition to ACHS. I\u2019m likewise confident that our students will continue to experience the same high level of academic excellence at ACHS that they\u2019ve come to expect during their education with HUHS,\u201d says Gene Bruno, Provost of HUHS. \u201cI know that in this endeavor, ACHS\u2019s number one priority is our students\u2019 success.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>ACHS is committed to supporting and welcoming HUHS students and helping them to achieve their educational goals. Students will receive support during the transition through an innovative teach-out partnership and opportunities for transfer to ACHS. ACHS has dedicated team members knowledgeable to support HUHS students and is committed to welcoming students into the ACHS community and helping them continue to thrive in their education. ACHS brings experience in supporting other student communities such as the institution\u2019s similar partnership with Hawthorn University in 2021. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is more important now than ever that higher education institutions work together as a community of learners. Our commitment is to empower the success of all students and create a supportive and inclusive learning environment for everyone, and this teach-out agreement exemplifies this commitment. While we wish we were collaborating under different circumstances, we are honored to be able to continue Huntington University of Health Sciences\u2019 legacy and extend a warm welcome to its student community. I am confident that our teams will work seamlessly together to provide students with an enriching experience and support these students on their mission to bring health and wellness to their communities,\u201d shares ACHS President Tracey Abell.<\/p>\n<p>Huntington University of Health Sciences\u2019 <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/achs.edu\/teach-out-information\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">students can learn more online here<\/a>.
