For the first time, ecommerce brands and retailers can harness the power of both solutions to deliver highly personalized product recommendations within their marketing touchpoints.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s consumers expect individualized experiences both before and after they make a purchase. For merchants, that means personalizing the entire customer lifecycle\u2013from their online store to their shoppers&#8217; inboxes. From the moment a shopper visits an online store, to engaging with a brand\u2019s email campaign, this integration enables merchants to deliver a truly unique and tailored customer journey that is based on past shopping behaviors.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis integration will undoubtedly enhance the effectiveness of marketing efforts by leveraging Searchspring&#8217;s personalized product recommendations within Dotdigital&#8217;s campaigns,\u201d said Jen Kalant, Senior Director of Strategic Partnerships at Searchspring. \u201cBy combining these two powerful tools, ecommerce retailers can expect to deliver more targeted and relevant content to their audience, ultimately driving higher engagement and conversion rates. We&#8217;re excited about the opportunities this collaboration will unlock for our customers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After shoppers visit a merchant\u2019s site to browse pages and products, Searchspring\u2019s personalization algorithm makes tailored recommendations based on shopper intent. Merchants can seamlessly sync product catalogs, customer data, purchase history, and search queries to Dotdigital through their EasyEditor tool, allowing brands to display personalized product recommendations in the shopper\u2019s email.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSearchspring\u2019s site search and merchandising in combination with Dotdigital\u2019s data profiling and customer experience capabilities will allow brands to drive even more value from their campaign,\u201d said Patrick Schaeffler, Head of Technology Partnerships at Dotdigital. \u201cThe integration makes excellent use of our App blocks, giving our joint customers easy usability and access to data from both platforms.
