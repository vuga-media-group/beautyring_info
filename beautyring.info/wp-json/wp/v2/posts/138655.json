Heeren weaves an inspiring story of a preacher and his wife who make the long trek from Florida to New York to confront the new commander in chief.  <\/p>\n<p>Pastor Charles Morgen, after serving one term as president of the United States, is troubled by the evil brewing in the White House under a menacing new president who at times seems not even human. Morgen decides to confront the man, who goes by the moniker President Adam, in New York City, where anti-Christian forces working for the president have established a home base for turning the U.S.A. into an impoverished socialist land. Morgen and his wife embark on the overwhelming journey \u2014 spanning more than a thousand miles \u2014 which must be made on foot because the Morgens&#8217; car is recognizable to thugs working for the new president.  <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHalf of the book is about the Morgens&#8217; adventures while making the long walk,\u201d Heeren explained. \u201cThe conclusion of the book features a scene in which Morgen faces the new president head-on. By this time, it has become clear that persecution of the Morgens and other Christians is high on the list of plans for the new administration.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>The Coming\u2019s epic conclusion features scenes that might have been lifted directly from the book of Revelation.  <\/p>\n<p>The US Review of Books calls The Coming an \u201ceerie yet inspiring tale. \u2026 The situations in which the Morgens become mired are sometimes horrific, but their courage is sustained by uplifting miraculous incidents. Their positive roles and the perfidies of the book\u2019s villain are imaginatively drawn by Heeren, whose latest offering is sure to attract readers across a broad spectrum to this gripping, action-fraught vision grounded in biblical prophecy.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>About the Author <br \/>David Heeren is an award-winning journalist and author of 19 books. A personal prayer identical to that of Isaiah (Is. 6:8) led him to change his career emphasis from sports writing to Christian writing in 2007. Since that time, he has published 10 books with Christian themes, six of which deal with biblical end-time prophecy.
