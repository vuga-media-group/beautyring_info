Her dedication to involving young people in the creative process makes her work especially impactful and resonant. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Courage to be Kind&#8221; follows this same philosophy. More than just a book, it is an inspiring project that showcases the creativity and wisdom of young authors &#8211; aiming to spread a message of kindness and community spirit. &#8220;Courage to be Kind&#8221; celebrates the small, yet powerful, acts of kindness that turn misunderstandings into lasting friendships, in addition to teaching young readers about empathy, resilience, and the life-changing magic of forgiveness.<\/p>\n<p>The story centers on Rose and her friends in a vibrant tale where kindness resolves conflicts. After an accidental bump in the school hallway sparks tension, Rose steps up to guide her peers toward peace. With the help of Mrs. Luna and Principal Galindo, the students learn that true courage means standing up for what\u2019s right, even when it\u2019s tough. As tensions escalate, Leon, known for his quick temper, realizes that bullying is never the answer and that a sincere apology can be the bravest act of all. This book is perfect for young readers facing social challenges, showing that anyone can be a hero through kindness and learning from mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>The launch event for \u201cCourage to be Kind\u201d was attended by Principal Galindo and distinguished honorary guest, Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher. Their support and encouragement added a special touch to the celebration and, in a heartfelt gesture, Congresswoman Fletcher awarded Congressional Certificates to each of the kid consultants, Katherine Cheng-Arif, and illustrator Arnaz. This recognition honored their work on this book promoting anti-bullying, kindness, and empathy by stepping into the shoes of others.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the book launch, the Be-Leafing Foundation generously donated 700 books and 700 packets of map pencils, totaling $10,000 in value.
