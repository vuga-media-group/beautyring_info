The inspirational theme\u00a0<i>Turning History on its Head<\/i> will drive the redesign and will bring this iconic historic hotel, with its rich history in the NOLA culture, into the present-day. This vision will be reflected throughout the redesigned property including extensive exterior work upgrading the restaurant, guestrooms, guest bathrooms, corridors as well as reimagining the hotel lobby bar. Every element of the new <i>Sazz Bar<\/i> will draw inspiration from the deep amber color of the <span class=\"xn-location\">New Orleans<\/span> staple cocktail &#8212; the Sazerac &#8212; to create a moody, modern bar drenched in hues of red and orange. A lenticular art piece depicting two sides of a common French icon &#8212; a &#8216;serious&#8217; and a &#8216;spirited&#8217; Napoleon &#8212; will fill the back bar, serving as a reminder of the Hotel and the city&#8217;s historic ties to French culture and a symbol of the playful side of NOLA.<\/p>\n<p>This planned conversion will create a distinctive theme and style for the luxury Hotel that is commensurate with the distinctive premium brand Tribute Portfolio product. The Company believes that post-conversion, the new\u00a0Tribute Portfolio\u00a0property should realize a\u00a010% to 20%\u00a0RevPAR\u00a0premium\u00a0compared to a stabilized pre-conversion basis. Remington Hospitality will continue to be the property manager.<\/p>\n<p>Located in the heart of downtown <span class=\"xn-location\">New Orleans<\/span> on historic Poydras Street, the 226-room Le Pavillon Hotel is known as the &#8220;Belle of <span class=\"xn-location\">New Orleans<\/span>.&#8221; It sits adjacent to the historic French Quarter, is located only four blocks from the celebrated music clubs of Bourbon Street and is close to the famous restaurants and antique shops of Royal Street. Originally the site of one of the area&#8217;s first great plantation homes, the Le Pavillon Hotel was built in 1907 and is a member of Historic Hotels of America.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With its prime location and proximity to major demand generators in downtown <span class=\"xn-location\">New Orleans<\/span>, the transformation of this landmark hotel to a Tribute property is expected to elevate the hotel into a desirable niche in the very attractive <span class=\"xn-location\">New Orleans<\/span> market,&#8221; commented <span class=\"xn-person\">Rob Hays<\/span>, Ashford Trust&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;We remain focused on maximizing the value of our assets and look forward to realizing an enhanced financial performance from this property post conversion.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tribute Portfolio hotels participate in Marriott Bonvoy, the global travel program from Marriott International.
