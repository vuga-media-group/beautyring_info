But what exactly is cholesterol, and what kind of tests are available? <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/team\/robert-segal-md\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Dr. Robert Segal<\/a>, a board-certified cardiologist and founder of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Manhattan Cardiology<\/a>, has answers to those questions and more.<\/p>\n<p>First and most importantly, what exactly is cholesterol?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCholesterol is a natural, waxy substance made by the liver that\u2019s found in most tissues of the body. It has a lot of important uses from digestion to hormone production,\u201d says Segal.<\/p>\n<p>The liver produces enough cholesterol for all of the body\u2019s functional needs, but cholesterol can also be found in many foods. In effect, this dietary cholesterol can lead to having too much cholesterol overall in the body\u2014and in particular in the bloodstream\u2014where it starts to stick together and build up.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of cholesterol\u2019s waxiness, it can stick to the inner walls of arteries. Once that starts, more and more cholesterol tends to build up, narrowing and hardening the arteries. This increases blood pressure, decreases the supply of oxygen to the heart, and can directly cause a heart attack,\u201d says Segal.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few different types of cholesterol that are important to know about.<\/p>\n<p>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL). This is often referred to as \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol or \u201cL\u201d for \u201clousy\u201d, although the body does need a small amount of LDL cholesterol for normal functioning. Lower LDL levels are associated with lower risk of heart disease and stroke.<\/p>\n<p>High-density lipoprotein (HDL). This is often referred to as \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol. HDL cholesterol can collect extra LDL cholesterol and return it to the liver to be broken down and removed from the body. Higher HDL levels are associated with lower risk of heart disease and stroke.<\/p>\n<p>Triglycerides. This is a type of fatty compound the body uses to store extra energy. Triglycerides can be broken down later to release energy, but if the need never arises, the fat continues to build up. Lower levels of triglycerides are generally healthier.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOften times when someone\u2019s cholesterol levels are too high, there aren\u2019t any noticeable symptoms until they have a heart attack or a stroke. But if someone knows they have high cholesterol, there\u2019s a lot that can be done to lower their risk of those dramatic outcomes. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for people to regularly have their cholesterol levels tested. This is generally a simple procedure that can be performed during an annual physical,\u201d says Segal.<\/p>\n<p>There are several types of cholesterol tests available. Some are more generalized, while others have more specific uses.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7\tLipid Panel. This very common test can be performed in a doctor\u2019s office and yields results in a couple of days. Blood is drawn and sent to a laboratory for analysis. This type of test typically directly measures total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides, and then uses this information to calculate LDL levels.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7\tHDL-C test. This test is usually ordered as needed as a follow up test to a standard lipid panel. It can show whether HDL levels have gone either up or down since a previous screening.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7\tLDL-C test. Where a standard lipid panel uses a formula to calculate LDL levels, this test directly measures LDL cholesterol. For people with very high triglyceride levels, this may provide a more accurate assessment of LDL levels.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\t Lipoprotein (a) = LpA   The amount of lipoprotein in your blood is determined by a lipoprotein test. You may be at an increased risk for heart disease and stroke if you have a high level of lipoprotein (a). <\/p>\n<p>\u00b7\tCAC test. A coronary artery calcium score uses a CT scan instead of a blood draw. The scan measures the amount of calcium in the arteries around the heart to determine how much plaque is built up. This type of test can help doctors decide if someone would benefit from taking statins (a type of medication) to lower their cholesterol. The higher the calcium score, the higher risk of heart disease.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCholesterol tests are an efficient and effective way to find out if someone\u2019s cholesterol levels are too high. But that information is only useful if some sort of action is taken,\u201d says Segal.<\/p>\n<p>While statins and other medications are one available option, most of the time the most significant long-term benefits can be gained from making lifestyle changes.<\/p>\n<p>A diet low in trans fat and saturated fats, refined sugars, and red meats can help lower cholesterol. These foods can be replaced with fish, fresh vegetables, nuts, legumes, seeds, and whole grains. Regular moderate exercise, healthy sleep habits, managing stress, maintaining a healthy weight, and quitting tobacco products are also all associated with improved heart health.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe best part is that these options don\u2019t require special equipment or a prescription. They\u2019re simple concepts that most people understand intuitively. Sometimes it\u2019s just about getting back to basics,\u201d said Segal.<\/p>\n<p>Manhattan Cardiology is the premier facility for preventive cardiology treatment in New York.
