Through insightful interviews and meticulous research, she paints a nuanced picture of historical factors shaping racial divides, shedding light on how these divisions persist through generations. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn many ways, GPB serves as Georgia\u2019s storyteller by presenting content that engages our audiences and encourages a deeper understanding of our communities,\u201d said GPB CEO Bert Wesley Huffman. \u201cThe film UNSPOKEN is an important tool for starting these dialogs around our shared, complex history as Georgians.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Georgia Public Broadcasting (GPB) is the statewide public broadcasting network of nine television stations and 20 radio stations that provides PBS, NPR, and GPB original programming to Georgia and parts of neighboring states. GPB&#8217;s television stations include WGTV Channel 8 (Athens\/Atlanta), WCES Channel 20 (Augusta), WMUM Channel 29 (Macon) WVAN Channel 9 (Savannah), WJSP Channel 28 (Warm Springs\/Columbus), WACS Channel 25 (Dawson\/Albany), WNGH Channel 18 (Chatsworth), WABW Channel 14 (Pelham) and WXGA Channel 8 (Waycross). <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;UNSPOKEN&#8221; delves into the town&#8217;s collective memory, confronting contemporary challenges such as historical denial and segregation. The film urges viewers to break the silence and work towards genuine reconciliation, making it a timely call to action that bridges divides and inspires meaningful change.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Through &#8216;UNSPOKEN,&#8217; I aimed to peel back the layers of history in my own community, revealing the complex narratives of race and community that resonate far beyond our city limits,\u201d Calabrese said. \u201cThe 1946 Moores Ford Lynching serves as a stark reminder of our troubled past, yet by exploring this history with honesty and empathy, we open up vital discussions about reconciliation and the ongoing impacts of racial injustice.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUNSPOKEN\u201d has received critical acclaim and recognition, winning several prestigious awards, including the Audience Choice Award for Documentary at the Macon Film Festival, the Documentary Features Special Jury Award at the Rome International Film Festival, and the Best Documentary Award at the Reedy Reels Film Festival. It was also an Official Selection at festivals such as the Morehouse College Human Rights Film Festival, the Chagrin Documentary Film Festival, the Portland Film Festival, and the Cinema on the Bayou Film Festival. Additionally, &#8220;UNSPOKEN&#8221; has been screened at prominent educational institutions, including the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum, the University of Georgia, Emory University at Oxford College and Morehouse College.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;UNSPOKEN&#8221; was recently awarded a prestigious 5-star rating and named an Editor&#8217;s Choice by \u201cVideo Librarian.\u201d In their glowing review, \u201cVideo Librarian\u201d described the documentary as &#8220;a powerful educational tool for audiences seeking a deeper understanding of the historical roots of racial inequality and the ways in which it still permeates our society.&#8221; The review commends the film for presenting a diverse range of perspectives, allowing viewers to gain a deeper understanding of the multifaceted impact of racism on individuals and communities.
