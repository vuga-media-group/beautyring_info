It was immortalised in La Dolce Vita and embodies Italian flare in all its glory. Not only that \u2013 all the major attractions are within easy reach, including the Piazza Barberini, the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain and the ever-beautiful Borghese Gardens.<\/p>\n<p>Built in the 1940s and formerly occupied by one of the main Italian banks, the building is a striking example of the rationalist style and was created by Cesare Pascoletti in collaboration with the famed architect <span class=\"xn-person\">Marcello Piacentini<\/span>.\u00a0The stunning central staircase of rare cipollino marble from the quarries of Apuane is testament to their genius. Original features are retained throughout, including the central courtyards and original statues and lamps.<\/p>\n<p>The hotel has three unique bars, a rooftop lounge, bar and pool, a show-kitchen restaurant, a well-appointed urban wellness space with gym and treatment rooms, and a courtyard garden where guests can while away the time sipping their favourite drink\u00a0or sampling the peerless food menu from adored Roman Chef <span class=\"xn-person\">Paola Colucci<\/span>, the hotel&#8217;s chef partner. The 91 rooms, including 17 suites, have all the design elements the brand is renowned for: the muted tones, the accents of walnut wood and stunning custom designed furniture.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-location\">Rome<\/span> is a city obsessed with its food, so EDITION took great care in choosing a chef that embodies the city to lead its food offerings.\u00a0And they found her in <span class=\"xn-person\">Paola Colucci<\/span>, the self-taught founder of Roman favourite restaurant <i>Pianostrada<\/i>. Colucci came to cooking later in life, after spending 20 years in finance she left the industry to fulfil her lifelong passion of cooking and opened her first restaurant nine years ago. Alongside her best friend and business partner, <span class=\"xn-person\">Chiara Magliocchetti<\/span>, Colucci&#8217;s two daughters, Alice and Flaminia Spognetta, make up the female-led team. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Known as one of the best and most intuitive chefs in the city, she is a firm believer in the emotionality of food and the importance of interacting with her guests. It is for that reason that her kitchen at The Rome EDITION&#8217;s signature restaurant Anima will be open-fronted and screened with ambered glass, so all can admire her work. Using recipes passed down through the generations of her family, the menu includes traditional Italian dishes with a modern twist and international outlook.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The focus at The Rome EDITION will be seasonality and freshness. Guests can expect show-stopping flavours in dishes at Anima\u00a0including Chef Colucci&#8217;s version of spaghetti with roasted tomatoes and veal with tuna sauce, alongside some of the best tomato and burrata in all of <span class=\"xn-location\">Italy<\/span>. There will be a heavy emphasis on Italian wines, though other countries will of course be represented too, with a list that is primarily driven by emotion and has a heavy focus on food pairings.\u00a0The light-filled restaurant with chartreuse and blue upholstered furniture will be open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.<\/p>\n<p>In a first for the city, the hotel has an expansive lush garden that will be both piazza and dining space. It is here in the private Garden that guests begin their journey as the hotel unfolds like acts in an opera. A Roman street scape leading into the heart of the hotel, it is an indoor-outdoor space, a jungle abundant with more than 400 plants and a cascade of climbing Jasmine over the fa\u00e7ade. A dramatic bronze metal awning overlooks teak wood banquettes and free-standing furniture along with an Italianate arrangement of lanterns to give it the feel of a traditional Roman garden. The Garden provides outdoor seating for Anima one side and a relaxed all-day terrace on the other, offering a menu of light dishes available throughout the day until late evening. \u00a0Featuring old favourites and new creations the menu is accompanied by a modernist cocktail list inspired by Italian gardens and the Mediterranean.<\/p>\n<p>As with all EDITION hotels, the social heart of the hotel, The Lobby, sets the tone. With dramatic 22ft-high (<span class=\"xn-money\">7m<\/span>) ceilings, and porous travertine floors and walls it is a show-stopping space for Romans and travellers alike. Two symmetrical seating arrangements are the central axis of the space. White custom fabric sofas and coffee tables inspired by <span class=\"xn-person\">Manuel Coltri<\/span> lie next to petrified wood side tables and standing lamps. The Lobby\u00a0is EDITION at its most dynamic. It is a place to relax and make merry; a place to see and be seen or play a few games of pool on the custom-made table.<\/p>\n<p>Located on the ground floor, two unique bars set the benchmark for mixology in the city: Punch Room and <span class=\"xn-person\">Jade Bar<\/span>.\u00a0The Punch Room, EDITION&#8217;s signature bar concept, is an award-winning speakeasy-inspired bar concept that follows the standard set at other EDITION properties worldwide. Born in the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century, traditional punches utilised the exciting new ingredients discovered on the trade routes. The five traditional ingredients of punch highlighted spirits from <span class=\"xn-location\">Europe<\/span> and the colonies, spices and citrus from <span class=\"xn-location\">Africa<\/span> and the east, teas from China and <span class=\"xn-location\">India<\/span>, and sugar from the Indies. Taking inspiration from traditional recipes, Punch Room puts a modern spin on the drink. The dark walnut wood bar, with its <span class=\"xn-person\">Rosso Levanto<\/span> marble fireplace and custom armchairs in rosewood and dark brown leather, is a place where guests can unwind with friends under low lights. The perfect spot to recline on the amaranth-coloured velvet sofas and explore Punch cocktails that examine the influence of the Roman Empire, it is a convivial and relaxed space.<\/p>\n<p>Jade Bar\u00a0is an intimate mixology destination, designed to attract true connoisseurs and aficionados. Advanced techniques create a kaleidoscope of cocktails from a limited range of spirits and seasonal ingredients, effectively creating a gallery of flavour which changes throughout the year. The elevated experience of <span class=\"xn-person\">Jade Bar<\/span> is an ode to the Roman passion for honouring the finest of nature&#8217;s offerings. The intimate jewel box-like space has floor-to-ceiling green antique marble picked out with accents of satin brass and gold. Guests are encouraged to relax on the emerald velvet banquettes and take in the Jeff Koons-inspired sculptural pieces, while enjoying the unique offering.<\/p>\n<p>Located on the seventh floor, The Roof\u00a0offers unobstructed views across the city\u00a0skyline and landmarks including the Pantheon, <span class=\"xn-person\">Acqua Paola Fountain<\/span>, and Basilica of Sant&#8217;Andrea della Valle.\u00a0 The secluded spot features a large bar area, a travertine plunge pool haloed by daybeds in solid oiled teak, as well as custom bronze metal vases\u00a0dotted along the outside edge of the terrace. Take a drink at the bar counter, or a swim at the end of a hot Roman day. Chef Colucci offers raw and cooked dishes inspired by her love of the Mediterranean Sea. Likewise, the cocktails use regional citrus notes, herbs and amari to create a truly Italian list.<\/p>\n<p>The guestrooms follow the design aesthetics that EDITION is known for, but with a pronounced Italian flare. \u00a0The comfy beds are custom designed in Canaletto light walnut wood and the expansive windows bring to life this uniquely Italian tableau; Peperino stone and custom bedside tables sit alongside singular Italian artwork that adorns the walls. Each room also has a custom-made chair in beige leather, walnut wood herringbone flooring and comes equipped with a 55-inch-television. In the bathroom, guests will find a custom Carrara marble basin leaning on walnut wood, brushed brass fixtures, as well as the signature EDITION Le Labo amenities.<\/p>\n<p>The Rome EDITION is a unique offering, a new breed of boutique hotel that embraces the changing identity of the city and puts you are the heart of it all. With EDITION, there&#8217;s no place like <span class=\"xn-location\">Rome<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>The hotel is now open.<\/p>\n<p>The Rome EDITION<br class=\"dnr\"><span class=\"xn-person\">Salita di San

individualized, customized, one-of-a-kind hotels which redefines the codes of traditional luxury. Displaying the best of dining and entertainment, services and amenities &#8220;all under one roof,&#8221; each EDITION property is completely unique, reflecting the best of the cultural and social milieu of its location and of the time.<\/p>\n<p>Conceived in collaboration by <span class=\"xn-person\">Ian Schrager<\/span> and Marriott International, EDITION combines both the personal and intimate experience that <span class=\"xn-person\">Ian Schrager<\/span> is known for, with the global reach, operational expertise and scale of Marriott. The authenticity and originality that <span class=\"xn-person\">Ian Schrager<\/span> brings to this brand coupled with the global reach of Marriott International results in a truly distinct product sets itself apart from anything else currently in the marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>Each hotel, with its individuality, authenticity, originality, and unique ethos, reflects the current spirit and zeitgeist of its location. Although all the hotels look completely different from each other, the brand&#8217;s unifying aesthetic is in its approach and attitude to the modern lifestyle rather than its appearance. EDITION is about an attitude and the way it makes you feel rather than the way it looks. Sophisticated public spaces, finishes, design and details serve the experience, not drive it. For an underserved market of affluent, culturally savvy and service-savvy guests, the EDITION experience and lifestyle explores the unprecedented intersection and the perfect balance between taste-making design and innovation and consistent, excellent service on a global scale.<\/p>\n<p>EDITION currently operates 15 hotels globally: <span class=\"xn-location\">New York<\/span> and Times Square New York, <span class=\"xn-location\">London<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Miami Beach<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">West Hollywood<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Barcelona<\/span>, Bodrum, <span class=\"xn-location\">Shanghai<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Sanya China<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Abu Dhabi<\/span>, <span><span class=\"xn-location\">Dubai<\/span><\/span>, Tokyo Toranomon, <span class=\"xn-location\">Reykjavik<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Madrid<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Tampa<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT IAN SCHRAGER COMPANY<br class=\"dnr\">After leaving Morgans Hotel Group in 2005, the company he founded and created, <span class=\"xn-person\">Ian Schrager<\/span> developed his namesake, Ian Schrager Company. This company owns, develops, manages and brands hotels, residential and mixed-use projects. Since then, he has transformed the fabled Gramercy Park Hotel in <span class=\"xn-location\">New York City<\/span>, created two groundbreaking residential properties, 40 Bond and 50 Gramercy Park North, successfully launched his new brand, PUBLIC Hotels, and is currently working on multiple hotels in <span class=\"xn-location\">New York City<\/span> and two luxury residential projects; 215 Chrystie and 160 Leroy also in <span class=\"xn-location\">New York City<\/span>. In addition, Schrager in partnership with Marriott International created EDITION Hotels, a luxury lifestyle brand with properties in <span class=\"xn-location\">London<\/span>, Miami New York City, <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles<\/span>, Bodrum, <span class=\"xn-location\">Shanghai<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Tokyo<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Reykjavik<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Barcelona<\/span> and more in development around the world.<\/p>\n<p>Schrager&#8217;s brand, PUBLIC, is a new genre of hotel offering great value, great service and great style that sets a new industry standard. He has taken the best from the luxury set, the best from the boutique\/lifestyle set and the best from select service and created a new breed of hotel where everything has been rethought and every original idea updated.
