She arrived in the state of California in 1963, unfortunately, transitioning from a small town to the metropolis of Los Angeles came with many pitfalls. By the age of 16, she had been exposed to the perils of city life and observed decadence that no child should have been exposed to. Victimized by incest, physical abuse, and rape she experienced painful traumatic experiences that took me on an inevitable journey of dysfunctional behavior.<\/p>\n<p>Yet while inside the clutches of Psychological confinement, she defied all odds related to survival and gained her personal freedom. Dr. Ethridge has obtained three associate degrees in the field of Ministry, Paralegal, and Theology. Her continued academic quest resulted in earning a Bachelor of Science in Christian Education, and a Bachelor of Science in Psychology, an Addictions specialist at Liberty University. Fighting onward to regain her sense of purpose, she now holds a Master\u2019s degree in Christian Education, and Master of Arts in Marriage Family Therapy and Licensed Professional Clinical Counseling, National University, and finally Doctorate in Theology, Ministry, Christian Leadership University and an Honorary Ph.D. from Next Dimension University. <\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding, and additionally, she holds a certification as a Registered Addiction Specialist I, Peer Specialist, as well as a National Credentialed Youth Mental Health First Aid Instructor, and US Institute of Diplomacy Human Rights Consultant. Dr. Ethridge is an educator, motivational speaker, Therapist, and Mental Health Consultant. She is a member of the nation\u2019s largest accredited leadership honor society in the United States, this candidacy is a nationally recognized achievement of honorable distinction. <\/p>\n<p>For more information about The Wilted Flower, please visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/Teresa-Ethridge\/author\/B0CJH27G7K\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/Teresa-Ethridge\/author\/B0CJH27G7K<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Teresa Ethridge<br \/>Barnes &amp; Noble Publisher<br \/>+1 951-531-6785<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/661468777\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=DmnZ8HB0eQYW7-DD&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      October 13, 2023, 17:40 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/661468777\/the-wilted-flower-book-launch-dives-deep-into-themes-of-redemption-and-resilience\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
