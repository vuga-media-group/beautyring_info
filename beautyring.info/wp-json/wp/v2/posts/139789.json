This statement came during a recent reader interaction at Chung Hwa Book Store\u2019s Yau Ma Tei branch in Hong Kong on December 18, 2023. His latest novel, \u201cQiang Village,\u201d was the focal point of the event.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOf all my novels, \u2018Qiang Village\u2019 might not be the best, but it\u2019s certainly the most unique,\u201d Xue Mo proudly introduced his latest work to the audience. \u201cThough it lacks a central theme, it vividly brings to life an undefinable giant world where each character is intricately crafted and realistic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Set in western China, \u201cQiang Village\u201d revives an ancient stockade, weaving a captivating historical mystery deeply infused with local culture and traditions. The novel masterfully blends bold heroism and tribal conflicts with touching romance, delving deeply into profound themes such as life, justice, and faith.<\/p>\n<p>During the event, author Xue Mo, alongside two guest speakers \u2013 Dr. Lai Qingfang, a lecturer at the School of Chinese at HKU, and Dr. Zeng Fanyu, Assistant Professor in the Department of Chinese at HKBU \u2013 engaged in a two-hour discussion themed \u201cExploring the New Facets of Non-traditional Magical Realism through \u2018Qiang Village.\u2019\u201d The session was moderated by Mei Zi, a critic and the editor-in-chief of Hong Kong Literature Bimonthly magazine.<\/p>\n<p>After Xue Mo presented his book to the audience, Mei Zi briefly shared his understanding and even appreciation for the absence of a \u201ccentral theme\u201d in \u201cQiang Village.\u201d He compared its style to Chinese landscape painting, where reality and abstraction harmoniously coexist, creating a boundless and distant atmosphere. Mei Zi believed this style provides readers with ample space for thought and imagination. He said that truly great works are not only easy to grasp but also continuously thought-provoking, offering fresh insights upon each reading and delivering lifelong benefits to their readers.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Zeng perceived <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Selected-Stories-by-Xuemo-%E9%9B%AA%E6%BC%A0%E5%B0%8F%E8%AF%B4%E7%B2%BE%E9%80%89\/dp\/B09HJYMMG2\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=ESX4LR66J7KS&amp;keywords=selected+stories+by+xuemo&amp;qid=1703559064&amp;sprefix=selected+stories+by+xuemo%2Caps%2C97&amp;sr=8-1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Xue Mo\u2019s novel<\/a> as somewhat chaotic and unclear, mirroring the undefined nature of life itself. He contended that the depiction of Qiang Village in the novel transcends a mere historical or geographical setting, representing a broader concept deeply linked to human nature. He argued that merely labeling the novel as magical realism doesn\u2019t fully capture Xue Mo\u2019s extensive study and profound insight into the human psyche. In Zeng\u2019s view, the novel\u2019s deep exploration of humanity is presented through a distinctive narrative approach, where each character signifies different facets of the \u201cself,\u201d encouraging readers to introspect and contemplate life.<\/p>\n<p>Upon learning that \u201cQiang Village\u201d was revised four to five times before publication, Dr. Lai asked Xue Mo, \u201cAs a confident author, why do you revise your work so often?\u201d Xue Mo responded, \u201cThe revisions are my quest to find the best way to resonate with readers and make the work more readable. Writing, to me, is like panning for gold \u2013 it\u2019s about washing away all the \u2018sand\u2019 to leave only the pure \u2018gold\u2019. A work is complete only when it reaches this degree of refinement; otherwise, I would not publish it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mei Zi highly praised Xue Mo\u2019s relentless pursuit of linguistic artistry, attributing it to his respect for his readers and his deep reverence for literature. Dr. Zeng also agreed, \u201cFor a writer with ambition, frequent revision is key to perfecting their work, honing their ideas and skills in the process.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have devoted my entire life to writing, letting my works voice my mind. Creating something truly distinctive has always been my literary pursuit,\u201d Xue Mo emphasized during the sharing session. His literary works, rich in regional culture and customs, have garnered global attention. He is now a frequent visitor and active speaker at many international book fairs, including the Frankfurt Book Fair. His \u201cSelected Stories by Xue Mo\u201d has been translated into nearly 30 different languages, including French, German, and Spanish. Ever since the release of his devout work \u201cDesert Rites,\u201d Xue Mo has produced more than 100 literary and cultural works over the past four decades.<\/p>\n<p>A doctoral student majoring in Chinese literature summarized three distinct features of Xue Mo\u2019s works: a profound sentiment for local culture, extensive use of dialects and folklore, and insightful reflections on modern human existence. Dr. Zeng, an expert in the field, remarked that these three characteristics mirror the depth, breadth, and modernity of Xue Mo\u2019s writings. His works go beyond mere reflections on the past, delving deeply into the essence of contemporary society and the human condition, exploring themes such as the modern psyche, societal issues, and thoughtful considerations of humanity\u2019s future.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCompassion for the world and its people forms the undertone of my works, while <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Curses-Kingdom-Xixia-Excelsior-Editions-ebook\/dp\/B0C4G1JMJ1\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PAHT74PXD6AZ&amp;keywords=curses+of+the+kingdom+of+xixia&amp;qid=1703558662&amp;s=audible&amp;sprefix=Curses+of+the+kin%2Caudible%2C103&amp;sr=1-1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">love and wisdom<\/a> are the melodies of my life. Pursuing inner joy, and upholding truth, goodness, and beauty as my core beliefs,\u201d stated Xue Mo.<\/p>\n<p>Author Xue Mo elaborated on his creation philosophy, emphasizing that his works are not mere depictions of a specific culture or a particular nation but profound prophecies about our human fate. He cited \u201cQiang Village\u201d and \u201cDesert Hunters\u201d as examples, both of which explore recurring themes of self-destruction and internal conflict throughout history. These narratives are not only retrospective examinations of history but also serve as critiques of modern society, celebrating love and wisdom, while denouncing violence and bloodshed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEverything one gains will eventually be lost; our current existence will turn into the past, and ultimately, we will all vanish from this world. We can\u2019t change this outcome, but what we can change is the state of our existence, our inner happiness.\u201d Xue Mo elicited his personal pursuit. He also identified two cornerstones of inner happiness: love, the good intention and act of sharing one\u2019s possessions and knowledge with others, and wisdom, the art of making the right decisions in life, understanding what to reject and what to persevere in. Xue Mo\u2019s happiness philosophy is indeed evident in each of his literary and cultural works.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Xue Mo expressed his concern over humanity\u2019s collective downfall, highlighting how civilization has lost its spiritual essence due to an excessive focus on material desires and individual property rights, often at the expense of collective well-being. He called for a return of the pre-fallen state, noting that China\u2019s western region still preserves the untainted origins of human civilization. His literary works are rooted in the most authentic aspects of eastern culture, infused with contemporary elements to meet the spiritual needs of modern people. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cToday\u2019s world really needs a culture of peace and harmony, and we will try our best to promote love and wisdom via books and creative products.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIndeed, through literary works such as \u2018Qiang Village,\u2019 Xue Mo deeply probes the truths behind human nature, raising ultimate questions about life\u2019s purpose, the way of living, and the future of humanity. His books, without providing direct answers, provoke deep contemplation among readers and are poised to impact world literature significantly.\u201d Mei Zi responded.<\/p>\n<p>As the conversation progressed, Dr. Lai showed a keen interest in Xue Mo\u2019s personal growth, asking, \u201cFrom an unknown literary youth to a globally acclaimed author and scholar, have you ever felt lonely along the way?\u201d Xue Mo recalled his early days of writing: \u201cI secluded myself in a room for twenty years, all in pursuit of character refinement.\u201d He admitted to feeling lonely during those years due to the lack of readership.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the beginning, solitude is necessary, because it fosters a cognition and artistic taste that surpass the times,\u201d explained Xue Mo. \u201cWhen someone\u2019s cognition and artistic taste exceed their contemporaries\u2019, loneliness becomes inevitable. Vincent Van Gogh and the poet Li Bai are typical examples of this. But over time, as an author\u2019s cognition and artistic taste begin to resonate with readers, loneliness dissipates. Today, I really cherish my loyal fans, both domestically and internationally. My mornings spent reading with them are my happiest moments. Sharing good culture is vital; the more it is shared, the more joy it brings. Through sharing, individual happiness transforms into a collective celebration.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Throughout his career, Xue Mo has maintained deep respect and care for his readers. To him, an author\u2019s mission is to build an emotional connection with readers through words, transmitting messages of love and wisdom. This relationship transcends conventional author-reader boundaries, fostering a literary community that shares joy and nurtures growth.<\/p>\n<p>In the Q&amp;A session, a reader asked, \u201cMr. Xue Mo, can you describe your explosive writing style and how to become a better scholar?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBefore writing, I immerse myself in extensive reading, embracing diverse thoughts as rivers converge into the sea,\u201d Xue Mo replied. \u201cIn those moments, my mind becomes like the ocean, undisturbed by ego. A large stone creates big waves; a small one, gentle ripples. An earthquake triggers a tsunami, and a full moon brings the tides. This boundless mindset frees my writing, whether it\u2019s my cultural works like \u2018Xue Mo\u2019s Wisdom Class\u2019 or novels such as \u2018Qiang Village.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Regarding becoming a better scholar, Mo suggests that scholars should not be limited by rigid rules and paradigms but should present knowledge and wisdom clearly and simply. He referenced Nietzsche\u2019s approach to writing and emphasized the importance of resonating with readers, rather than simply showcasing academic skills and knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA true scholar, upon achieving academic success, should break all boundaries, allowing wisdom to flow freely into the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHong Kong, a diverse and inclusive city, has sparked my creativity. I feel a deep connection with this dynamic city,\u201d said Xue Mo. He expressed his hope to make Hong Kong his new \u201clandmark\u201d for future inspirations, drawing from its vibrant energy to enrich his future works.<\/p>\n<p>This book sharing session was co-sponsored by Hong Kong Zhonghua International Media Publishing Group and Hong Kong Shangpa Culture Distribution Co., Ltd.<\/p>\n<p>Tips: <br \/>Grab a  New Book &#8220;Curses of the Kingdom of Xixia &#8221;  by Xue Mo  on Amazon <br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Curses-Kingdom-Xixia-Excelsior-Editions-ebook\/dp\/B0C4G1JMJ1\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PAHT74PXD6AZ&amp;keywords=curses+of+the+kingdom+of+xixia&amp;qid=1703558662&amp;s=audible&amp;sprefix=Curses+of+the+kin%2Caudible%2C103&amp;sr=1-1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Curses-Kingdom-Xixia-Excelsior-Editions-ebook\/dp\/B0C4G1JMJ1\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PAHT74PXD6AZ&amp;keywords=curses+of+the+kingdom+of+xixia&amp;qid=1703558662&amp;s=audible&amp;sprefix=Curses+of+the+kin%2Caudible%2C103&amp;sr=1-1<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Ida<br \/>RUXUE INTERNATIONAL MEDIA INC<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/677341300\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/shangpaculture\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/selectedxuemo\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@xuemoauthor\/videos\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Thank you !
