As the critical aide-de-camp to dozens of aspiring artists and proven superheroes, it seems he\u2019s always been in demand through a voluminous 35-year professional career. Is it because he sensed the needs of his \u2018client\u2019 and \u2018the project\u2019 with such zeal and focus that his friendship and trust inevitably elevated what could have been a mere business liaison? Russell\u2019s reputation in music circles is one of a man willing to stand unwavering in the gap. <\/p>\n<p>That commitment led to decades of working in various capacities with renown artists and bands like The Call and its lead singer Michael Been, U2, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Mark Heard, Amy Grant, Sam Phillips, Andy Pratt, Bruce Cockburn, Switchfoot, Robin Lane, The Vigilantes of Love, Ramona Silver, Rachel Taylor, The Violet Burning and more. <\/p>\n<p>In \u201cthose younger days,\u201d Russell wasn\u2019t \u2018business oriented&#8221; at all. After high school, as a singer and guitarist, Russell\u2019s great pastime became songwriting.  \u201cIt was just a cathartic exercise. I\u2019d get together with friends, and we would share our songs. We had a desire to convey our thoughts to music and it was fun.\u201d But over time, his solo voice submerged, supplanted by writing collaborations, productions, or projects that came his way. \u201cI would befriend or get close to artists. They\u2019d say something like, \u2018Hey, I just recorded a record for a label; do you know how I can get a band?\u2019 So, I\u2019d push my stuff aside and work on their projects.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>One of Russell\u2019s colleagues and closest friends was American folk \u2013- rock singer\/ songwriter\/ producer, and poet, Mark Heard. Heard produced or performed with many artists including Sam Phillips, Michael Been of The Call, Buddy Miller, Pierce Pettis, Phil Keaggy, Vigilantes of Love, Peter Buck of R.E.M., The Choir, and Randy Stonehill among others. <\/p>\n<p>From Macon, GA, Mark Heard was one of the finest songwriters of our time, according to Russell. \u201cHe was an incredible musician and lyricist -linguistically &#8216;cinemagraphic&#8217;, he painted extraordinary paintings with his words. It was another whole level of writing. Mark also mathematically understood nearly every instrument, how to perform with them. He could play anything. He was unique, authentic, and genuine, but he was also understated. Overstated people will let you down, while understated people will surprise you\u2026 they can lead you to a whole new way of seeing life,  navigating your journey. Mark\u2019s music contains that essence. He was a beautiful artist who had no idea how incredibly talented he was.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About working with Heard, and how their label, Fingerprint Records, came about, \u201cI met Mark and his wife Janet while they were touring through New England. We became close and began to work together. He struggled with the limitations of the Christian music industry where he had released his first recordings. That created conflict in him and us and doing Fingerprint kept us all on our own path, and away from that conflict. Together with Mark\u2019s life long friend, Chuck Long, we created Fingerprint Records and started to put out Mark\u2019s work independently to see what would happen.\u201d Heard\u2019s Fingerprint releases were successful and generated interest from a few major labels. During that time, Russell worked on three album projects with Mark Heard, \u2018Dry Bones Dance\u2019, \u2018Second Hand\u2019, and \u2018Satalite Sky\u2019 and they released each recording themselves on Fingerprint. Russell re-released \u2018Dry Bones Dance\u2019 just last year and created a lyric video for the title song, with Heard singing his own music. <\/p>\n<p>Heard had released sixteen albums prior to his untimely death in 1992. In the years since his passing, his songs have been covered by a wide range of artists, including on tribute albums. The track \u2018I Just Wanna Get Warm\u2019 was first released by Heard\/ Fingerprint Records in 1991 on his second Fingerprint release, &#8216;Second Hand&#8217;. Russell covered the song on an album he produced entitled &#8216;The Strong Hand of Love&#8217;, a compilation of Mark\u2019s songs by various artists. &#8220;\u2018I Just Wanna Get Warm\u2019 was one song I felt should make it on that record. No artist had picked it to cover for this tribute project. I was the producer, but because no one else chose it, I picked it. I just felt it was important to include. I did not record \u2018I Just Wanta Get Warm\u2019 like Heard, and the whole process happened quickly, it came together effortlessly. I was in a session in Toronto working with a few very talented musicians organized by Chatman bass Stick player, Fergus Marsh. A couple of quick takes later, the basic track was recorded, and the only thing left was the vocals and mixing.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Russell\u2019s friend and talented engineer\/producer, Jim Scott (Tom Petty, Sting, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Rolling Stones\u2026.) had worked on Mark\u2019s \u2018Satellite Sky\u2019 Fingerprint release. \u201cGot on a call and discovered a studio that was blocked out by Michael Jackson wasn\u2019t being used, so Jim invited me to come out to lay down the vocals for the track.\u201d  Russell took him up on the generous offer and together with Dan\u2019s brother Joel who sang background vocals, \u2018I Just Wanna Get Warm\u2019 was mixed and  quickly completed.<\/p>\n<p>Out of the 45-50 Mark Heard songs that were finished for the tribute project, Russell picked 20 and the album, \u2018The Strong Hand of Love\u2019 was released in 1994, with proceeds to benefit the Heard Family Fund. Creating that record started in 1992 and was finished in 1994. \u2018Orphans of God\u2019, a double disc compilation included all of the songs on \u2018Strong Hand of Love\u2019 as well as several other beautiful versions of Mark\u2019s songs, released 1996. &#8216;The Strong Hand of Love&#8217; and &#8216;Orphans of God&#8217; albums are both available on Spotify.<\/p>\n<p>Russell\u2019s version of \u2018I Just Wanna Get Warm\u2019 became a top twenty single on Americana Radio and later that year, Russell was nominated for a Grammy for producing this compilation. He stated it was a big surprise, but wonderful as it shined more light on Mark\u2019s legacy of music. A visual was later created for this track, and as the audio was just updated, the video is being re-released this month in the hopes of sharing Mark Heard\u2019s music during these trying times. \u201cMark has still not received the acclaim his songwriting deserves. He was a Renaissance man, and he created soul connecting music, visceral and reawakening and it is much more relevant today. I only wish he had more good fortune, more time, more claim while he was here with us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About the re-release of this song and video, Russell stated, \u201cI hope people say who is Mark Heard and they do a deep dive,  listen and discover this amazing artist. We are souls with a body, not bodies with a soul. And we are not strapped to these bodies forever. So, why not think ahead and finally be free, and get warm now. You can feel that by listening to this song. We are on a journey, all of us, and it is what Mark\u2019s work was about. He is worth discovering.\u201d To learn more <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/M8VnG-iXTY0\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">about Mark Heard\u2019s life<\/a>, an overview can be viewed on YouTube at: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/M8VnG-iXTY0\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/youtu.be\/M8VnG-iXTY0<\/a>.
