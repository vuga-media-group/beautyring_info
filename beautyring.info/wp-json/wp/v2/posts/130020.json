He began as a young leader in Mercury Control in the 1960s and his career covers the complete arc of manned spaceflight missions.  He\u2019s probably best known as the leader of the \u201cTiger Team\u201d flight controllers who in 1970 returned a crippled spaceship safely to Earth \u2013 a nail-biting role made famous by actor Ed Harris in the movie \u201cApollo 13.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The core lesson of his new book, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Tough-Competent-Leadership-Team-Chemistry\/dp\/1662933312\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">TOUGH AND COMPETENT<\/a>, is that leadership and culture, not hardware and software, are the critical assets to manage and control high risk ventures. Kranz documents the leadership and teamwork principles that emerged from an organization of novice, part-time engineers in NASA Mercury Control. By July 1969, when faced with the stress of the Apollo 11 mission to land Americans on the moon, they had matured into a group of hardened individuals empowered to make the split-second decisions to land with only 17 seconds of fuel remaining. <\/p>\n<p>What had changed? Team chemistry, IT! is the unifying soul of operations that emerged from the leadership, working, and social environment to achieve organizational excellence. Mission Control could quickly address the risks and complexity of spaceflight operations. The intangible element, IT!, elevates performance to where the impossible becomes commonplace. <\/p>\n<p>IT! was born in a bare-bones warehouse floor work environment where learning by doing developed the materials for flight. Controllers spanned diverse backgrounds: Philco tech reps, farm boys, Native Americans, and junior college grads who became self-made engineers. A free exchange of knowledge developed expertise among colleagues. Everyone brought unique viewpoints and skills which coalesced into IT! <\/p>\n<p>In relaying his long tenure at NASA, Kranz narrates the development of IT! and how it began with a watershed moment. When he addressed a stunned team after the tragic loss of Apollo 1, Kranz delivered his \u201cKranz Dictum\u201d that &#8220;Tough&#8221; and &#8220;Competent&#8221; were the new tenants of Mission Control.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTough means we are forever accountable for what we do or what we fail to do,\u201d writes Kranz. \u201cWe will never again compromise our responsibilities. . .. Competent means we will never take anything for granted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Moving innovation forward was never simple. From Gemini to Apollo launches, the Skylab program, and the stunning loss of the Challenger crew, Kranz was the face of NASA leadership. His views on lessons learned through decades of Mission Control are valuable for any innovation-based organization.<\/p>\n<p>Praise is already pouring in for TOUGH AND COMPETENT.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cKranz captures the essence of the development of leadership and team chemistry, the IT! of the Control teams who worked around the clock to overcome a seemingly impossible challenge to provide a great Hollywood ending to our mission.\u201d &#8211;Fred Haise, Astronaut, Apollo 13<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA checklist for personal and organizational greatness.

He was portrayed by Ed Harris in the 1995 movie \u201cApollo 13.\u201d  Born and raised in Toledo, Ohio, Kranz holds a BS in Aeronautical Engineering from Parks College of Saint Louis University and served in the U.S. Air Force as a fighter pilot and a flight test engineer before joining NASA in 1960. He assumed Flight Director duties for the Project Gemini and Apollo missions, including leading the controller team for America\u2019s first lunar landing during Apollo 11 in 1969. In 1983, Kranz assumed NASA Director of Mission Operations overseeing a workforce of more than 5,000.<\/p>\n<p>After serving in Mission Control for over 100 launches and effectively overseeing the complete arc of U.S. manned space missions, Kranz retired in 1994 turning to motivational speaking and writing. His book on the early manned space program, Failure Is Not an Option, was a New York Times bestseller and adapted as a 2004 History Channel documentary on Mission Control.<\/p>\n<p>Kranz has received numerous awards, including the National Space Trophy and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and he is enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame. His alma mater, Central Catholic in Toledo, displays his NASA Ambassador of Exploration Award alongside other personal NASA mementos. In 2021, the city of Toledo honored its native son when it renamed its airport in honor of Kranz. A Texan for over five decades, Kranz and his wife Marta are the proud parents of six children.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Eugene Kranz<br \/>BookTrib<br \/>+1 203-226-0199<br \/>jim@merylmossmedia.com<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=GV6h0DtFi6T-qizM&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      August 21, 2023, 15:15 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/641609747\/the-face-of-nasa-mission-control-chronicles-his-career-with-valuable-lessons-in-leadership-and-team-chemistry\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
