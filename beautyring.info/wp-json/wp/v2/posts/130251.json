Hip and knee arthroplasty patients are likely to suffer from serious side effects called prosthetic joint infections (PJIs), which may necessitate revision surgery.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">PJIs are debilitating complications arising from joint replacement surgeries, demanding timely diagnosis and effective treatment for patient recovery. Increasing number of total hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries is likely to raise the incidence of PJI.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An investigation into prosthetic joint infections featured in the NIH (National Institutes of Health) Journal 2023 indicates that the occurrence of PJIs is approximately <strong>1%<\/strong> to <strong>2%<\/strong> in primary arthroplasty and <strong>4%<\/strong> in revision arthroplasty.<\/li>\n<li>In the United States, hip replacement surgeries constitute <strong>0.5% to 1%<\/strong> of the cases, while the infection incidence rate post knee replacement is <strong>0.5%<\/strong> to <strong>2%<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">Morbidity and mortality associated with PJIs are significant. Additionally, the cost of treating PJIs is also substantial.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the United States, healthcare spending on PJI treatment was estimated to be <strong>US$ 1.62 billion<\/strong> in 2020, according to the Annals of Joint (2021).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Stay Ahead with Market Intelligence Get Free Sample Copy@ <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=5bctXYOndy8E_imGEYVBMjrKrHN32Hu83BW1BfTiVYFfxaZJmeSLw48nHB9wfP1l8tea-g5MefgVb8uh_ffi1e2KnI4Ax_9AcsoglHE7sZrRVZKMKmt356aJMx0Kjwz0jOrhEz9NuCYEf9oa3buokzAHtJJH3lcYETOfC0Id-K-lqGUUMHgxWWri6aapdfzr\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>https:\/\/www.persistencemarketresearch.com\/samples\/29797<\/u><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Preoperative infections, systemic septicemia, immunological suppression, lifestyle variables, and poor hygiene are a few risk factors associated with PJI. Due to the effect of PJIs on patient outcomes and healthcare expenses, it is crucial to pay attention to efficient treatment modalities.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Treatment success hinges on early diagnosis, surgical intervention, and long-term antibiotic therapy. Long-term IV antibiotics and surgical approaches are two possible treatments. Surgical options further include five treatment options, such as debridement, antibiotics, and irrigation with implant retention (DAIR) therapy, one-stage exchange, two-stage exchange, resection arthroplasty, and above-knee amputation. <\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">DAIR is gaining attention due to its simplicity, shorter recovery time, and reduced physiological damage. DAIR procedures can result in improved quality of life comparable to uninfected cases.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In bedridden patients or those with severe co-morbidities, when surgery is not an option, chronic suppressive antibiotic therapy is often employed. Thus, increasing joint replacement surgeries, growing PJI incidence, and availability of novel diagnostic and treatment modalities are predicted to fuel the demand for prosthetic joint infection treatment over the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If You want to Purchase Specific Insights By Segment\/Region\/Competitor, Request For Customization@ <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=5bctXYOndy8E_imGEYVBMjrKrHN32Hu83BW1BfTiVYFfxaZJmeSLw48nHB9wfP1lU6L8Ylm2k76IJgVMDoKY6Rs_AZ29dM-6GUQ8tcXc3A10jrHucOp2scncGUBqINhqJk6pvEhUGYIpvcwzvY0RlM8kYd8mruFO1ain0u8owD3drHY7FazhSV1aE4jKR80puLqenUTWDG0ucPDAAbAFjiWiFrIEw813Pa3HcfBwick=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>https:\/\/www.persistencemarketresearch.com\/request-customization\/29797<\/u><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Key Takeaways from Market Study<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The global prosthetic joint infection treatment market is projected to reach a size of <strong>US$ 170 million<\/strong> by 2033-end.<\/li>\n<li>By drug, glycopeptides contributed <strong>US$ 34.1 million<\/strong> to the global market in 2022.<\/li>\n<li>By infection, post-operative infections accounted for a market value of <strong>US$ 79 million<\/strong> in 2022.<\/li>\n<li>By route of administration, the intravenous segment amounted to <strong>US$ 67.9 million<\/strong> in 2022.<\/li>\n<li>By pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus held <strong>35.8%<\/strong> of the global market in 2022.<\/li>\n<li>By distribution channel, hospital pharmacies held <strong>45.7%<\/strong> market share in 2022.<\/li>\n<li>North America led the global market with the United States accounting for <strong>US$ 23.3 million<\/strong> in 2022.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>\u201cLeading manufacturers are increasingly prioritizing the development of novel therapeutics for addressing prosthetic joint infections,\u201d <\/em><\/strong>says an analyst at Persistence Market Research.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Market Competition<\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Market players are pursuing a variety of strategies to accommodate the increased demand for prosthetic joint infection treatments.
