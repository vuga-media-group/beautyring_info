The first of the two ships, new-build <i>Star Seeker<\/i> which is currently being constructed in the WestSEA shipyard, is expected to be delivered in December of 2025, followed by <i>Star Explorer<\/i> in December, 2026.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal was to ensure these ships are unmistakably Windstar, and a significant amount of effort has gone into achieving this,&#8221; says Windstar Cruises&#8217; President <span class=\"xn-person\">Christopher Prelog<\/span>. &#8220;We are thrilled for this expansion, building on the success of our game-changing <span class=\"xn-person\">Star Class<\/span> in small-ship cruising with guests and travel partners, while offering new experiences. This growth reflects the dedication of our incredible crew and team, allowing us to broaden our destination portfolio and even bring one of our Wind Class sail ships back to Tahiti.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Each ship has 112 suites, featuring full private verandas and infinity windows, ensuring unparalleled views for every guest onboard. Additionally, two new Owner&#8217;s Suites with wrap-around balconies have been added to the aft of the ship, perfect for evening cocktails or a private dinner. With a capacity for 224 guests and a staff to guest ratio of 1:2, the ships maintain an intimate atmosphere, ensuring personalized service at every turn.<\/p>\n<p>Guests will also enjoy access to several newly added Windstar guest favorites, including the brand&#8217;s iconic Watersports Platform with all-new staircase access, the cozy Yacht Club caf\u00e9 and lounge, a two-story spa and fitness facility, an intimate forward whirlpool on the bow, and a spacious open deck perfect for sunbathing and Windstar&#8217;s famous deck barbeques.<\/p>\n<p>As the Official Cruise Line of the James Beard Foundation<b><sup>\u00ae<\/sup><\/b>\u00a0(JBF), Windstar&#8217;s commitment to exceptional cuisine will continue to be a priority\u00a0for the guest experience.

Al fresco dining will now be available at both Amphora and the Star Grill. A no-charge specialty restaurant and 24-hr room service rounds out the four dining options.<\/p>\n<p><i>Star Seeker<\/i>\u00a0and <i>Star Explorer<\/i> both have ice-strengthened hulls, unlocking access to new destinations. The ships are equipped with the latest technology in safety, propulsion, and navigation, including pump jet thrusters and forward-facing Sonar. To minimize their environmental footprint and uphold the brand&#8217;s commitment to sustainability, the ships have tier III Nox rated Rolls Royce engines and can connect to shore power minimizing port emissions. In addition, the ships have advanced wastewater treatment systems that meet all global standards. Every aspect of their design reflects the company&#8217;s ongoing commitment to preserving the environment while providing unforgettable experiences to travelers.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Andrew N.
