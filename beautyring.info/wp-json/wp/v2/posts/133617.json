Her name is Niki Tino\u2026 that\u2019s Doctor Niki Tino.<\/p>\n<p>She is the heroine of a new <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.comicconnect.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">comic book<\/a> co-created by <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.theaddiction.co\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Vincent Zurzolo<\/a>, president of Metropolis Collectibles and ComicConnect, and David Quinn, the comic book writer behind such titles as \u201cFaust\u201d and Marvel\u2019s \u201cDoctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme.\u201d It\u2019s drawn by Claudia Balboni, the Italian comic book artist and Eisner Award nominee for \u201cKiller Queens\u201d (Dark Horse).<\/p>\n<p>Zurzolo, who knows a few things about pop culture, says, \u201cNiki\u2019s strange powers and character are unique in pop culture. Her mission to use drugs to fight the destruction and pain caused by drugs is heroic in a way we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Besides being smart, sexy and dangerous, she\u2019s also conflicted, in her family background (the adopted daughter of an addicted Italian American mother and Chinese American father) and love (her boyfriend Enzo, to whom she\u2019s reluctant to reveal her full self).<\/p>\n<p>The stories are set in iconic New York City locales and restaurants, along with a cast of evil drug lords and bizarre bad guys who stir in some harrowing flashbacks, creating a tasty Italian-flavored zuppe with enough spice, action and R-rated dialogue to intrigue seasoned comic book readers and newcomers to the genre.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think this is going to appeal to a number of people,\u201d Zurzolo says. \u201cPeople who are into interesting, strange, quirky worlds; female audiences because of the strong positive role model; a broader audience of collectors because of my background in comics and presence in vintage books \u2013 and people who haven\u2019t bought a brand new comic book in decades.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.theaddication.co\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">The Addiction<\/a>\u201d is more than just a comic book. With Zurzolo\u2019s and Quinn\u2019s connections in the industry, the creators lined up an A-list of contributors and a unique deal with VeVe, the multibillion-dollar digital collectible comic book company. And, for the first time ever, a comic book is being launched in conjunction with a New York restaurant.<\/p>\n<p>VeVe, which produces all the digital editions for DC and Marvel, has chosen \u201cThe Addiction\u201d as its first foray into offering an original VeVe variant print comic, along with a digital version.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with them to create a digital red cover and digital blue cover, limited to 1,000 copies of each,\u201d Zurzolo says.<\/p>\n<p>Stanley \u201cArtgerm\u201d Lau, a creator of digital comic covers, designed two covers for \u201cThe Addiction.\u201d Also participating in the project is artist David Mack, whose character Echo \u2013 once a sidekick to Daredevil \u2013 is about to have her own series on Disney+. Additional contributors include up-and-coming superstar cover artist Andres Labrada, Eisner Award-winning artist Alitha Martinez, colorist Brad Simpson and letterer Dave Sharpe.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Addiction\u201d is also very much of New York City, with scenes set in Washington Square Park, Greenwich Village, and even the corner of Bleecker and Mercer (Enzo\u2019s apartment) and Niki\u2019s condo in the converted Sugar Building at West and Laight. So Quinn anticipates \u201cThe Addiction\u201d will have a deep reach into the New York market as well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEveryone is addicted to something,\u201d Quinn says, \u201cwhether it\u2019s drugs, sugar, food, social media. I want to make a strong point that we are not sensationalizing drug use. We will have ads with 800 numbers for people who are having trouble with drug addiction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Food as nourishment and obsession is everywhere in \u201cThe Addiction.\u201d Niki must frequently refuel by consuming copious amounts of food.  So it made sense to find partners in the food and restaurant industry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grimaldi\u2019s, in the Limelight Marketplace, will feature The Addiction Special Pizza Pie (pepperoni, mushrooms, truffle oil) that comes with a QR code so diners can read part of the comic book and purchase it.<\/p>\n<p>Subsequent issues of the comic will promote M\u00ecL\u00e0, purveyor of authentic, hand-made frozen Chinese soup dumplings, and Zurzolo\u2019s favorite coffee place in Manhattan, Culture Espresso. He envisions not only product placements, but also possible appearances by Niki Tino herself.<\/p>\n<p>During the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, Zurzolo remembers thinking, how do we know when our number\u2019s up? \u201cAnd,\u201d he mused, \u201cif I died tomorrow, what is the one thing I would regret never doing?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The long-time comic book collector and businessman &#8212; who\u2019s made million-dollar sales of vintage comic books time and again &#8212; had a ready answer: Launch his own comic book, something he dreamed of as a kid from Queens who started collecting comics back when they cost 35 cents.<\/p>\n<p>He and Quinn wrote and drew a comic book in 1997. And there it sat, for 23 years, until the  pandemic brought it back to life. Which, when you think about it, is not unlike the hero\u2019s  resurrection. <\/p>\n<p>In 2020, Zurzolo got back in touch with Quinn to finish what they had started. Nick Tino, male narcotics cop, became Niki Tino, a doctor and daughter of a heroin addict.<\/p>\n<p>The first three-issue story arc of \u201cThe Addiction\u201d will be available at comic book stores and online (TheAddiction.co) starting in November. \u201cIf readers enjoy \u2018The Addiction\u2019 a fraction of how much we have enjoyed creating it, it will all have been worth it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Joanne Levine<br \/>Lekas &amp; Levine PR<br \/>joannepr@aol.com<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=suq2b3zbFJOsYA2p&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      October 06, 2023, 19:11 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/660136905\/the-addiction-comic-book-expert-vincent-zurzolo-fulfills-childhood-dream-of-creating-one-himself\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
