With guests expecting more from their dining experiences than ever before, these solutions were purpose-built to solve real pain points for hospitality operators. These include alerting a specific diner about reservation availability, providing new ways for guests to get in touch and making it easier for guests to recommend their favorite restaurants to friends and family.<\/p>\n<p><b>Priority Alerts<\/b>\u00a0helps operators control who they send automated reservation availability notifications to so they can prioritize their most valuable guests. In comparison to other reservation notification systems, restaurants choose who receives a Priority Alert first, not just deciding between a blast to their entire waitlist or to an exclusive subset of credit card holders. Instead, they can prioritize the guests that matter most to their business &#8211; whether that&#8217;s a VIP, loyalty member, frequent or recent diner, local, high spender, or someone else. This helps restaurants reward their most valuable guests to get them through their doors more often.<\/p>\n<p><b>Private Line<\/b>\u00a0was created to give important guests an easier, faster way to get in touch with their favorite restaurants. With Private Line, restaurants can now offer their high-value guests \u2013 like VIPs, press, frequent diners and top spenders \u2013 an exclusive messaging line that can be used to instantly get in touch with their team. Whether a guest is looking for a last-minute reservation, has a special request, needs to add a friend to a booking or another ask, restaurants no longer miss out on opportunities to wow the guests that matter most. All conversations are centralized within the SevenRooms mobile app, making it easy for staff to book a table, add in requests or make other changes with just a few clicks.<\/p>\n<p><b>Word-of-Mouth Referrals<\/b>, the third consumer-facing feature launching with our fall release, gives restaurants the ability to motivate, track and reward loyal guests for referring new diners. According to <u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4037150-1&amp;h=4247232192&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fsevenrooms.com%2Fen%2Fpress%2Fsevenrooms-consumer-data-unveils-how-guests-are-discovering-and-booking-restaurants%2F&amp;a=recent+data\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">recent data<\/a><\/u>, 61 percent of diners discover new restaurants from friends, family and co-workers. Yet, without an easy way to capture this untapped demand, restaurants have historically left dollars on the table. Word-of-Mouth Referrals automatically creates personal referral links for every diner \u2013 shared through post-meal surveys and automated email campaigns \u2013 making it simple for guests to share with their networks and be rewarded with perks they&#8217;ll want to earn and use. Restaurants can tap into this high-value marketing channel for their business, rewarding loyalty and ensuring exceptional experiences for newcomers and regulars that translate into more sales and profits.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At SevenRooms, our focus from day one has been on building innovations that help operators increase profitability, drive sales and improve the experiences of their guests. These three new features, all integrated into the SevenRooms platform, give operators new ways to connect and communicate with their guests \u2013 helping them evolve to meet the needs of guests who know what they want, how they want it, when they want it,&#8221; said <b><span class=\"xn-person\">Angela DeFranco<\/span>, VP of Product at SevenRooms.<\/b> &#8220;In an increasingly competitive landscape where consumers have more choice than ever before in where they choose to take their business, we&#8217;re dedicated to finding new ways for restaurants to connect and market more effectively to their guests with tools that not only make them more money, but help them execute on experiences that guests remember and recommend. Restaurant marketing is no longer one-size-fits-all, and we are redefining the role that technology can play in creating truly personalized guest engagement and marketing touchpoints at every stage of the guest journey.&#8221;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The plan was to always move to SevenRooms because the technology was far superior, the potential for integration with our point of sale system was a lot stronger and owning the data was a huge deal,&#8221; said <b><span class=\"xn-person\">Kim McDiarmid<\/span>, Partner at Liquid and Larder<\/b>. &#8220;SevenRooms&#8217; Priority Alerts has been a dream for us. Compared to our previous platform, it&#8217;s a lot more customizable and fully automated so it does the heavy lifting for us. We&#8217;re going to use it to give priority to guests who match criteria such as those who dine with us regularly, and with that, it will work even harder for us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For more details on SevenRooms&#8217; newest innovations, please visit <u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4037150-1&amp;h=776569738&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fsevenrooms.com%2Fnew%2F&amp;a=sevenrooms.com%2Fnew\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">sevenrooms.com\/new<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<p><b>About SevenRooms <br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>SevenRooms is a guest experience and retention platform that helps hospitality operators create exceptional experiences that drive revenue and repeat business.
