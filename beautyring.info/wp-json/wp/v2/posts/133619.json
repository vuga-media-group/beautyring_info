Neither is wrong, but the latter just might be the better option, as Hebrews 11:1 says, \u201cNow faith is the full assurance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\u201d This is exactly what poet Claudette Inglis believes in too and what her book, &#8220;Heartfelt Expressions,&#8221; is all about.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Heartfelt Expressions&#8221; is a collection of Christian poetry depicting a life of sacrifice and yearning. Each poem touches on a different theme or topic\u2014from heartbreak to knowing God a little bit deeper every day and then bouncing back.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe poems explore different themes, such as courage, divine intimacy, conviction, provision, and faith. Additionally, through her poems the poet pays homage to the people in her life who helped encourage, guide, support, and celebrate,\u201d R.J. Johnson of US Review of Books comments.<\/p>\n<p>Simultaneously healing and inspiring, &#8220;Heartfelt Expressions&#8221; easily urges readers to see beyond what is and reflect. A guide, a friend, and a teacher are what the book truly is.<\/p>\n<p>A certified Christian minister in Christian counseling, Claudette Inglis also is a retired nurse. She enjoys jazz, gospel, and classical music. In June 2000, she served as the public relations coordinator for a singing group called Sons and Daughters of Durham. In September 2001, she had a stroke, which paralyzed her left side, but, she carefully and thankfully, recovered from it through therapy. Claudette writes to connect with people and share with them God\u2019s greatness.<\/p>\n<p>Get ready for an exciting event! Claudette Inglis is set to shine as she joins the renowned Emmy Award-Winning Newsman, Logan Crawford, for an engaging interview later this month.
