The mirrors are equipped with sensors that utilize electrochromism to detect light emitted by the headlights of trailing vehicles. This detection process enables the mirrors to darken, effectively eliminating glare.<\/p>\n<p>The mirrors are composed of a variety of sophisticated sensors and electrochromic material that exhibit differential light absorption and reflection properties when subjected to an electric voltage. These sensors are designed to detect a stronger light source during nighttime or in low-light conditions.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" height=\"406\" name=\"GNW_RichHtml_External_IMG\" src=\"https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/uploads\/reports\/1708438537-auto-dimming-mirror-market.svg\" width=\"800\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Download Free Sample Report PDF @\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=Z2-D6E9YVVXR5TY_xYWotRgu6DmAJecaqJmxBn58t2yKm7bV9lnPS3N2O_EXZho1W1coPqurDv6jJgGfDtlHA0Z_LNvbq1UD3zE0GPQyqQna6zchatcd9pQApEi7TyH6vKbgLQC4PyzZyESclxB4dT10g4wt1puosbNjsp_GrDOXc6Ve0yTZJXcxXvq5Y9yMFRai6FxMC3zYbPRhKm-0Q597EhWlMMXBT26eDOQIcQw=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/auto-dimming-mirror-market\/request-sample<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Market Dynamics<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Increasing Demand for Advanced Features Drives the Global Market<\/b><\/p>\n<p>According to Straits Research, <strong><em>\u201cThe global auto-dimming mirror market size was valued at USD 2,265.23 million in 2022. It is expected to reach USD 3,545.18 million by 2031, registering a CAGR of 5.1% during the projected period (2023\u20132031).\u201d<\/em><\/strong> The global market for auto-dimming mirrors is anticipated to rise due to an increased consumer preference for advanced features in vehicles, including but not limited to dimming mirrors, LED headlights, parking assists, and lightning assistance. While the inclusion of these modern amenities does increase the overall cost of the car, buyers are willing to allocate additional funds to avail themselves of innovative, convenient, and pleasant features.<\/p>\n<p>The rising sales of premium automobiles positively influence the global auto dimming market. The sales performance of luxury automobile products by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) has exhibited robustness, as evidenced by the positive growth reported by prominent manufacturers such as Ferrari, Mercedes, BMW, and Volvo in 2018.<\/p>\n<p><b>Production of Cloud-Based Auto Dimming Mirrors Creates Tremendous Opportunities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The incorporation of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud-based features into auto-dimming mirrors is expected to increase significantly, resulting in economic prospects on a global scale. Garage doors, wireless gate controls, temperature and tire pressure monitors, GPS systems, blind spot detection, Bluetooth and hands-free communication, garage doors, home lighting, and other home automation capabilities are among the features available.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, in order to compete in the global market, numerous organizations are focusing on inventing new goods with these attributes. For instance, Gentex Corporation debuted three new items at the SEMA Show 2019 in November 2019. The company introduced a new auto-dimming mirror with an integrated HomeLink button that can operate via radio frequency and a cloud-based home automation system. As a result, the manufacture of cloud-based auto-dimming mirrors is expected to present significant potential prospects for market participants.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Report Scope<\/strong><\/p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width:825px; border-collapse:collapse ;\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Study Period<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">2019-2031<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">CAGR<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">5.1%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Historical Period<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">2019-2021<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Forecast Period<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">2023-2031<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Base Year<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">2022<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Base Year Market Size<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">USD 2,265.23 Million<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Forecast Year<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">2031<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Forecast Year Market Size<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">USD 3545.18 Million<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Largest Market<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Asia Pacific<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Fastest Growing Market<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Europe<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<p><b>Regional Analysis<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Asia-Pacific is the most significant\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=M-jAKdMmHqUGskORJDjEG31L4pgNGf5sSwfYn0yiommDOoj0qgxb-graQ8T1ljax3OJrUOeCxfaOpl8Vvo--KebTeOjOOQY8vtJhfLIyPu09Q4VrRMrd0-0qn7sRIry1sJ0qF7Bu0eAgS39nIaZR3P19sduAvKfHk1gbVWiayO8=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">global auto-dimming market shareholder<\/a> and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.31% over the forecast period.
