They observe how pollinators help the earth stay healthy, learn how to care for plants, and meet other critters that live in their garden, all while playfully shaping their bodies into yoga poses inspired by nature. Not only do Mama and her son learn valuable lessons about their garden, but along the way, they also learn to practice patience.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;By pairing lessons with movement, Rebecca Wheeler helps young readers make connections between the natural world and their own emotional experiences. Learn the value of patience and practice some fun yoga poses in this beautifully illustrated children\u2019s book.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Includes a step-by-step guide to each yoga pose!&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<\/p>\n<p>Rebecca Wenrich Wheeler was raised in West Point, a small town in the Tidewater region of Virginia. From the moment she submitted her first short story to a young author\u2019s contest in second grade, Rebecca knew she wanted to be a writer. Her love of writing led her to earn a BA in English and an MEd in English education. She spent several years as a high school teacher, during which she also developed a passion for mental health advocacy. Rebecca completed an MA in professional counseling and now works in the school-based mental health field and as a college adjunct psychology instructor.<\/p>\n<p>Rebecca also teaches yoga for the young and the young at heart, and she likes to infuse yoga and breathwork in her counseling practice wherever she can. She believes the most valuable use of her time is teaching youth how to love and care for each other and the world around them. Her stories share her focus on positive relationships and a love of nature.    <\/p>\n<p>Rebecca now lives in Durham, North Carolina, with her husband, two children, and two spoiled Siamese cats. &#8216;When Mama Grows with Me&#8217; is her second yoga-inspired picture book.   <\/p>\n<p>You can follow Rebecca on Instagram (@rebeccawwheeler_author) and Twitter (@RWW_author) and find her at her website, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.rebeccawwheeler.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.rebeccawwheeler.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>About the Illustrator<\/p>\n<p>Kate Jordan has done just about everything that has to do with art: drawing, painting, weaving, ceramics . . . even ink printing and bookbinding! But if you ask her what her favorite out of the bunch is, she\u2019ll easily say digital drawing. <\/p>\n<p>Brought up in a military family that moved around a lot, Kate lived an exciting childhood full of new places, new people, and new things. Now that she\u2019s older and out of school, she finds that she prefers a quieter life at home in Fredericksburg, Virginia, with her family. She hopes to one day write her own picture book to give to her children; but for now, she enjoys helping other people tell their stories with her beautiful, colorful art. She\u2019s happiest when she\u2019s drawing and listening to music, especially when she\u2019s nice and cozy under a mountain of blankets on a rainy day. <\/p>\n<p>You can see more of Kate\u2019s art in her DeviantArt gallery at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.deviantart.com\/rahkshi-miraka\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.deviantart.com\/rahkshi-miraka<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Interviews available upon request.<\/p>\n<p>Belle Isle Books, an imprint of Brandylane Publishers, Inc., is an independent press located in Richmond, Virginia that has published books since 1985.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n___________<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8216;When Mama Grows with Me&#8217; (hardcover, 32 pages, $25.95 \/ paperback, 32 pages, $14.95) is available from <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/When-Mama-Grows-Rebecca-Wheeler\/dp\/1958754641\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3A1IGXT2W908D&amp;keywords=when+mama+grows+with+me+rebecca+wheeler&amp;qid=1688563011&amp;sprefix=when+mama+grows+with+me+rebecca+wheeler%2Caps%2C83&amp;sr=8-1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Amazon<\/a>, Barnes &amp; Noble, and other fine booksellers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">PR Team<br \/>Brandylane Publishers, Inc.<br \/>804-644-3090<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/656393131\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BrandylanePublishers\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brandypublish\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/brandylane-publishers-inc.\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/brandylanepublishers\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=3mHCWk_ParuplQkI&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      September 20, 2023, 13:18 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/656393131\/explore-all-the-ways-plants-and-people-can-nourish-themselves-with-when-mama-grows-with-me\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
