The Axiom Business Book Awards are a respected guidepost for business books, intended to bring increased recognition to exemplary business books. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis book is a refreshing departure from traditional leadership literature,\u201d writes Chow Song Chee, Head of People at Ordinary Folk, in a review of the book that highlights the importance of Yeo\u2019s ability to tell powerful stories. \u201cShe delves into the deeper, more human aspects of leadership&#8230; Her insights resonate with readers (like me) on a personal level, challenging us to reflect on our own leadership style and values.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yeo credits <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.leadershipstorylab.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Leadership Story Lab<\/a>\u2019s Certified Story Facilitation (CSF) class with the success of the book. \u201cThe core principles from CSF sharpen my ability to think from the audience perspective,\u201d shared Yeo. \u201cWhile I was already attuned to my audience&#8217;s needs and pain points, applying the principles of curation to strategically evoke emotions made my stories even more compelling.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Yeo shared that she wrote a leadership story using Kung Fu Panda during the CSF class, and the workshopping helped refine it. This story was later incorporated into Leaders People Love, becoming one of the most resonant stories in the book. Using a well-liked movie helped Yeo create the perfect relatable example to reflect the inner struggles of many leaders.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMany seasoned leaders tell me my stories made them reflect deeper,\u201d said Yeo. \u201cOne even told me, he confronted his version of truth and challenged his operating principle all these years. This shows that storytelling, when done powerfully, can shift the most resistant minds.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Certified Story Facilitation course has been offered through Leadership Story Lab since 2020.
