Consumers worldwide have been seriously considering their fitness activities by indulging in various sports and fitness activities.<\/h2>\n<p>New York, United States, Nov.  29, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &#8212; Clothing that serves multiple purposes besides the wearer&#8217;s basic protection and aesthetic appeal is called functional clothing. Many different kinds of functional clothing are on the market, including athleisure wear, sportswear, medical wear, and others. Most consumers find activewear flexible and comfortable because of the material used to make such clothing or footwear. The most popular materials for athleisure apparel are synthetic fabrics like nylon and polyester because they provide the best balance of the necessary properties. Performance sportswear will continue to hold a larger value share even though athleisure is predicted to experience strong value sales growth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Download Free Sample Report PDF @\u00a0<\/strong><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=sSXYLXbUl_ri3olPAopIk4elFa-b0XfMxkkWUZqq34T9qhBsg0X8SjJ4bDmdK3U5PcWJ-XH0KJpA36-xmekeDEBaLQ-vvrqJrT1LiF52tHh7pt9eqri9AK-_nCoMcTM5TWqamyt0IgKKSM9U7jO_ShDlqewCvIsslNGTkvtK6oOdtay2dI2CWdDneQNXDlzyEwBBhIwVaz_KtAC4jxSHAq601apeOSiSUXD8RLrjxqA=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b><u>https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/functional-apparel-market\/request-sample<\/u><\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Extensive Advantages of Activewear Drives the Global Market<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Activewear is designed to help customers, particularly fitness and sports enthusiasts, perform better. Enhanced fabric breathability, wicking function, bi-stretch ability, and enhanced grip are major factors that boost users&#8217; performance and make activewear superior to other substitutes. On the other hand, anti-bacterial fabrics used in activewear reduce body odor and prevent the degradation of activewear color.<\/p>\n<p>Another significant benefit of activewear is thermal insulation. Despite the use of lightweight and thin fabric, thermal activewear aids in maintaining body temperature in adverse weather conditions. Some of the benefits of activewear include anti-static, quick-drying, and fabric elasticity, which increase the ease of care and maintenance of this clothing. As a result, the performance-enhancing, easy care and maintenance, and other benefits of activewear have fueled its global demand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Premiumization Trend Creates Tremendous Opportunities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Straits Research,\u00a0<i>&#8220;The global functional apparel market size was valued at\u00a0USD 318.83 billion in 2022. It is estimated to reach\u00a0USD 595.85 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of\u00a07.2%\u00a0during the forecast period (2023\u20132031).&#8221;<\/i>\u00a0Premiumization makes a brand or product more attractive to buyers by emphasizing its high quality and limited availability. It is driven by a desire to show success and a taste for high-quality goods. As per capita wealth rises, customers tend to choose higher-quality goods. Functional clothing is a premium product because it costs a lot and has features and specs that add worth. In addition, customers who can buy high-end goods are interested in these features. This is expected to increase the number of people who wear practical clothing, driving the market growth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Regional Analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=Xjf_g98bDFmxojQ_j6GCg8hMYmGx4rWbX9mGPmgtjxawd4RBdDLLFn9BGh922gZkLXGPiZKnzQho51TbCHYLxBc8mkXv-tfJKygQ7kVGj1lgfdN7EPt7xiKIzNOIIdJQimqdSkA71VsDj-fhagXWWYuoGkBwKNp5joCB01Vs9Lc=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>North America functional apparel market<\/u><\/a>\u00a0is estimated to exhibit a CAGR of 6.1% during the forecasted period.
