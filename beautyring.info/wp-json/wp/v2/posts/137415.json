(NYSE: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ticket-symbol\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#financial-modal\">CHH<\/a>) (&#8220;Choice&#8221;), on <span class=\"xn-chron\">November 14, 2023<\/span>. Wyndham&#8217;s Board of Directors, together with its financial and legal advisors, closely reviewed Choice&#8217;s letter and determined that it represents a step backwards and that the terms Choice outlined are not in the best interests of Wyndham or its shareholders. Wyndham responded to Choice in a letter dated <span class=\"xn-chron\">November 21, 2023<\/span>, included below.<br class=\"dnr\"><br class=\"dnr\">Choice&#8217;s first communication in a month since its public disclosure of its unsolicited proposal contains no change to the form of consideration and continues to undervalue\u00a0Wyndham&#8217;s standalone growth prospects. At Choice&#8217;s current share price, its offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Wyndham stands at a value of <span class=\"xn-money\">$86<\/span> per share[1], below the nominal value of <span class=\"xn-money\">$90<\/span> per share proposed on <span class=\"xn-chron\">October 17, 2023<\/span>, the date of Choice&#8217;s public disclosure. The letter proposes a two-year period for Choice to seek to obtain regulatory approvals supported only by a low 6% reverse termination fee, which would both create a prolonged period of limbo and expose\u00a0Wyndham and its shareholders to significant asymmetrical risk.<br class=\"dnr\"><br class=\"dnr\">Stephen\u00a0P. Holmes, Chairman of the Wyndham Board of Directors, said, &#8220;Choice continues to ignore our major concerns around value, consideration mix, and asymmetrical risk to our shareholders given the uncertainty around regulatory timeline and outcome. In addition, Choice&#8217;s existing proposal is valued at <span class=\"xn-money\">$86<\/span> per share, lower than the unsolicited public proposal of <span class=\"xn-money\">$90<\/span> per share they made a month ago. Given they now explicitly acknowledge the legitimate issues around the regulatory timeline, they are essentially asking our shareholders to take on serious risk and accept as compensation for a failed deal a low reverse termination fee that doesn&#8217;t even begin to compensate for the potential lost earnings and long-term impairment to value that could occur during an uncertain two-year regulatory review. In line with our fiduciary duties, we will of course always evaluate any serious proposal, but Choice continues to fail to adequately address any of the three core issues we have repeatedly raised. They have instead chosen to prolong this for months with a proposal that remains unfeasible, damaging to our business, and unnecessarily distracting to our management team.&#8221;<br class=\"dnr\"><br
