But he brought out the very best in our nation, from the simplicity and wholesomeness of rural living to urbane modernity, faith and family values, and a bright future in the land of the free.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Byrne says the documentary is inspired in part by his friend <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/sthaggerty.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">S.T. Haggerty\u2019s book, Norman Rockwell&#8217;s Models: In and Out of the Studio<\/a>. (Rowan &amp; Littlefield Publishers 2023.) Byrne has published interviews with Rockwell\u2019s son, Jarvis, Rockwell model, Pauline Grimes, as well as with Haggerty himself who spent long summers at his family\u2019s farmhouse near West Arlington, Vermont. (Norman Rockwell once had his home and studio here.) Haggerty grew up knowing many local Rockwell models in West Arlington, including those who posed for such famous works as Freedom of Speech, Breaking Home Ties, and Girl at the Mirror.<\/p>\n<p>Byrne also says the documentary is \u201cperfect for a corporate sponsor who wants to reframe the American consumer narrative, in a profoundly positive way that harkens back to the ideals that sustained America in the best and worst of times.\u201d The impetus for the documentary is also propelled by new research on the American Dream, as well as his alarm at increasing polarization in US society, according to Byrne <\/p>\n<p>An exhaustive study earlier this year by the Archbridge Institute and the University of Chicago on the American Dream, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nypost.com\/2023\/07\/04\/the-american-dream-is-becoming-increasingly-out-of-reach-poll\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">as reported by the New York Post<\/a>,  concluded that while the results, \u201ccontinue to show large agreement and optimism across Americans of diverse age, race\/ethnicity, education and income groups, there are signs of declining belief in the United States as the \u2018land of opportunity.\u2019\u201d <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWow, what\u2019s that all about?\u201d Byrne asks, incredulously. So if you think the America Dream is dead, think again, he says. In truth, he adds, it is about perception and reality. And Byrne thinks a new documentary on Rockwell, spanning the artist\u2019s career, examining Rockwell\u2019s vision of America, and in the eyes of his models (many still alive), and the author ST Haggerty, would be a cathartic moment for America.  <\/p>\n<p>A decline in belief in the American Dream, defined by factors such as an ability to live in freedom and retire comfortably, own a home and raise a family, has risen lately as more Americans are crushed by rising prices, lack of affordable housing, and fears about crime and personal safety. <\/p>\n<p>Still, the Archbridge Institute survey with the University of Chicago released this past summer noted, nonetheless, that 75% of Americans \u2014 across all ages, race, income or education \u2014 admitted they have either achieved the American Dream, or are on the path to achieving it. <\/p>\n<p>Byrne says notions that the American Dream as an achievable goal, is in sharp decline, are often fueled by poorly informed, or biased media and culture warriors \u2014 sometimes by pundits who do not believe in the great American ideal envisaged by the Founding Fathers. Norman Rockwell celebrated the American Dream across many decades, says Byrne, in wartime and in peace time, in good times and bad, capturing the essential nature of the nation, a spirit of can-do optimism and unity. <\/p>\n<p>Byrne quotes Don Feder, who recently wrote in the Washington Times of how Rockwell\u2019s art gave us hope. \u201cWe need that more than ever today,\u201d says Byrne.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe celebrated life in a simpler time \u2014 backyard ball games, prom dates, boys dreaming they\u2019ll grow up to become firemen, a child goggle-eyed when he discovers a Santa hat and false beard in his father\u2019s dresser. Middle America took him to heart. The snob-elite disdained him,\u201d according to Feder.<\/p>\n<p>Added Feder: \u201cRockwell had the last laugh. He painted the official portraits of five presidents. His Four Freedoms, painted in 1943, raised $132 million in war bond sales when it toured the country on exhibit. In 2013, one of his paintings sold at auction for $46 million.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Says Byrne: \u201cOur documentary will celebrate the sophistication, beauty and simplicity, as well as the contradictions of America, but also its great advances, and its hugely extensive technical and technological innovations you won\u2019t find in any other parts of the world. Rockwell projects and honors this landscape and spirit of can-do and enterprise.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About John Aidan Byrne<\/p>\n<p>John Aidan Byrne, a multi-media expert who runs his own boutique communications company for print and video productions, is a dual US and Irish citizen who came to America from his native Ireland over three decades ago.<\/p>\n<p>Byrne is a contributor and writer for numerous publications and outlets, including the New York Post, Wall Street Journal, National Catholic Register.
