This growth is due to the implementation of strategies from multiple governments worldwide. Furthermore, the high demand for vacation rental properties is increasing due to the increasing number of tourists. \u00a0Baby boomers are also another factor in the growth of the tourism sector, as compared to long-term rental properties. Short-term rental properties bring increased returns if they are marketed properly. The advantages, such as increased comfort and affordability, attract consumers to such spaces. Hence, these factors are expected to drive the growth of the market during the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p><b>Major Trends<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>The adoption of effective promotional strategies is the major trend shaping the vacation rental market growth.<\/b>\u00a0The primary factor is the market advertising strategies that various vendors adopt along with celebrity endorsements. As a result, it helps them to expand their customer base. Discounts, seasonal offers, and contests are being offered by vendors on various services. The increased internet usage is the primary factor for the increased potential of major vendors in the market. Most of the vendors have a significant online presence, that helps them to target various customers with online strategies such as social media campaigns and promotional strategies. The popularity of social networking has contributed to increased investments in these strategies. Hence, the above-mentioned factors are expected to significantly change customer perception in the vacation rental market.<\/p>\n<p><b>Significant Challenges<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Risks associated with fraudulent vacation rental houses, apartments, and homestays are the significant challenge restricting the market growth.<\/b> The various misconducts such as Scams, fraudulent reviews, and unethical dealings are primary factors restricting the market. Due to this, customers mistrust some vendors. Airbnb Inc and HomeAway provide user reviews and ratings for the customers to help them find the best service. The increased percentage of risks can lead to customers changing their opinion about the service and shifting to alternative forms of lodging, such as hotels. Hence, these factors are expected to restrain the growth of the market during the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntac\"><i><b>For more details and an understanding of Market Dynamics,\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.technavio.com\/talk-to-us?report=IRTNTR72059&amp;type=sample&amp;rfs=epd&amp;src=report&amp;utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=auto_v7_wk44_2023_019_IPBus_rfs5&amp;utm_content=IRTNTR72059\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">download Sample reports<\/a><\/b><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>Vacation Rental Market 2023-2027: Segmentation<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The vacation Rental Market is segmented as below:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Management<\/li>\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>Managed by owners.<\/li>\n<li>Professionally managed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Mode Of Booking\u00a0<\/li>\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li>Offline<\/li>\n<li>Online<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Geography\u00a0<\/li>\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li><span class=\"xn-location\">Europe<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"xn-location\">North America<\/span><\/li>\n<li>APAC<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"xn-location\">Middle East<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Africa<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span class=\"xn-location\">South America<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The market share growth of the <b>managed-by-owners segment<\/b> will be significant during the forecast period.
