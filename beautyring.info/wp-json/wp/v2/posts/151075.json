Many of the exit scammers are well-practiced in their abilities to defraud unsuspecting customers. When opportunities appear &#8216;too good to be true,&#8217; it&#8217;s often because they are,&#8221; according to a <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4163316-1&amp;h=4196002701&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fbi.gov%2Fcontact-us%2Ffield-offices%2Fnewyork%2Fnews%2Ffbi-new-york-warns-of-scams-targeting-timeshare-owners&amp;a=January+press+release\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">January press release<\/a> from the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. &#8220;Be sure to use caution when dealing with anyone who expresses interest in your timeshare. If you think you have been targeted by a timeshare scam, please report the incident.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Many of these companies guarantee that they can cancel a timeshare, sometimes deceptively calling what they do &#8220;consumer advocacy.&#8221; Typically, this is nothing more than preparing or sending formulaic, and often fabricated, letters of complaint to timeshare developers, the Better Business Bureau, or federal, state or local governmental or regulatory bodies. But, as these companies know, those letters will not result in the cancellation of a timeshare. Instead, they must induce timeshare owners to stop paying their timeshare obligations all while lining their own pockets with the exorbitant upfront fee they charge the timeshare owners.<\/p>\n<p>Capital Vacations is fighting exit companies&#8217; exploitation of Capital Vacations&#8217; members. It has filed lawsuits against Financial Recovery Advocates, LLC (&#8220;FRA&#8221;) and associated businesses. FRA is an exit company that has cynically adopted the &#8220;consumer advocacy&#8221; business model. Capital Vacations also asserts claims against <span class=\"xn-person\">Robert Grosser<\/span>, who is one of FRA&#8217;s representatives who is responsible for sending many of the boilerplate letters, Valuation\u00a0<span>Fraud<\/span> &amp; Forensics, LLC, and its principal <span class=\"xn-person\">Jaclyn Burket Franks<\/span>, and Bottom Line Accounting and Tax Services, LLC and its principal <span class=\"xn-person\">Carmen Wallace<\/span>. These last two businesses and individuals prepare cookie-cutter reports that, without evidence, conclude that the timeshare owner has been subjected to misrepresentation. These reports are all identical, and, like FRA&#8217;s conduct, do not cancel Capital Vacations&#8217; member&#8217;s timeshare. The reports are only intended to give FRA&#8217;s customers the impression that FRA is doing something to bring about the cancellation of a timeshare when they are not.<\/p>\n<p>Capital Vacations has\u00a0<span>alleged<\/span> that FRA and its associates have engaged in deceptive and unfair acts or practices in violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. The lawsuit is pending in the <span class=\"xn-location\">South Carolina<\/span>, 15<sup>th<\/sup> Judicial Circuit, along with an action in the State Supreme Court seeking declaratory relief, asking a court to find FRA is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about how to avoid\u00a0<span>fraud<\/span> in these situations, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4163316-1&amp;h=2260812933&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arda.org%2Faarp-how-you-can-avoid-fraud-when-exiting-your-timeshare&amp;a=ARDA.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">ARDA.org<\/a>.
