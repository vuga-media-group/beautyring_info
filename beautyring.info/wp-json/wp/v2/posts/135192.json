The selection includes a newly restored copy of the 1988 classic crime drama &#8220;Mapantsula&#8221; directed by Oliver Schmitz, &#8220;Marigolds in August&#8221; by Ross Devenish, a drama based on the play &#8220;Marigolds in August\u201d written by Athol Fugard, who in the early 1980s was South Africa\u2019s most celebrated playwright, and Nothing But the Truth written and directed by acclaimed South African actor-director John Kani.<\/p>\n<p>ADIFF 2023 will present four Egyptian films that feature women both in front of and behind the camera.
