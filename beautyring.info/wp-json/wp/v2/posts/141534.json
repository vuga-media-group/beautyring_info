About 50% of Americans will develop cataracts by age 75, a percentage that is projected to increase as life expectancies continue to rise. Cataracts form when the proteins and fibers in the eye\u2019s natural lens begin to break down, causing hazy or cloudy vision.<\/p>\n<p>Once begun, cataracts only worsen until surgery is necessary. During surgery, a patient\u2019s natural lens is removed and replaced with a clear synthetic one. Until now, surgeons relied upon the accuracy of pre-surgery measurements to determine a patient\u2019s post-operative prescription power. RxSight\u2019s Light Adjustable Lens is changing that with the ability to customize vision after surgery. Studies show that patients who receive the LAL and the recommended post-surgery treatments were more likely to achieve 20\/20 vision or better without glasses compared to cataract patients who have standard lens implants. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.accessdata.fda.gov\/cdrh_docs\/pdf16\/P160055B.pdf\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.accessdata.fda.gov\/cdrh_docs\/pdf16\/P160055B.pdf<\/a> The LAL is made of proprietary material that can be adjusted post-surgery using the RxSight Light Delivery Device to deliver targeted ultraviolet light treatments. The LAL can be adjusted to meet every patient\u2019s lifestyle and needs. \u201cSmall variations happen in most eyes during healing. With the LAL, cataract patients can test drive their vision and we can post-operatively correct those variations and give patients vision that is customized for their specific needs,\u201d said Dr. Patel. <\/p>\n<p>About Dr. Reena Patel:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nReena Patel M.D. is a board-certified ophthalmologist who founded Wichita Vision Institute in 2004.
