Their childhood wasn&#8217;t just about toys and games &#8212; it was a mission to uphold the nation&#8217;s defense and intensely purpose-driven.<\/p>\n<p>The experiences of military children have been a much-overlooked aspect of military service. But now, a recently released new memoir helps fill this major gap, offering an essential account of this unique perspective of the U.S. military.<\/p>\n<p>In <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Army-Brat-World-War-II\/dp\/1662944462\/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">ARMY BRAT<\/a>: World War II, debut author Laura Gutman describes her life deeply embedded within the world of the Armed Forces from the United States\u2019 earliest entry into World War II through the Vietnam era. Witnessing and chronicling pivotal events during those years, this historical autobiography describes the reality of a child\u2019s life that was inextricably intertwined with the military.<\/p>\n<p>Her family was often posted to stations that experienced events of deep historical consequences. Her backyard in Hawaii, for example, abutted Wheeler Airfield, where she was witness to the attack on Pearl Harbor. <\/p>\n<p>In immediate post-war Germany, the family experienced life under extensive Russian hostility and threats, and the Berlin of the airlift era.  Because her father, a mid-level officer, was the liaison to the Army during the crafting of defense protocols, she often overheard important conversations with Senators and Generals in her German home.<\/p>\n<p>As her father achieved many military honors, Laura\u2019s childhood was one of intense awareness of the dangers he faced and the courage her mother displayed. She could feel her mother\u2019s anxiety and pain opening several telegrams informing that her father had been wounded.<\/p>\n<p>By the time she finished high school, she had lived in 20 homes and schools, each move bringing about the loss of friends and attachments.<\/p>\n<p>Through the constant upheaval and disruption so familiar to military families, Laura developed a radical independence, a determination to gain control over her life, and a fearless approach to her own education.<\/p>\n<p>Chronicling the experiences of a strong military family as they witness and participate in the unfolding of history in a dangerous and challenging world, ARMY BRAT provides consequential insights into the critical importance of a strong religious foundation, an educational system dedicated to core concepts of nation and loyalty, and leadership that prioritizes sovereignty, national defense, and military support.<\/p>\n<p>The book is already receiving much praise.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cARMY BRAT takes us on her fascinating journey of \u201cgrowing up Army.\u201d If you want to know what it really means to serve America at home and abroad, both in and out of uniform, this is the inside scoop from a woman who knows the deal.
