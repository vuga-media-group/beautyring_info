During the Labor Day holiday, its homestay sector operated by Chengtu Home (&#8220;Chengtu&#8221;) recorded an impressive average daily occupancy rate of 95%, achieving a significant year-on-year growth of 265%.<\/p>\n<p>As\u00a0a leading bed and breakfast (&#8220;B&amp;B&#8221;) brand in the country, Chengtu exceeded <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB12 million<\/span> in sales revenue during the Labor Day Holiday. Cities covered by Chengtu, ranging from tier-one to tier-four, experienced full bookings, and popular tourist destinations in these cities achieved an impressive 100% occupancy rate.<\/p>\n<p>In April, Chengtu introduced a specialized housing operation management plan in anticipation of the surge in housing reservations during the upcoming holiday season. Among other things, Chengtu provided a timely reminder to both agents and landlords to adjust housing prices one month prior to the holiday, ensuring they align with market conditions and reduce risks associated with industry competition. In doing so, Chengtu aimed to boost housing revenues while safeguarding consumer rights.<\/p>\n<p>Drawing on its extensive experience in homestay management and deep understanding of user travel patterns, Chengtu capitalized on its expertise to effectively adjust homestay prices during the holiday season, aiming to reduce the number of vacant properties. Chengtu recognized the potential risk of unsold accommodations on the day before and the last day of the holiday and took\u00a0proactive measures to inform homestay agents about the need to lower\u00a0their prices.<\/p>\n<p>By implementing this proactive approach, Chengtu generated a greater number of pre-sales opportunities, leading to increased business volume while protecting the interests of homestay landlords. Through strategic price adjustments, Chengtu ensured optimal occupancy rates, enabling homestay operators to maximize their revenue potential during the holiday season.<\/p>\n<p>Chengtu implemented a series of initiatives aimed at enhancing guest satisfaction, including requiring landlords to complete check-in procedures for the next day&#8217;s bookings during the reception period to ensure a seamless check-in process for guests. In addition, Chengtu allocated a flexible workforce pool from Quhuo to coordinate the homestay cleaning team, and conducted special meetings to emphasize the importance of quality and timely cleaning services. These measures have effectively improved cleaning efficiency. For example, in Nanning City, <span class=\"xn-location\">Guangxi Province<\/span>, Chengtu received over 2,000 bookings during the holiday and achieved an almost 100% positive feedback rating.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, prior to the holiday, Chengtu made a commitment on various prominent agency platforms, assuring that its homestays would refrain from unjustified price hikes or violating agreements during the holiday. This commitment was aimed at protecting consumers&#8217; rights. Meituan has recognized and acknowledged this commitment, which has contributed to enhancing the credibility and reputation of Quhuo. This initiative by Chengtu signifies a notable advancement in user experience and serves as a competitive market differentiation strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Tong Ji, the General Manager of Chengtu, said that Chengtu has a highly skilled team proficient in managing all aspects of hospitality and operations. Chengtu deligently refines\u00a0and optimizes\u00a0each stage, from customer reservations to the lodging experience and post-departure services. Through precise market research and data analysis, Chengtu is able to offer consumers the most suitable accommodation options at competitive rates, ensuring personalized and highly satisfactory service.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Leslie Yu<\/span>, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Quhuo, said, &#8220;The impressive achievements of Chengtu&#8217;s vacation rentals during the holiday serve as a testament to the value of our strategic planning and operational management in localized life services. The resurgence of the tourism industry reaffirms our steadfast belief in vacation rentals as a crucial strategic segment within Quhuo. Moving forward, Chengtu will further increase investments in lean operational management, continually innovating and optimizing its business models to adapt to the rapidly changing landscape of the tourism sector and the diverse demands of clientele.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>About Quhuo Limited<\/p>\n<p>Quhuo Limited (NASDAQ: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ticket-symbol\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#financial-modal\"><\/a><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/quhuo-announces-official-launch-of-quhuo-international-providing-tech-enabled-operational-solutions-to-global-partners-301739020.html#financial-modal\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">QH<\/a>) (&#8220;Quhuo&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a leading gig economy platform focusing on local life services in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span>.
