Davis, and the indomitable spirit of activist Bree Newsome Bass, this collection sheds light on the harsh realities of our carceral system while paving a vision for systemic reform. Each essay is bolstered by a comprehensive reader&#8217;s guide to deepen the reader&#8217;s understanding and foster discussion. <\/p>\n<p>In its review, Booklist writes, \u201cThis collection is certain to be an invaluable organizing tool, hopefully leading to widespread change.\u201d Barbara Smith, the co-founder of the Combahee River Collective, adds to the accolades, observing that, \u201cCarefully curated, incisively conceptualized anthologies like Alain Locke&#8217;s &#8216;The New Negro&#8217; and Toni Cade Bambara&#8217;s &#8216;The Black Woman&#8217; can transform worlds. &#8216;Abolition for the People&#8217; stands tall in this revered tradition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Aligning with their commitment to widespread access and education and recognizing the power of knowledge in challenging and reshaping oppressive structures, Kaepernick Publishing and Haymarket Books are proud to announce the #BooksAreWeapons Initiative for this paperback release. They will be donating 10,000 paperback copies to organizations supporting incarcerated individuals and those reintegrating post-incarceration. <\/p>\n<p>In many prisons, the dubious classification of hardcovers as &#8220;weapons&#8221; bars the incarcerated from access to invaluable knowledge. Responding to this deprivation and acknowledging the interlocking violences of the prison system, the publishers firmly believe in knowledge as a catalyst for self-preservation, freedom, and liberation. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Abolition for the People&#8221; is slated for its official release on September 5, 2023. <\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE EDITOR<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nColin Kaepernick holds the all-time NFL record for most rushing yards in a game by a quarterback. The Super Bowl QB took a knee during the playing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d in 2016 to bring attention to systemic oppressions, specifically police terrorism against Black and Brown people. For his stance, he has been denied employment by the league. Since 2016, he has founded and helped to fund three organizations\u2014Know Your Rights Camp, Ra Vision Media, and Kaepernick Publishing\u2014that together advance the liberation of Black and Brown people through storytelling, systems change, and political education. Kaepernick sits on Medium\u2019s board and is the winner of numerous prestigious honors including Amnesty International\u2019s Ambassador of Conscience Award, the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Ripple of Hope honor, GQ magazine\u2019s Citizen of the Year, the NFL\u2019s Len Eshmont Award, the &#8220;Sports Illustrated&#8221; Muhammad Ali Legacy Award, the ACLU\u2019s Eason Monroe Courageous Advocate Award, and the Puffin\/Nation Institute\u2019s Prize for Creative Citizenship. In 2019, Kaepernick helped Nike win an Emmy for its \u201cDream Crazy\u201d commercial.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE PUBLISHERS<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nKaepernick Publishing and Haymarket Books have been at the forefront of publishing pivotal works that resonate deeply with societal challenges and aspirations. Their combined efforts aim to foster impactful dialogues and contribute towards building a future infused with equity and justice.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Nanda Dyssou<br \/>Coriolis Company<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/651176993\/tel:+1 424-226-6148\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">+1 424-226-6148<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/651176993\/mailto:nanda@corioliscompany.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">nanda@corioliscompany.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=nPO3Lf_BPJ-YckHx&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      August 22, 2023, 15:05 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/651176993\/voices-for-a-world-without-bars-abolition-for-the-people-debuts-in-paperback\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
