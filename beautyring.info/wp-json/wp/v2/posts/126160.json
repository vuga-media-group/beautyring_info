Diversity Week promotes celebration, education, and understanding of diversity and inclusion and the various cultures existent within the Company.\u00a0Daily activities across <span class=\"xn-location\">North America<\/span> occurred over a one-week period in August and highlighted the Company&#8217;s three diversity focus areas: Workplace, Marketplace, and Community. The Company continues to invest in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Recruitment Initiative, which builds partnerships with HBCUs that have hospitality and tourism programs. Through campus visits and targeted engagement, the program created awareness of employment opportunities with Wynn Resorts and welcomed its first cohort of graduates into the HBCU Management Training Program. In 2022, Wynn was recognized on Forbes&#8217; list of &#8220;Best Employers For Diversity&#8221;, ranking in the top 12 companies in the Travel and Leisure category.<\/li>\n<li><b>Employee volunteerism doubled in 2022<\/b>, compared to the previous year.
