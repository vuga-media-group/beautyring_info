In 2006, the US government designated the area the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor, providing funds to help the Gullah Geechee preserve historic Lowcountry sites with the assistance of the US National Park Service. The government\u2019s Act recognized the Gullah people\u2019s success in maintaining the resilient cultural traditions of their West African ancestors, including not only their unique African-based creole language\u2014the only one of its kind in the US, and one not unlike the patois of their cousins in the diaspora who were brought to Jamaica\u2014but also their crafts, religious rituals, and foodways. Daise served as chairman of the GGCHCC during the launch of the Corridor\u2019s Management Plan.<\/p>\n<p>In &#8216;Raptors in the Ricelands,&#8217; Gullah Geechee native\u2014or, in Gullah Geechee terms, \u201cbeenyah\u201d\u2014Ron Daise shines a light on a fictional Gullah Geechee community in Georgetown, SC, the lives of its residents\u2014and the motives of those people who would take advantage of them. Told in vignettes spanning six decades from 1960 to the modern day, his nonlinear four-part tale interweaves accounts of true historical events alongside the trials and heartbreaks faced by both beenyahs and comeyahs\u2014outsiders who have moved to historic Gullah Geechee ricelands, communities near former rice fields where rice heritage thrives: <\/p>\n<p>Chadwick Wineglass is a beenyah who, thanks to his parents\u2019 tutelage, has always been acutely aware of how white people perceive his people\u2019s unique, rhythmic speech. A visionary and entrepreneur, he dreams of economic success that will allow him to enrich his neighbors\u2014but finds his good intentions marred by the insidiously attractive promises of investors who would profit at the expense of his community, as well as by his own raptor-like views of how best to practice philanthropy.<\/p>\n<p>Florence Wineglass, Chadwick\u2019s wife, grapples with infertility and the revelation of her grandfather\u2019s infidelity as her marriage begins to suffer. <\/p>\n<p>Thelma Marshel, a comeyah, wrestles with her unfamiliarity with her new husband\u2019s Gullah culture, and struggles with her own controlling nature as she attempts to maintain their relationship.<\/p>\n<p>Thelma\u2019s brother Timothy Thunderbolt, a comeyah and fervent pastor who struggles to reconcile his staunch Christian views with the traditional beliefs and healing also practiced in the community to which he now preaches, learns the beauty of Gullah Geechee spirituality. Meanwhile, his wife, Sibyl Thunderbolt, a comeyah with Native American heritage, finds a familial connection in her and Timothy\u2019s new church community.<\/p>\n<p>These are only a few of the richly detailed characters who people the Lowcountry of Daise\u2019s novel\u2014a novel that challenges even as it educates, examining such questions as the true extent of a benefactor\u2019s obligation, how a Christian church and its leaders can best inspire a community, the means by which families are tied together, and the ways the pains suffered by a people can linger in their descendants\u2019 bodies and present conflicts. And throughout, Daise brings his expertise as a member of the team that translated the language for the Gullah Bible to bear as he lovingly crafts passages rich with the Gullah accent, as well as Gullah customs, beliefs, and lifestyles. <\/p>\n<p>A thought-provoking, poetic, poignantly emotional saga for beenyahs, comeyahs, and those who have never set foot in South Carolina\u2019s Lowcountry, &#8216;Raptors in the Ricelands&#8217; is scheduled for release on April 30, 2024.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;In a fictional twenty-first century version of the community of Georgetown, SC, a story unfolds revealing family secrets and conflicts that challenge cultural beliefs. With bighearted intention, newlyweds Florence and Chadwick Wineglass attempt to promote economic legacy, but their unconscious motives often ensnare those they assist. The Wineglasses become raptor-like in their generosity at a moment when other community members\u2019 intentions also prove to be menacing.<\/p>\n<p>Conveyed in four acts and with chapter names that follow the production stages of Carolina Gold Rice, &#8220;Raptors in the Ricelands&#8221; spans the future, the present, and the past, and fosters a message of connection with African diasporic communities around the globe. Historical accounts include the Orangeburg Massacre; Black church life, particularly in Oconee County, SC as begun during slavery; the launch of White supremacy in Fort Mill, SC; the Reconstruction Era; and the Universal Negro Improvement Association.&#8217;\t<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;About the Author&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Ron Daise, a son of St. Helena Island, SC, is an author, performer, educator, and cultural interpreter whose books, productions, and recordings have documented and shaped Gullah Geechee heritage since 1986.
