Body treatments may include body wraps, Vichy showers, and aromatherapy. Also, hair spa treatments can address various issues such as hair loss, dandruff, and color-treated hair. The demand for these treatments is increasing. Additionally,\u00a0innovative body spa treatments, such as hot stone massages, are being offered by vendors to cater to the needs of customers.<\/p>\n<p><b>The competition from beauty salons and a lack of skilled labor\u00a0are major challenges impeding the spa services market.\u00a0<\/b>Salons and spa centers are facing this challenge because spa administrators and other professionals are not properly trained and most spa companies limit their investments in resources and lack the necessary efforts to conduct training workshops, courses, and other professional development activities for their staff. This further makes it difficult for owners to find professional and qualified therapists. Furthermore, there is also a shortage of skilled labor in the market due to the lack of proper academics and training for students pursuing careers in the spa industry. Hence, such challenges hinder the market growth during the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p><b>Key Trends<\/b>&#8211;<\/p>\n<p><b>An increase in the availability of flotation therapy spa services\u00a0is a key trend influencing\u00a0the\u00a0spa services market industry.<\/b>\u00a0The concept of levitation therapy is based on the elimination of gravity, which\u00a0is increasing with the increased use of spa weightlessness, seawater, stress, and mind-melting flotation tanks, rooms, and pools. Furthermore, it has several medicinal benefits, including treating blood pressure and energizing the body, regulating blood circulation, and improving skin. The water and air temperatures are kept within a specific range that is neutral to the skin, during the treatment. This therapy uses a special floating tank that is dark and soundproof. Hence, such trends fuel the growth of the market during the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntac\"><b>Technavio has identified key trends, drivers, and challenges in the market, which will help clients improve their strategies to stay ahead of their competitors- <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.technavio.com\/talk-to-us?report=IRTNTR44687&amp;type=sample&amp;rfs=epd&amp;src=report_sticky&amp;utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=t47reg_wk19_2023_016_rfs2&amp;utm_content=IRTNTR44687\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">View Sample Report<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Company Profiles<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The spa market report includes information on the product launches, sustainability, and prospects of leading vendors including Cal A Vie Health Spa, Clinique La Prairie, CR Operating LLC, Four Seasons Hotels Ltd., Gaia Retreat and Spa, Grand Resort Bad Ragaz AG, Hand and Stone Franchise Corp., Harrison Hot Springs Resort Inc., HOT SPRINGS RESORT and SPA, Hyatt Hotels Corp., InterContinental Hotels Group PLC, <span class=\"xn-person\">Jade Mountain<\/span>, Kempinski Hotels SA, Lakehilll Springs Pty Ltd., Lanserhof Management GmbH, Marriott International Inc., Muse Salon and Spa, Rancho La Puerta Inc., Woodhouse Spa, and Young Medical Spa.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntac\"><b>To provide a deeper understanding of the competitive landscape, Technavio has profiled key players along with the study that categorizes the global market segmentation, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.technavio.com\/talk-to-us?report=IRTNTR44687&amp;type=sample&amp;rfs=epd&amp;src=report_sticky&amp;utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=t47reg_wk19_2023_016_rfs3&amp;utm_content=IRTNTR44687\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">request a sample report!<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Spa Market &#8211; Competitive Analysis<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The report includes competitive analysis, a proprietary tool to analyze and evaluate the position of companies based on their industry position score and market performance score.
