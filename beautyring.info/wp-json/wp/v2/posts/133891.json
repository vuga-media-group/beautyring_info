In addition, a rise in foreign direct investment (FDI) has contributed to the production of high-value crops. Customers are reporting a high demand for new biological products such as bio nematicides to use against nematodes on standing crops. Nematodes are the cause of crop damages, which in turn reduces the overall farm yield and quality. Customers are seeing a high demand for these new biological products. The application of similar biological and alternative management products is becoming more common.<\/p>\n<p><b>Regional Analysis<\/b><\/p>\n<p>North America is the largest shareholder and is anticipated to dominate the global nematicides market.
