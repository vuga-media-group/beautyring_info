A character who looked different from everyone around him. He was a target for bullying.<\/p>\n<p>That idea not only launched an award-winning book series and films featuring Junga the Dancing Yeti<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>, but propelled its author, Stephen Tako, and his collaborators to create a non-profit organization to develop the &#8220;Confident Life&#8221; anti-bullying program for kids.<\/p>\n<p>Motivated To Act Launched its newest film in true California fashion \u2013 with the audience walking the red carpet, enjoying complimentary refreshments, networking with creators and educators, and enjoying the World Premiere of the new Junga the Dancing Yeti<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> short film, \u201cYeti, Set, Go!\u201d at the UC San Diego Faculty Club, in La Jolla.<\/p>\n<p>Watch movie trailer here: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=K2Gtl7lImvM\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=K2Gtl7lImvM<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cYeti Set Go!\u201d is a football-based film featuring the voices of five former NFL players: Brian Sipe, Dave DesRochers, Brett Faryniarz, Marques Ogden and J.R. Tolver. The film takes place on the mountain on which Junga lives and is the location of a popular football game. The game sheds light on respecting others on and off the field and helps children understand the importance of sportsmanship and of treating others with kindness.<\/p>\n<p>Ward Leber, CEO &amp; Founder of the Child Safety Network (\u201cCSN\u201d) placed Stephen Tako on CSN\u2019s professional advisory board last year as a subject matter expert on antibullying.  Among other volunteer efforts for CSN, Stephen testified before the Colorado State committees on Education in both the House and Senate last year; with a dozen other nationally recognized CSN Senior Advisors who are experts on student, campus and school bus safety and security.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe San Diego Cooperative Charter School has agreed to pilot the Confident Life program this year for K-3rd grades. Once the program is fully vetted with measurable goals attained, we will open the program on a national and then international level.&#8221; &#8211; Said Tako<\/p>\n<p>Event Sponsors included: Child Safety Network, Rezilir Health, Harmony Mama Law, Christy White &amp; Associates, ATS Wealth Management, Cigma Media, JYT LAW, Gary Spatz&#8217;s The Playground, La Jolla Golden Triangle Rotary Club, The 1st &amp; Goal Project, Li Zhang and Family, Nancy Gatschet, Jennifer Jeffries, Dianne Day &amp; Brad Nemeth, Chris &amp; Keith Muhart, Vinestreet Entertainment Consulting, Paraskevi<\/p>\n<p>MTA is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization and will provide donation receipts upon request.
