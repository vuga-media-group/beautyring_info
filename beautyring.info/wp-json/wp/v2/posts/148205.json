I&#8217;m thankful to each of them for their help in initiating this LA Chapter and participating on the Board. As a center of culture and entertainment, <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles<\/span> is a trendsetter in delivering luxury travel experiences.\u00a0 It&#8217;s terrific to have the opportunity to launch a forum where thought leaders of the industry can exchange ideas, share knowledge, and build connections. As a business leader at HVS, a firm that focuses exclusively on delivering comprehensive services to the hospitality industry, inaugurating this ILHA chapter is a perfect fit,&#8221; commented <span class=\"xn-person\">Marcus Lee<\/span>, Executive Vice President, HVS.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Barak Hirschowitz<\/span>, President of the ILHA, opened the meeting by introducing the organization, its origins, evolution, and the invaluable role it plays in the luxury hotel industry.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With great pleasure, I welcome you all to our inaugural <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles<\/span> chapter meeting of the International Luxury Hotel Association,&#8221; Barak began. &#8220;Before we dive into the specifics, let me take a moment to provide some context about the ILHA and its journey thus far.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He recounted the organization&#8217;s humble beginnings in 2006, conceived as a forum\u2014a term that might evoke nostalgia for those who remembered the era before the dominance of social media. &#8220;Our founding board members, including luminaries like <span class=\"xn-person\">Peter Gassner<\/span> of <span class=\"xn-person\">Marriott and Alex Sogno<\/span> of Global Asset Solutions, laid the groundwork for what would become a global hub for luxury hotel professionals,&#8221; Barak continued, nodding to the pivotal role played by individuals like <span class=\"xn-person\">Allison Sitch<\/span>, formerly of Ritz Carlton.<\/p>\n<p>Highlighting the unique niche the ILHA filled, Barak emphasized how traditional education and industry associations often fell short in addressing the rapidly evolving landscape of luxury hospitality. &#8220;Luxury is not static; it&#8217;s dynamic, ever-evolving,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;As the industry underwent seismic shifts\u2014from the rise of design hotels to the globalization of travel\u2014we recognized the need for a platform where professionals could exchange ideas, share insights, and navigate the complexities of this sector.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Barak traced the ILHA&#8217;s journey from its online forum roots to its current status as a non-profit association boasting over half a million followers globally. &#8220;Our growth has been nothing short of remarkable,&#8221; he stated proudly. &#8220;From humble online beginnings to hosting over 50 events annually, both in-person and virtual, the ILHA has cemented its position as a beacon of excellence in the luxury hospitality realm.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Barak outlined the array of offerings and initiatives spearheaded by the ILHA\u2014including advisory groups, committee meetings, webinars, and prestigious conferences. &#8220;We are not merely an association; we are a community\u2014a network of leaders, innovators, and visionaries committed to driving excellence in luxury hospitality,&#8221; he declared, his words resonating with conviction.<\/p>\n<p>Following Barak&#8217;s introduction, the members of the ILHA&#8217;s <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles<\/span> chapter board took turns introducing themselves, offering a glimpse into their roles and interests within the luxury hospitality sector.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Erik Eveleigh<\/span>, Vice President of Development for the Americas at SH Hotels and Resorts, expressed his excitement for organizations promoting luxury travel and development.

He is particularly excited about projects like their upcoming hotels near Disneyland in <span class=\"xn-location\">Anaheim<\/span> and Hilton Tapestry in <span class=\"xn-location\">Milwaukee, Wisconsin<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Michael Cohen<\/span>, from CIM Group, shared his transition from hospitality roles in <span class=\"xn-location\">New York<\/span> to <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles<\/span>, focusing on investments and asset management.

Following the formal introductions, the board members adjourned to a more casual mixer at the Fairmont Century Plaza, to get to know each other better.<\/p>\n<p>The ILHA is thrilled to offer its full support to the <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles<\/span> chapter as it continues to grow and thrive within the luxury hospitality landscape. We eagerly anticipate the opportunity to host more networking events, foster meaningful connections, and take a deeper dive into the diverse discussions and initiatives within the ILHA community. As our chapter members become more involved in ILHA activities, including webinars and speaking engagements, we are confident that their contributions will enrich our collective knowledge and drive excellence in the industry. Looking ahead, we eagerly anticipate the upcoming ILHA INSPIRE conference at the end of the year, where the <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles<\/span> chapter will have the chance to showcase their expertise and meet fellow ILHA members and supporters from around the globe. Together, we are ready to shape the future of luxury hospitality, and the ILHA stands ready to support every step of the journey.<\/p>\n<p><b>About the International Luxury Hotel Association<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The International Luxury Hotel Association is\u00a0luxury\u00a0hospitality&#8217;s\u00a0preeminent association promoting, unifying and advancing the industry through insight, opinion\u00a0and research.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>ILHA reaches an audience of more than 1 million plus hotel professionals in 90+ countries and produces\u00a0ILHA webinars, LUXURY HOTELIERS Magazine,\u00a0and the INSPIRE SUMMIT.\u00a0They also run LinkedIn&#8217;s largest hospitality and travel group which ranks in the top 100 of the more than 10 million professional groups on LinkedIn.
