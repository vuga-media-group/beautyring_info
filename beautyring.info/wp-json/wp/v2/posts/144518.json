A few stellar presenters included Raven-Symon\u00e9, Rory Kennedy, Amber Stevens West, Amy Ziering and Chanel West Coast. <\/p>\n<p>Wallis Annenberg presented The Living Legend Honoree Award to Ann-Margret and said,\u201cLegend means you haven\u2019t just shared a screen with Elvis Presley and Jack Nicholson and Jack Lemmon \u2013 you\u2019ve dominated it.  Fame is fickle, especially for women.  And when you reach your 80\u2019s, if you\u2019re lucky, people want to dip you in bronze and stick you on a shelf somewhere.  Legend or not,\u201d She continued, \u201cBut why gather dust on a shelf, when you are still young and vital and ready to rock? Why go gentle into the good night, when you can ride your lavender Harley till sunrise and be your own damn woman?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Women&#8217;s Image Network Awards, since 1993, has been a beacon for gender equality in the media,\u201d said Ann-Margret, The Living Legend Honoree. \u201cTonight, we celebrate not only the achievements of extraordinary women but also the transformative power of film and television to shape perceptions and inspire change. Film and television possess a unique ability to challenge stereotypes and cultivate empathy. As artists, we hold the brush that paints the<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\ndiverse tapestry of women&#8217;s lives. It is a responsibility I&#8217;ve embraced throughout my career, choosing projects that celebrate the strength, resilience, and diversity of women.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The evening was filled with powerful influences across television and film and other notables plus additional merits of recognition were given to Loretta Devine, The Lifetime Achievement Honoree and the Humanitarian Honoree, Regina K. Scully.<\/p>\n<p>Founded by Phyllis Stuart in 1993, the Women&#8217;s Image Network Awards have been a beacon of recognition for male and female artists dedicated to advancing positive portrayals of women in media. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was a privilege to celebrate our remarkable honorees: Ann-Margret, Loretta Devine and Regina K. Scully,\u201d said Phyllis Stuart, WIN Awards Founder and producer. \u201cAll three women live remarkable lives shaped by kindness, grace, service and authenticity.
