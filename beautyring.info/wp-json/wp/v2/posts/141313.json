The award for Documentary Feature was given for James Gossard\u2019s authentic and immersive-artistic documentary, Divine Instinct, which explores the psychological world and art of sculptor and mixed-media artist Gary Spinosa.<\/p>\n<p>The film includes interviews at the Erie Art Museum with curator Susan Barnett and in Ohio with the Director of the Sandusky Cultural Center and avid art collector Charles T Mayer. Art historian and sculptor John Edwards and Pulitzer-nominated author Diana Hume George, Ph.D. Professor Emerita of English and Women&#8217;s Studies, Penn State Behrend, also add their voices on screen to discuss the philosophy and psychology of Spinosa\u2019s art. Archival material for the film was supported by the Cleveland Institute of Art where Gary is an alumnus (\u201972); the Cleveland Museum of Art where Gary exhibited; and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh where Gary received inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>As Director and Producer Clint Gaige of Growth Media Productions described the film: <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cDivine Instinct is a peek behind the creative curtain. When analyzing artistic work, we often get bogged down in process or technique but too often, it&#8217;s talked about in very generic terms as if the process is too sacred to share. Director James Gossard cuts through all of that. This film unapologetically investigates what makes an artist tick. Gary Spinosa is surprisingly open and honest about his work in a way that manages to be both mystical and practical. This documentary is a singular focused film that captures what it is to be an artist hence, the human experience. As I watched Divine Instinct this Henry James quote came to mind, \u2018We work in the dark \u2014 we do what we can \u2014 we give what we have. Our doubt is our passion and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art.\u2019 I don&#8217;t think there is a better description for this film. Doubt, Passion, and Madness are all masterfully explored through the telling of this story.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>An Alexandria Film Festival viewer also commented, \u201cDivine Instinct is a warm hug for artists.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Producer and Director James Gossard noted, \u201cIt\u2019s terrific for the brilliant work of the production crew to receive these awards and acknowledgement for their work.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The IndieFEST Film Awards went to:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tAward of Merit Special Mention: Documentary Feature (USA), Divine Instinct &#8211; James Gossard, Producer p.g.a. with Executive Producers Jonathan Jarrett, Ann Gossard, Monica Lee Bellais, Kathy Yerich (Pixel Farm), and James Gossard<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tAward of Merit Special Mention: Cinematography (Stewart D.
