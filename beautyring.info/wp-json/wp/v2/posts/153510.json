While over a half of million attendees are expected to pour into New Orleans to celebrate the annual July 4th Weekend Festival of Culture, on Friday, July 5th at 1:50PM in the Black Box Theater in the New Orleans Convention Center, filmmaker, Kirk Shannon-Butts, will present a live reading of his acclaimed television series pilot, \u201cWhite Ceiling,\u201d as part of the 3rd Annual Essence Film Fest. Produced by Essence Studios, this event is free and open to the public. It is the public debut of &#8220;White Ceiling&#8221; and will feature noted New Orleans actors reading all the character roles live for the very first time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhite Ceiling\u201d unfolds the rarified journey of Randall Danvers, 28, an art curator\u2019s rise in the cutthroat billion-dollar art world. Smart, talented, Black, and gay, Randall is one of the most sought-after young curators in the New York art scene.  Even with this, the debonair Harlem resident is dismissed by his conniving mentor and legendary gallery owner, Fiona Lautner, while she maintains the lucrative artists roster Randall cultivated generating millions of sales for the Fiona Lautner Gallery. Free and untangled, Randall makes the bold decision to open his own gallery way uptown deep in a neighborhood where artists live and create yet no galleries exist. A unicorn who turns into a wolf, &#8220;White Ceiling&#8221; follows Randall as he navigates his way to the pinnacle of the ruthless art world as he manages love, family, friendship, business, and the 1% who invest in art.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter my last film, &#8220;Julien&#8217;s Bed,&#8221; in 2012, I met an emerging artist who was having his very first significant exhibition. I worked with him doing Marketing, PR, Social Media, Content Creation, and Curating. The exhibition was a huge hit selling 9 of 11 artworks in less than two (2) hours. With that, my journey in the art world began.  Soon, I learned that less than 2% of Art Curators at art institutions and galleries across the United States were Black. These experiences prompted me to write my Art Diaries detailing and documenting all of the drama, gatekeeping, and obstacles I tackled on my journey to becoming an Art Curator. These encounters are the foundation for &#8220;White Ceiling.&#8221; While \u201cWhite Ceiling\u201d is a work of fiction. It is deeply rooted and inspired by my own experiences in the contemporary art world,\u201d says \u201cWhite Ceiling\u201d writer and creator, Kirk Shannon-Butts.<\/p>\n<p>The Essence Film Festival showcases exceptional original projects in film, television, music, and new media created by Black storytellers across the African diaspora. EFF believes Black stories deserve to be told in their full truth with intent to disrupt mainstream Hollywood narratives. Now in its third year, the festival is building a movement that uplifts and normalizes globalization and fosters the empowerment of Black creatives. \u201cWhite Ceiling\u201d is Shannon-Butts&#8217; very first television series pilot and fulfills Essence Film Fest\u2019s mission to connect Black storytellers with audiences seeking to discover fresh talent, new voices, diverse perspectives, and innovative narratives. It is rapidly becoming the premiere destination for emerging global creatives.  Each festival day offers the public free live script readings, movie screenings, industry conversations, symposiums, workshops, panel discussions, and other transformative cinematic experiences and events. <\/p>\n<p>Shannon-Butts holds a BA in Marketing &amp; Arts Management from The American College and an MFA in Film\/TV Production from Chapman University. His first feature film, &#8220;Blueprint,&#8221; brought worldwide accolades and critical acclaim receiving, \u2019Best Film from the African Diaspora\u2019 nomination at FESPACO in Burkina Faso, nominated for \u2019Best First Feature\u2019 at Frameline, and shortlisted for the prestigious Gotham Awards&#8217; &#8220;Best Film Not Playing at a Theater Near You.&#8221;  He has been featured in L\u2019Uomo Vogue, Out magazine&#8217;s &#8220;Out100,&#8221; and Uptown magazine\u2019s &#8220;Flipping the Script: 35 People to Watch in Hollywood.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For more information, contact Kirk Ray at kirk@flickeria.com or 917.545.4360.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Kirk Ray<br \/>FLICKERIA<br \/>+1 917-545-4360<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/719537530\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Kirk Shannon-Butts Filmmaker Reel<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/380801146?app_id=122963\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\" title=\"Kirk Shannon-Butts. . . .A Director's Reel\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=wb_mfnNDKbZE_tG0&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      June 13, 2024, 12:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/719537530\/lgbt-filmmaker-s-white-ceiling-tv-pilot-set-for-live-reading-at-30th-anniversary-of-essence-festival-in-new-orleans\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
