By category, the market is divided into skin &amp; sun care products, hair care products, deodorants &amp; fragrances, and makeup &amp; color cosmetics. The skin and sun care products segment occupied the major cosmetics market share in 2022 and is projected to maintain its dominance during the forecast period. A rising focus on holistic skincare and the incorporation of SPF into everyday regimens are among the skin and sun care product trends in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>To protect against environmental variables, consumers prefer products with enhanced antioxidant and anti-pollution qualities. In response to consumer desire for gentle and sustainable solutions, natural and clean ingredients are becoming more and more popular. As skincare and sunscreen products become more personalized, they may now be made to address the needs and concerns of particular skin types. As a result, the industry is witnessing a rise in hybrid products that provide benefits for both skincare and sun protection, streamlining routines and appealing to time-conscious consumers.<\/p>\n<p>By gender, the market is segmented into men, women, and unisex. The men segment is anticipated to grow at a moderate rate during the forecast period. The popularity of men&#8217;s grooming and cosmetics is rising. Development of skincare products made specifically for men&#8217;s requirements, such as moisturizers and anti-aging treatments, is one of the key trends in the industry. The popularity of facial hair is reflected in the need for beard care products and specialized grooming appliances. Men are becoming more accepting of makeup, which has fueled the growth of male makeup firms and gender-neutral merchandise. Influencer marketing is assisting in the de-stigmatization of male cosmetics. As firms work to accommodate different skin tones and grooming preferences, inclusivity is on the increase.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on distribution channel, it is classified into hypermarkets\/supermarkets, specialty stores, pharmacies, online sales channel, and others. The online sales channel segment is anticipated to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. The popularity of e-commerce is on the rise, providing consumers with ease and a wide range of products. Shopping experiences can be made more engaging by using virtual try-on tools and augmented reality software. Brands are able to establish direct relationships with consumers due to the success of direct-to-consumer (DTC) business strategies. A growing number of people are utilizing subscription services and getting customized product recommendations. Reviews and user-generated content have an impact on purchasing decisions, while social media campaigns and influencer marketing are crucial for online sales. Consumers&#8217; growing preference for environmentally and cruelty-friendly products is influencing the industry&#8217;s e-commerce sales. Sustainability and ethical sourcing are becoming more important in online retail. This is creating cosmetics market opportunities and cosmetics market demand.<\/p>\n<p>\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/checkout-final\/ff90f5e254da51bd1795ada04c2edcbd\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/checkout-final\/ff90f5e254da51bd1795ada04c2edcbd<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>Asia-Pacific dominated the global cosmetics market in 2022, and its dominance is anticipated to continue during the forecast period.
