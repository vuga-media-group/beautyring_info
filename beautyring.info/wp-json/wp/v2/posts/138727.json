This is the story of Garrett Glass.<\/p>\n<p>Garrett Glass is the author of several historical fiction books which provide hypothetical, non-canonical accounts surrounding the growth of Christianity as described in The Bible. His first book in the series starts on the day of Christ\u2019s crucifixion, and from there his books contrast two storylines: the path the earliest followers of Jesus took in response to his death; and the response of the Roman empire to this growing threat to imperial rule.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe focus of these books is to contrast what was going on at the highest levels of the Roman Empire, against the activities and struggles of the small Christian communities that were popping up in all major cities of the Empire,\u201d summarizes Garrett.  \u201cMy approach is not to make this Biblical, though I am using individuals cited in The Bible. In writing Jehoshua: Signs and Wonders, and Jehoshua: Conflagration, I tried to explain why people at the time would construe certain events as miracles.  Fundamentally, my novels follow major events as described in The Bible, or in the historical record.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Garrett\u2019s upbringing was decidedly religious.  As a youth he was an altar boy. In his twenties, however, he became interested in the Jesus Movement of the 1970\u2019s. This was a period when many books were being published that offered historically based, realistic, and non-supernatural explanations for Jesus\u2019 miracles and his supposed resurrection. As a result of this revolutionary thinking regarding Jesus\u2019 life and mission, Garrett became disenfranchised with the Catholic Church and religion.<\/p>\n<p>What followed was a twenty-five-year career in banking, during which he did not practice religion. Writing historical fiction when he retired was at first an experiment for him. \u201cI was thinking of a gift for my wife on our 30th anniversary \u2013 something I couldn\u2019t get at a store,\u201d said Garrett. \u201cI set about secretly writing the Jehoshua novels, and discovered how much I enjoyed the freedom of writing fiction, especially in comparison to a career writing corporate memos. I\u2019ve been writing fiction and non-fiction ever since.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>By authoring such books, Garrett\u2019s readers have often assumed Garrett is an agnostic or an atheist. To explain his own religious beliefs, Garrett authored Who Cuts God\u2019s Hair. \u201cI describe myself as an atheist, but with a big difference,\u201d says Garrett. \u201cI believe God exists, but I also know where he lives. In Who Cuts God\u2019s Hair, I establish both where he resides, and why belief in God is the default position of mankind. It\u2019s not delusional to believe in God.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Who Cut God\u2019s Hair is divided into three parts. \u201cThe first part, and what I most would like to emphasize, is a model that I created,\u201d explains Garrett. \u201cThe model describes the process that anyone goes through from infancy to adulthood in developing a belief in God.  We live in a remarkable age when advances in neuroscience are discovering astounding facts about the brain. I\u2019ve used this research, along with work by prominent mental health experts and sociologists, to develop the model. To the extent I\u2019ve contributed something unique to our understanding of God-belief, it is to discover how this belief develops as a newborn progresses from birth through childhood.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor example,\u201d continues Garrett, \u201cwe\u2019re taught to believe that someone who lives a moral and worthy life will be rewarded with life after death, in heaven. In fact, life begins in heaven. A newborn enters this world naked, helpless, and utterly dependent on adult caregivers for its survival. To the newborn, its caregivers appear to be all-powerful creators, all-knowing, and all loving, because they provide aid and comfort when summoned. These experiences create a neural imprint for what I call Template God.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy age one the infant has three-dimensional sight, and can recognize caregivers as external to them, \u2018out there,\u2019 with human characteristics. The gods are now positioned as humans, in space. At age two, when the infant moves into childhood, language develops. Not only can the child communicate with the gods, but the child discovers that the gods can be angry, sometimes punishing the child. To cope with this discovery, children often take on themselves blame for any punishments they receive. This is when guilt develops, which is such a fundamental component of religious belief \u2013 guilt in one\u2019s unworthiness in the presence of God.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSomewhere from age four to eight a terrible trauma occurs. The child learns that the gods have clay feet \u2013 they are not immortal, they are not perfect, they are not all powerful, because they will die someday, as will the child. This discovery is equivalent to the child taking a bite from the apple in the Garden of Eden. The discovery of death results in the expulsion from heaven. At this stage, which I call Unmasked God, children learn a fundamental skill essential to human survival \u2013 psychological repression of thoughts of death. One other beneficial thing occurs in the brain at this time, known as infantile amnesia, in which the synapses that connect neurons are pruned. As a result, all of our infant and childhood memories remain stored in our brain, and influence our behavior unconsciously, but we cannot summon these memories consciously.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Garrett describes the result of this trauma as the creation of a life-long yearning for a return to heaven \u2013 a \u201cGod-shaped hole in our heart,\u201d as Evangelical Christians describe it. Since God was once real in our lives, we create an illusion of God, living \u201cout there\u201d in the cosmos, who will grant us eternal life in heaven. The majority of people today believe in God and live their lives in religious faith, and according to Garrett there is nothing delusional about this.  These people are responding to the promptings of their unconscious mind. About a third of adults question or grow out of the illusion, but it is wrong to think these individuals are evil because they are godless.<\/p>\n<p>Concludes Garrett: \u201cI find agnostics and atheists are just as moral as religious people even though they have no god.  And why is that?  Because the hundreds of thousands of experiences receiving love, sustenance and knowledge from infancy through childhood motivates all of us as adults to extend these same gifts to others.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Close Up Radio will feature Garrett Glass in an interview with Jim Masters on Wednesday December 13th at 1pm Eastern<\/p>\n<p>Listen to the show on <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.blogtalkradio.com\/closeupradio\/2023\/12\/13\/close-up-radio-spotlights-author-garrett-glass\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">BlogTalkRadio<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions for our guest, please call (347) 996-3389<\/p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/whocutgodshair.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/whocutgodshair.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Lou Ceparano<br \/>Close Up Television &amp; Radio<br \/>+1 631-850-3314<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/674304737\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CloseUpTelevisionandRadio\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=BpTEAqMoAUkKyVPq&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      December 11, 2023, 14:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/674304737\/author-garrett-glass-to-be-featured-on-close-up-radio\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
