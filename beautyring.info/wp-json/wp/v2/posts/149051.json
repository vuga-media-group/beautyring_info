This new collaboration marks a significant step in G-Rod&#8217;s career, focusing on expanding his presence as the next go-to bad guy in the TV\/film industry, particularly in roles that showcase his range as an action actor. G-Rod is setting sights on further solidifying his position in Hollywood, especially in portraying villainous characters \u2014a niche he has been anchoring down for over a decade. His upcoming roles in projects like &#8220;Bad Boys: Ride or Die,&#8221; &#8220;Seal Team,&#8221; and &#8220;Red One&#8221; reflect this decisive move. <\/p>\n<p>In a statement about his career, G-Rod said, \u201cThis is a very exciting time for me. I\u2019m just a kid from the slums of Venezuela and now I\u2019m playing a bad guy in some of the most popular shows on TV. It\u2019s all a bit unreal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Bad Boys Ride or Die&#8221; is set for release on June 7. Speaking to the media, G-Rod said, \u201cYeah, of course. I play a bad guy in \u201cBad Boys Ride or Die.\u201d I can&#8217;t say much other than my character&#8217;s look, which came from director Adil El Arbi and his inspiration for it was Presidente Salinas. I almost died when he showed me a picture, but he was so excited about it I just smiled and said\u2013let\u2019s do it! They shipped me back to hair and makeup, turning me into El Presidente.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In &#8220;Seal Team&#8221; he\u2019ll help close out the long-running TV series in Colombia by playing a drug cartel leader and in \u201cRed One\u201d, he plays one of the Yul Lad\u2019s, mountain-dwelling Icelandic monsters, led by Gryla, their evil mother played by Kiernan Shipka. Red One is scheduled to hit theatres in November 2024. He also just wrapped work on \u201cFight Night\u201d in Atlanta, working alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Hart and Terrance Howard.<\/p>\n<p>The collaboration with ADS Management represents a focused approach to choosing projects that align with G-Rod&#8217;s career goals and personal growth as an action actor. In a statement, Curtis said \u201cI\u2019m excited to welcome him onboard and look forward to working with him!\u201d ADS Management is known for its comprehensive support and strategic career planning for its clients.
