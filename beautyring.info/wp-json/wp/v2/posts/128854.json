The target segment is expected to dominate the global food packaging industry during the assessment period.<\/p>\n<p>The food sector is exploring new ways and designs to present the product and packaging. Flexible packaging such as laminates and multi-layered high-barrier films, offers an array of customized options that makes it easy for brands to adopt according to the customer demands.<\/p>\n<p>The need for packaged food is being fuelled by changing consumer demand patterns, favorable government policies, and stockpiling. Similarly, rising consumption of processed food products and growing focus of companies on improving shelf life of products are expected to boost the market.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers in developing economies are switching from unpackaged to packaged foods as a result of the increasing food safety crisis. They are increasingly choosing packaged products with a longer shelf life due to rising health consciousness and awareness about the importance of eating fresh food.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Download the sample report to expand your industry knowledge, acquire a comprehensive summary, and gain valuable insights. <\/strong><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=Stt--KOzGSk5bxGLBQhiM1pXXz2s9bY2M-s9K9PxIIA6tKLFwgagRmlpBwDfIR1sT2PHkG017l_0fRK4SKNCQK3ZRZ3VooNOUpJFUhwensBfSV_rbIe78Pz6jcCqYGD-P15cWvRnMAKW-Q2bUFBCFjQhBsMx2g7oMzcc5GwBWpp8ERESGlEXNBbVWRbSF61WDbrdD16DnqTnVl9I96jyKg==\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.futuremarketinsights.com\/reports\/sample\/rep-gb-14837<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Demand for convenience foods is on the rise as customers&#8217; disposable income rises at the same time as they don&#8217;t have enough time to prepare their meals.<\/p>\n<p>Because packaged and processed meals are simple and quick to prepare, the worldwide packaged and processed food business is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. This in turn is likely to uplift food packaging demand and create lucrative opportunities for packaging companies.<\/p>\n<p>Convenience foods are also improving in terms of quality and variety. The rapidly rising urban population is expected to have a substantial impact on the business which will eventually bolster food packaging sales.<\/p>\n<p>High emphasis on food safety is another key factor expected to boost the food packaging industry during the assessment period.<\/p>\n<p>A recent study carried out by the Tetra Pack Index says that almost 50% of consumers believe that improving food safety is the responsibility of the manufacturers. This has emphasized the rethinking of food production and finding solutions that benefit the players starting from farmers to the customers throughout the supply chain.<\/p>\n<p>The companies need to focus on developing packaging solutions that can protect food during storage and transportation. Combining innovation and technologies, food manufacturers and packaging companies need to enhance food safety by managing the supply chain and ensuring profitability in the competitive market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key <\/strong><strong>Takeaways<\/strong><strong> from <\/strong><strong>Food <\/strong><strong>P<\/strong><strong>ackaging<\/strong> <strong>Market<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">The global food packaging industry is expected to reach a valuation of US$ 592.8 billion by 2033.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">By packaging type, flexible food packaging segment is estimated to hold 1\/2 value share of the market during the forecast period.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Based on application, dairy products segment is projected to thrive at 5.7% CAGR through 2033.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">South Asia food packaging industry is predicted to account for about 26% of the worldwide market share during the forecast period.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">The United States food packaging industry is predicted to reach a valuation of US$ 73.5 billion by 2033.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">India food packaging industry is likely to create an incremental opportunity of US$ 26.1 billion during the assessment period.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>\u201c<\/strong><strong><em>With <\/em><\/strong><strong><em>changing lifestyles and increasing work<\/em><\/strong> <strong><em>hours<\/em><\/strong><strong><em>,<\/em><\/strong><strong><em> food <\/em><\/strong><strong><em>consumption<\/em><\/strong> <strong><em>patterns <\/em><\/strong><strong><em>of consumers are shifting which will help the <\/em><\/strong><strong><em>target <\/em><\/strong><strong><em>market to <\/em><\/strong><strong><em>thrive rapidly.
