This groundbreaking work offers profound insights into how happiness at work significantly impacts productivity, reshaping conventional leadership paradigms.<\/p>\n<p>Extensive research, such as the Oxford and BT study, reveals that happy workers are 13% more productive. \u201cThe Excellent Leader\u201d delves into this crucial correlation, emphasizing that productivity is deeply rooted in employee happiness and Corporate Social Responsibility rather than solely in goal-oriented or results-driven approaches. Markus van Alphen, the Founder and Director of The Excellent Organization, has authored over 15 influential books on leadership and psychology. His new release is the first in a trilogy dedicated to excellent leadership. As a specialist and expert trainer in interpersonal conversational skills, Markus introduces the concept of &#8220;Observational Listening&#8221; in this book, a methodology that elevates active listening to a higher plane.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Excellent Leader\u201d launched in February 2023, comprises six insightful chapters. It offers an in-depth overview of Observational Listening, demonstrating why it is an essential tool for leaders aiming to truly understand and connect with their teams. The book also highlights the importance of emotional intelligence, empathy and creating psychological safety within teams, all key factors in enhancing employee well-being and productivity.<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nRenowned leadership psychologist and author of more than 15 books in Dutch and English, Markus van Alphen developed the Observational Listening concept in 2014.  Observational Listening goes a step further than active listening in understanding what an individual has to say. By observing what emotions they are experiencing, you really get the other\u2019s story and their underlying emotions, whereby the other feels heard, seen, acknowledged and psychologically safe, resulting in increased happiness, motivation, and overall success. Observational listening augments empathic leadership in a powerful way into excellent leadership.<\/p>\n<p>Markus helps leaders and individuals worldwide increase workplace and personal relationship effectiveness, transform their environments, and succeed.  In addition, Markus is a trainer, lecturer, and curriculum developer for undergraduate and postgraduate psychology and counseling students at various colleges and universities across the Netherlands. He holds a master\u2019s degree in psychology from the University of Amsterdam and a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering that he received from the University of Cape Town.<\/p>\n<p>The primary motivation for writing this book is his desire to make a significant impact on people&#8217;s sense of well-being. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is by enhancing their work experience. The biggest factor in determining a person&#8217;s well-being at work is how they are treated by their leaders. This insight drove him to focus on empathic leadership, which prioritizes well-being.<\/p>\n<p>His mission is to equip leaders with the skills they need to become excellent leaders\u2014those who can support their team&#8217;s well-being in an appropriate and sustainable manner. This aligns perfectly with his core purpose: to make the world a better place by fostering empathy and humanity. Through this book, he aims to provide leaders with the tools to create a more satisfying and productive work environment, ultimately benefiting both the individual and the organization.<\/p>\n<p>Message from the Author<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPlease buy the books.
