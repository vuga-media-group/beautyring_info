find coping with jet lag to be a challenge, and over 53% claim that the fear of missing out makes them ignore how tired their body is when traveling. Jet lag itself can come in many forms, with the most common side effects people experience are feelings of exhaustion (26%), difficulty sleeping (25%), and headaches (23%).<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">One in six respondents claim they regularly employ strategies to try and avoid the dreaded jet lag while traveling, from quirky sleeping habits to copious amounts of caffeine. Staying hydrated (48%), power naps (35%) and using a neck pillow on the flight or in the airport (25%) are go-to methods for many as they try to adjust to different time zones.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">As the global brand known for challenging the status quo for the non-stop traveler, YOTEL is stepping in to help travelers combat jet lag, by partnering with Fount \u2013 a human performance R&amp;D company specializing in creating the ultimate health and performance tools for anyone looking to optimize their life \u2014to provide guests with its newly launched post-flight jet lag supplement protocol known as <i>FlyKitt Rescue<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">An all-natural timed supplement program specifically for anyone already experiencing jet lag symptoms, <i>FlyKitt Rescue<\/i> helps decrease inflammation, restore normal immune activity, support sleep, boost energy, and get travelers back on rhythm to continue their adventures.
