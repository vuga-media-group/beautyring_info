This can be attributed to the fact that liquid PC-based superplasticizers are growing in popularity in decorative concrete applications to enhance workability and surface finish. They help achieve better color dispersion, texture retention, and surface smoothness in decorative concrete finishes such as stamped concrete, stained concrete, and exposed aggregate surfaces.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">However, the powder is the fastest-growing segment in the PC-based concrete superplasticizer market growing with a CAGR of 9.2%. Powdered PC-based concrete superplasticizers are widely used in the production of ready-mix concrete. Concrete plants incorporate these superplasticizers into their batching process to improve the workability and flowability of the concrete mixes, ensuring consistent quality and performance. Precast concrete manufacturers utilize powdered superplasticizers to enhance the fluidity and moldability of concrete during casting.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Procure Complete Report (315 Pages PDF with Insights, Charts, Tables, and Figures) @<\/b> <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=Pv6b_PmEUC2gE4_kUsLNLQPO5nTQPl4wBod0XEgtpFgsfSnawVeHCDEISQSIKqWOQLn_8q1R2yX6juzZuXP919-wNXFA5jrHxSjp9DVl7-Y=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>https:\/\/bit.ly\/4av3NwX<\/b><\/a> \u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>The ready-mix concrete segment is expected to lead throughout the forecast period.<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">By\u00a0application, the ready-mix concrete segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for one-third of the global PC-based concrete superplasticizer market revenue, and is expected to retain its dominance throughout the forecast period, whereas ready-mix concrete segment is also the fastest growing segment expected to grow with the CAGR of 9.4%. Ready-mix concrete plants use high-range water-reducing admixtures, namely sulfonate naphthalene formaldehyde condensate, for making standard cement concrete. These admixtures are used to economize the cost of concrete by reducing the quantity of water.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Asia-Pacific to <\/b><b>maintain<\/b><b> its dominance by 2032.<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">By\u00a0region, Asia-Pacific held the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2022, accounting for more than half of the PC-based concrete superplasticizer market revenue and is expected to dominate in terms of revenue throughout the forecast timeframe, whereas Asia-Pacific is also the fastest growing region with a CAGR of 8.6% during the forecast period. Polycarboxylate-based concrete superplasticizers have become increasingly popular in the construction industry worldwide, including in the Asia-Pacific region. These chemicals are essential additives in modern concrete production, offering improved workability, durability, and strength characteristics to concrete mixtures. China stands out as one of the largest consumers of concrete superplasticizers globally, and polycarboxylate-based superplasticizers have gained significant traction in the country&#8217;s construction sector. With the rapid pace of urbanization and infrastructure development, the demand for high-performance concrete has surged. Polycarboxylate-based superplasticizers are favored for their ability to achieve high levels of slump retention and workability, crucial for large-scale construction projects.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Want to Access the Statistical Data and Graphs, Key Players&#8217; Strategies:<\/b> <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=Pv6b_PmEUC2gE4_kUsLNLR6yd9lYjXa44Q9dviY3QvGR7l-nuuUZZr1gPAesyLJDJx-IihsOKKnfxAybNUJb9EggTaKynl3fxgmgdw3ACBNG6mh9EDBKo32PqRL68VmFMHb1VIiodCJ_xN8l5nUmzd9CSJD266zgMncejhIpRB75-sKXhX53cEuMLlSuqVsI49FFQQQpQvvW8SVoMRq5qAGlowwmyLWRgq0PZ286XPw494VzzGA54uCprwoU-Us3ia3fZcANM7Vw67NoWoBoIQYQLDYXNsg9jlSj8UDjZsk=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/pc-based-concrete-superplasticizer-market\/purchase-options<\/b><\/a> \u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Players: &#8211;<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li> Sika AG\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li> Arkema\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li> APEI S.p.A.\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li> KZJ New Materials Group\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li> JIAHUA CHEMICALS INC.\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li> TSC\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li> Shandong Zovae High-tech Material Co., Ltd.\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li> Metro Chemicals\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li> MUHU (China) Construction Materials Co., Ltd.\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li> Sakshi Chem Sciences Private Limited.\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The report provides a detailed analysis of these key players in the global PC-based concrete superplasticizer market.
