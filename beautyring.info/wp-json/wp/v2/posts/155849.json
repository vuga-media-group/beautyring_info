The visit underscores East Point\u2019s global initiative of \u201cWhere the World Meets\u201d and will strengthen partnerships with the hospitality, business, and innovation sectors with the diaspora to drive economic growth. <\/p>\n<p>During her visit, Obaze made a pivotal stop at the renowned restaurant, This Is It! Southern Kitchen &amp; Bar-B-Q. There, she met with Shelley \u201cButch\u201d Anthony, III, President and CEO of This Is It!, to discuss potential business ventures and collaborative efforts. Both leaders are at the forefront of their businesses while maintaining strong family foundations and deep-rooted cultural values. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This mission trip is not just about business; it&#8217;s about creating a legacy of economic empowerment that goes beyond borders. By fostering collaborations between East Point and Ghana, we are paving the way for entrepreneurial growth and prosperity for our communities&#8221; says Obaze. <\/p>\n<p>Tourism is a powerful economic driver of sustainable economic prosperity for the East Point community as it brings new tax dollars to the area while supporting people and places.  \u201cIt is imperative that leaders such as me in the tourism industry comprehend impending trends with tourism globally and contribute to its sustainable development\u201d says Chantel Ross Francois, President of the East Point Convention and Visitors Bureau. <\/p>\n<p>She adds \u201cEast Point is less than 5 minutes to the world\u2019s busiest airport and 8 miles to the major artery of downtown Atlanta.  This prime destination provides world class hospitality to CEOs such as Valerie Obaze to host group meetings, conduct business and leisure travel.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The City of East Point sees an increase in revenue through hotel-motel occupancy tax when people such as Obaze enjoy accommodations at one of the 20 branded hotels in the city.  As visitors travel to East Point and use transportation options like MARTA, dine in local restaurants, shop, and explore key attractions, it drives significant impact and growth, benefiting local businesses and the community.  East Point Convention and Visitors Bureau is committed to putting East Point\u2019s best foot forward globally through initiatives such as B2B engagement. <\/p>\n<p>Michael Djaba, CCO of Ifactorylive Africa, expressed his enthusiasm for the initiative, stating, &#8220;I look forward to more cross-continental meetings between CEO\u2019s in East Point and Ghana. With the East Point Convention and Visitors Bureau spearheading efforts, we are set to generate mutually beneficial business opportunities that will have a lasting impact.&#8221;  <\/p>\n<p>To learn more about the East Point Convention and Visitors Bureau, please <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/visiteastpoint.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">visiteastpoint.org<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>ABOUT EAST POINT CONVENTION AND VISITORS BUREAU <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nEast Point Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau is a distinguished organization committed to excellence and promoting the City of East Point, Georgia, as a unique premier travel destination of \u201cWhere the World Meets.\u201d EPCVB strives to strengthen tourism, support local businesses, and create noteworthy experiences for travelers through strategic branding, destination management, and community partnerships.
