data-wpel-link=\"external\">Yves Giacometti<\/a>, Regional Vice President and General Manager, Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza.\u00a0 &#8220;And to see something that much fewer have seen until now, we suggest the Step Pyramid at Djoser, recently reopened after a 14 year-restoration and the centre of a tomb complex that is older even than the Pyramids of Giza, by several hundred years.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To journey even deeper into history, a trip to Luxor and the paradise city of Arwan is a day not soon forgotten.\u00a0 Four Seasons offers a door-to-door experience, including limo transfers and a Four Seasons escort through the airport.\u00a0 Then, after a short flight, Four Seasons guests are met with a carefully chosen guide who will be at their side for the entire day before returning to <span class=\"xn-location\">Cairo<\/span> that evening or the next day.\u00a0 Often called the world&#8217;s greatest open air museum, treasures are continuing to be discovered.\u00a0 &#8220;This is where legends come to life as you walk in the footsteps of the Pharaohs through temples and monuments, visit the famous Valley of the Kings, and tour very interesting museums that tell the stories of ancient <span class=\"xn-location\">Egypt<\/span>,&#8221; says Chief Concierge Dalia Khalili.\u00a0 &#8220;Our team will ensure you don&#8217;t miss a thing, and we&#8217;ll even suggest a few surprises along the way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Those preferring to stay in the city will be spoiled for choice, from the city&#8217;s many restored palaces to its performing arts centres, contemporary art galleries (<i>tip:<\/i> check out the extensive art collection at Four Seasons as an introduction to the city&#8217;s burgeoning arts scene), numerous museums and the <span class=\"xn-location\">Cairo<\/span> Opera House, home to international and local musical performances with first class productions of ballet, opera and symphonic works.<\/p>\n<p>No visit to the city is complete without a trip the Moez area, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and Khan El Khalili, the 1,000-year-old markets, in search of everything from artisan pieces to funky souvenirs. Then as the sun sets, a leisurely cruise on calm waters of the Nile in a traditional <i>felucca<\/i> takes you past the evening-lit <span class=\"xn-location\">Cairo<\/span> Opera House, sparkling Cairo Tower, the celebrated Cairo Yacht Club and several palaces as you sip on Bedouin-style mint tea.<\/p>\n<p>To begin planning exploration of the city and its surroundings, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3898109-1&amp;h=1810058819&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fourseasons.com%2Fcaironp%2Foffers%2F%3Fsource%3Dpr_corporate_Egyptcollection&amp;a=book+a+getaway+by+the+Nile\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">book a getaway by the Nile<\/a> at the riverside Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza, and contact the Concierge team for personalized recommendations to suit all interests.<\/p>\n<p><b><span class=\"xn-location\">Alexandria<\/span>: The Pearl of the Mediterranean<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Relatively youthful in comparison to <span class=\"xn-location\">Cairo<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Alexandria<\/span> was founded by, and named for, Alexander the Great in 331 BC.\u00a0 The arrival of the Macedonians in <span class=\"xn-location\">Egypt<\/span> was just another moment in a long history of cross-cultural influences that can be seen all over the city.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>For example, take Pompey&#8217;s Pillar, erected to honour the Roman Emperor Diocletian around 300 AD.\u00a0 &#8220;Climbing it is forbidden of course, but it&#8217;s fun to think about those who did in the past, and the stories of its construction and its role in many periods of history are fascinating,&#8221; says Chief Concierge Shaimaa Youssry, Four Seasons Hotel Alexandria at San Stefano.<\/p>\n<p>A visit to the Roman Amphitheatre takes one through the remains of the ancient city of <span class=\"xn-location\">Alexandria<\/span> during the Roman Period.\u00a0 Then, venture on a tour of where the legendary Pharos Lighthouse once stood &#8211; The Citadel Qaitbay. The 15th-century landmark is now a naval museum with lookout towers and a unique collection of weapons.
