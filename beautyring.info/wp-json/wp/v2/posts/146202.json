Introducing these items is projected to boost industry growth during the predicted period significantly.<\/h2>\n<p>New York, United States, March  13, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &#8212; A wiper system, often known as a windshield wiper system, is a vital component in automobiles that removes precipitation, snow, dirt, and debris from the windshield, allowing the driver to see clearly. This technology is especially important during bad weather, such as rain, snow, sleet, or fog, because it increases driving safety and reduces accidents caused by impaired eyesight. Due to increased car production, the wiper system market share is expected to grow at a 6.3% CAGR.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, demand for these items is driven by the demand for rear wiper systems in the low-end car category. Rain-sensing wiper systems are predicted to fuel industry expansion since they increase vehicle safety by lowering driver concentration during severe weather. The introduction of these items is expected to stimulate industry growth during the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" height=\"406\" name=\"GNW_RichHtml_External_IMG\" src=\"https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/uploads\/reports\/1708438537-wiper-system-market.svg\" width=\"800\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Download Free Sample Report PDF @\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=S0lAgUkcqoM5CGJbi6yb0Pa2zu6zrLjfbLqjohuNrOUB5L8_EOvFM1Ft397w_-xuaPEcAtwn8p7-HSIrnMCSvmVTvc-z2SmruexUx3RoHbO7ThD-PGM582FNIIw_9u55WLmAg4XWQfolSxFuyXYOTGLS14FjI91bTtbcBHan0YlhRPjyhJe__rEaZB9uadhZOiXOGMHX4tKDGXU0L_x30F0Srr-LLEnR0ZOUaw_Y8Us=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/wiper-system-market\/request-sample<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Market Dynamics<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Growing Vehicle Sales and Production Accelerate the Market Expansion<\/b><\/p>\n<p>According to Straits Research, <em><strong>\u201cThe global Wiper System market size was valued at\u00a0USD 8.80 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 12.31 billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 6.3% during the forecast period (2023-2031).\u201d<\/strong> <\/em>Sales and production are rising in the global automotive sector. Higher cars mean a higher need for wiper systems as standard equipment. Following a decline in 2020, global passenger automobile sales rose in 2021, according to OICA data. Millions of new passenger cars will be delivered in 2021, increasing wiper system demand. As global urbanization accelerates, more people move to cities, increasing car demand. Urban drivers utilize their cars for daily commutes. Therefore, wiper systems are essential for visibility in congested traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Automakers must install functional wiper systems in new automobiles to meet strict safety rules. In November 2019, Toyota Motor Corporation and Weather News Inc. announced a cooperation research test on Japanese roads and surroundings using windshield wiper operational status and weather data. This collaborative study examined how weather and wiper data from connected automobiles could detect precipitation occurrences that could impair the operation of the wiper. These laws make wiper systems standard in new cars, increasing demand. Consequently, the wiper systems market trend evolves.<\/p>\n<p><b>Advanced Wiper Technologies Create Tremendous Opportunities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Advanced wiper systems maximize performance based on environmental conditions with sensors and automation. Rain-sensing wipers use optical sensors to detect windshield precipitation and adjust wiper speed. This technology enhances driver safety and comfort. Manufacturers are using advanced materials to make wiper blades last longer. Silicone wiper blades are noted for their durability and weather resistance. In cold weather, heated wiper systems reduce ice and snow on wiper blades and windshields, improving vision. Drivers in cold climates, including North America, Europe, and Asia, seek these technologies for winter weather solutions.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, many automakers provide automatic wipers in mid- to high-tier models to gain a competitive edge. In March 2022, Ford will launch the small Hatchback Focus in the UK. Rain-sensing wipers come standard in mid- and top-tier Titanium models.
