Portions of this story, soon to be pitched as a possible TV pilot, or movie was filmed &#8211; in part &#8211; on location at Fort Parker, Texas &#8211; the very site of the original incident. This exciting project is led by a talented team, featuring award- winning author Tina Siemens and acclaimed director Deborah Stone. <\/p>\n<p>Stone said, \u201cI really think that there\u2019s big things to come from this. I\u2019ve already had people come to me as thinking this would be a fabulous project to jump on board. I\u2019ve even had had some major people that have financed major projects talk to me about it.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>One of the most unique aspects of Post Oak is its connection to American history. For Siemens, this is more than just a lesson in history though.  Recently adopted into the Comanche Tribe, Tina Siemens has a personal connection to the traditions and stories of her ancestors and their connection to Quanah Parker, the last Comanche Chief. Her dedication to uncovering her family\u2019s history has led her on a journey spanning decades and continents. Through extensive research and findings, she has compiled a captivating book that takes readers on a thought- provoking journey through time and space. <\/p>\n<p>Siemen\u2019s said, \u201cI thought, this has to be recorded. This is history that\u2019s being lost if I don\u2019t write it down. It\u2019s just what my ancestors went through. My third cousin was the first missionary to reach out to the great Comanche chief in Oklahoma, after they were all forced to go to the reservation.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Siemens\u2019 relationship with the Comanche community has been a resounding success, with the tribe fully supporting and embracing the project. This collaboration has resulted in a project that accurately represents the Comanche people and their history, with many members of the tribe involved in the production as actors.

With her impressive achievements as an award-winning chef, successful entrepreneur, and talented actor, she adds depth and dimension to the Post Oak project. Her strong connections to the local community make her a true embodiment of the vibrant spirit of Texas. Audiences will be captivated by her engaging personality as she portrays a snobbish townswoman in the scenes after Cynthia Ann was recaptured twenty-four years later. Her character belittles Cynthia Ann for her uncouth and barbaric ways, adding an intriguing layer to the plot. Simmons\u2019 compelling performance will keep viewers on the edge of their seats, eager to see what she does next. With her charisma and talent, she brings an undeniable energy to the show that will leave audiences wanting more. <\/p>\n<p>Simmons is thrilled to have landed a role in this impactful project and is eager to showcase her passion for history.
