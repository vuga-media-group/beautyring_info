Russin expertly tackles these questions through his storylines and characters.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Tammy Ruggles for Reader Views<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>PHOENIX, ARIZONA, UNITED STATES, March 13, 2024 \/<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/\" dir=\"auto\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">EINPresswire.com<\/a>\/ &#8212; Celebrated with the bronze award in Fantasy by the Reader Views Literary Awards, \u201cLight Burns\u201d by Robert Russin presents a hopeful take on the afterlife by giving humanity a second chance. This persuasive fantasy novel takes readers on a journey through the afterlife with protagonist Dawn Allegary. Struck by lightning, Dawn transitions from her mortal existence to an eternal life, facing the challenge of reconciling her past to seize happiness and love anew. Russin explores the concepts of choice, consequence, and the possibility of redemption beyond death. This thought-provoking drama invites readers to contemplate the essence of their lives and the afterlife awaiting them.<\/p>\n<p>When asked about the personal and philosophical themes woven throughout \u201cLight Burns,\u201d especially in light of the profound loss of his mother, Russin shared this powerful reflection on faith and the human condition, \u201cFaith is believing in the daylight no matter how strong the darkness.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the accolades from the Reader Views Literary awards program, \u201cLight Burns\u201d has garnered widespread acclaim from reviewers across the board:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe author\u2019s style is natural and easy, but there is a philosophical thread that runs throughout it. The dialogue is engaging and realistic, which grounds the fantasy aspects nicely. I love how the author is able to blend the commonplace with the imaginative elements.\u201d \u2013 Tammy Ruggles for Reader Views<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGreat book! This book really made me think of not only the afterlife, but how I choose to live this life. Thought-provoking and an attention grabber all the way through. If you like James Patterson\u2019s Maximum Ride, this book had a similar vibe for me. Would highly recommend\u201d! \u2013 5-Star <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3Vc5gUn\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Amazon<\/a> Review<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSuch a phenomenal read! Very intriguing and thought-provoking.\u201d \u2014 5-Star Amazon Review<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI found this to be a new take on what the afterlife will be like. Not your standard all is perfect. Definitely worth the read.\u201d \u2014 5-Star Amazon Review<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is an amazing book! We bought several copies to share with our family &amp; friends. The afterlife, do you die and that\u2019s it? Does your spirit continue to go on? If we had a second chance in life would we take it &amp; be a better person? I encourage you to always keep an open mind, heart, and share this book with others.\u201d \u2014 5-Star Amazon Review<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLight Burns by Robert Russin tells a story that blurs the lines between life and the afterlife. This wonderful book revolves around themes of existence, love, and redemption. I love how the book fused details about the afterlife with emotion. I also love the descriptions of the afterlife; descriptions of characters transforming into pulsating lights made the story feel more real. A look into Dawn\u2019s emotional turmoil, especially her journey from confusion to acceptance, is beautifully depicted. The different characters used in the book and their individual struggles make the book have more substance.\u201d  \u2014 Chinenye Sus, Online Book Club Review<\/p>\n<p>LIGHT BURNS (Olympia Publishing 2023, ISBN: 978-1804390566) is available at Amazon and online bookstores everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<\/p>\n<p>Robert Russin has always preferred the imaginary world of stories compared to the linear grind of accounting and auditing.
