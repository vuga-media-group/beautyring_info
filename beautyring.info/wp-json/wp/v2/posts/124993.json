Instruments are classified depending on their effective range, material composition, size, and function. Various methods scrutinize aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument such as material, color, shape, the use of the instrument, the method by which music is produced with the instrument, the instrument&#8217;s range, and the instrument&#8217;s place in an orchestra or other band.<\/p>\n<p>Majority of musical instruments are easily classified into one of six major groups, including bowed strings, woodwind, brass, percussion, keyboard, and the guitar family, the first four of which form the foundation of the modern symphony orchestra. Four principal woodwind instruments of the orchestra use a system of keys, usually silver-plated, that when depressed and released in different ways allow air to pass through differing lengths of the instrument, resulting in notes of varying pitch.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, rise in popularity and influence of western music in developing countries are anticipated to play an important role in sustaining global demand for musical instruments. Furthermore, increase in interest in classical music is expected to fuel demand for musical instruments, thus notably contributing toward the musical instruments market growth.<\/p>\n<p>Technological innovation has played a significant role in the growth of the musical instruments market demand. Digital keyboards, pianos, guitars, and wind instruments are among the most popular instruments, and they can be found at local retailers, superstores, and chain stores.
