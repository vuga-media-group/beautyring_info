But this is simply not true, she added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really a shame that so many authors believe this,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cEven when the publisher moves on to the next great book, sometimes just a couple of months later, the fact is, you can promote your book for years to come and still get great results, as long as there&#8217;s nothing in it that becomes outdated quickly, like technology.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The key to sustaining any marketing momentum is to keep the messaging \u2014 and the mode of delivery \u2014 fresh, Stevens noted.<\/p>\n<p>Her suggestions include giving talks or readings at local bookstores or coffee houses; taking part in broadcast interviews; offering discounts on bulk purchases for book clubs, schools, businesses or other groups; and being active on social media. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe sky&#8217;s the limit, and anything is possible, so get creative!\u201d Stevens said. \u201cKeep your marketing fresh and exciting, and you&#8217;ll keep getting results. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cMost importantly,\u201d Stevens continued, \u201cif you have self-published your book, make absolutely sure it has been thoroughly edited. Too many authors try to get around that, and that is the biggest mistake they make. Never think that your writing skills are good enough to simply publish your book online. One mistake in a book can put a reader off, instantly. And, if that causes bad reviews, you will become \u2018stuck.\u2019 Find a creditable editor!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Stevens advises authors handling their own publicity to look for ways to make the topics of their books newsworthy, while avoiding hyperbolic language and fluff. And if they don\u2019t have time for self-promotion, they can hire a reputable book publicist. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cA book publicist can help you keep your book in the public eye; they can communicate with the media and secure interviews and appearances for you; help keep your story in print; and they can help you reach new audiences,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>The bottom line, Stevens emphasized, is that authors have spent years (in most cases) bringing their books to fruition, so they shouldn\u2019t give up so quickly when it comes to publicizing it. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf they used a publicist during the first few months and got little to no results, they need to consider the possibility that the publicist just didn\u2019t do a good enough job for them,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cDon\u2019t let your dream die because someone failed to get you in the public eye.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Lastly, Stevens added, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more gratifying to me in this book world than seeing authors get so excited after their campaigns kick-off and watching them on TV discussing their books. Many of these authors\u2019 books failed in publicity years earlier. We reignite their dreams, and it is extremely rewarding.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>On more than one occasion, Stevens said she has heard authors describe their excitement as like being a kid again on Christmas morning \u2014 running downstairs, getting on their PCs to see just how many media hits have come in.
