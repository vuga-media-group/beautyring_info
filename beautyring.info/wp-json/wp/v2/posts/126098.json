A few short years after his release for a fraud conviction Comisar is now hosting and producing the runaway hit podcast Scam Junkie on Spotify. As season 1 is almost finished a lot of big surprises are in store for Comisar\u2019s fans in season 2. The secret to Comisar\u2019s success is that he is actually revealing the secrets to all of his best scams perpetrated over the past 30 years. Comisar makes it very clear in every episode that these well kept secrets are only to be used for legal purposes. Comisar insists that these techniques can be used legally to make millions of dollars and influence almost anyone.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify, the worlds largest platform for podcasts is launching a free t-shirt giveaway beginning today to all Scam Junkie fans who listened to all season 1 episodes and request one.

We will be giving coffee mugs and baseball caps soon to show appreciation to our fans who have made Scam Junkie one of the most sought after podcasts ever.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nobody would have ever guessed that after con man Steve Comisar was released from prison for fraud in 2017 that he would become one of the most popular and successful podcasters in history giving away T-shirts to his fans. Maybe it is because Comisar is the only podcaster that is a reformed legendary con man, a bestselling author, and a Hollywood actor. Or maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s a charismatic, funny and quick-witted celebrity podcaster.<\/p>\n<p>The public may think it\u2019s all of the above as Comisar\u2019s true crime podcast Scam Junkie is getting more popular by the day.

Produced in partnership with Spotify, the worlds largest podcast platform, there\u2019s no telling how successful Comisar\u2019s podcast will get. So far, the sky is the limit. After the t-shirt giveaway Comisar will be giving away coffee mugs, baseball caps, and access lanyards.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify is the world\u2019s largest and most successful platform for popular podcasts. Joe Rogan is raking in millions of dollars every month with his award winning podcast. Con man and actor Steve Comisar aka Brett Champion, The Don of Con is right behind Rogan with an audience base that is growing by leaps and bounds every day. Winning awards like this will skyrocket Comisar\u2019s ratings even higher and make him more successful and popular. A month ago Comisar barely knew what a podcast was. Fast forward a month later and Comisar\u2019s true crime podcast Scam Junkie is topping the charts on Spotify as the public is chomping at the bit for more episodes.<\/p>\n<p>Molly Goldman, Comisar\u2019s manager says, \u201cHis voice is calm, confident, like a pilots. You immediately trust him and want to write him a check. He knocked out the first episode in one take. He\u2019s very charming and charismatic. He\u2019s also a classically trained method actor and he\u2019s very good at it. If this award is any indication on what the future may bring for him, watch out Hollywood, here comes your next star.\u201d Comisar is 59 and resides in Los Angeles, California.
