The hotel closures were mainly attributed to closures that were carried over due to the impact of COVID-19, and continuous effort to eliminate lower-quality and underperforming economy hotels. Legacy-Huazhu\u00a0opened 374 new hotels, which was broadly in line with growth expectations. Meanwhile, Legacy-Huazhu maintained strong growth in new hotel signings, reaching over 1,000 new hotels during this quarter, which reflected the rising confidence level of franchisees.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Steigenberger Hotels GmbH and its subsidiaries (&#8220;DH&#8221; or &#8220;Legacy-DH&#8221;), driven by an increase in the ADR, recorded restorative growth in Q2 2023, with RevPAR having recovered to 111% of the 2019 level.<\/p>\n<p>As a leading player in the hotel industry, H World has maintained a steady momentum of growth as it continues to seek certainty in a market full of uncertainties.
