One-in-seven (14%) adult SVOD buyers engage in this behavior at least fairly often, 5% very often. Of these adults, 90% typically cancel within the first three months of use, only 10% hanging on longer. On average, Moderate and Heavy Hoppers \u201cBinged &amp; Bolted\u201d 2.0 services in the last 12 months, compared with 1.4 among Occasional Hoppers. <\/p>\n<p>To determine the extent of app-hopping behaviors, Aluma assessed the regularity with which adults engaged in nine actions, the most common signing up for free trials or promotional pricing and cancelling before being charged full price, the least common signing up to watch a single live sports match then cancelling. Based on these insights, Aluma analysts segmented adult SVOD buyers into four exclusive groups: Non Hoppers, Occasional Hoppers, Moderate Hoppers, and Heavy Hoppers. <\/p>\n<p>Aluma\u2019s two-report series offers an in-depth profile of app hoppers, in general and by behavior, including the number and brand of services added and cancelled, and a detailed demographic profile of those most susceptible to such behaviors. <\/p>\n<p>About Aluma Insights<\/p>\n<p>Aluma provides research-based strategic insights to video creators, aggregators, and OEMs looking to master the connected TV ecosystem.
