Movie (in theaters April 5 - tickets are on sale now), Red Wing Shoes brings Mario's iconic shoes to life in a one-of-a-kind prototype. The only pair created was unveiled at Nintendo New York, Nintendo's flagship store at Rockefeller Center, in front of a crowd of excited fans on March 10 - also known as MAR10 Day.<\/p>\n<p>Red Wing's master craftspeople worked with the film's creative team to translate every on-screen pixel into a real-life stitch. Durable, natural leather and slip-resistant treads prove these are the boots of the super plumber, and mushroom-based, mycelium heel pads provide a welcome power-up to help Mario take on Bowser and his army.<\/p>\n<p>\"At Red Wing Shoe Company, we've been supplying long-lasting, durable and comfortable footwear that protects trades workers on the job site for 118 years. We were excited to deliver that same ambition and energy to Mario's Boots as one of the most famous plumbers in the world!\" Dave Schneider, CMO, Red Wing Shoes.<\/p>\n<p>Mario's Boots will remain on display for public viewing at Nintendo New York at Rockefeller Center throughout the month of April.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ASSETS <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/stats.newswire.com\/x\/html?final=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS91cmw_cT1odHRwczovL3d3dy5nb29nbGUuY29tL3VybD9xJTNEaHR0cHM6Ly9kcml2ZS5nb29nbGUuY29tL2RyaXZlL2ZvbGRlcnMvMVllTFRxdjg3T1RudW54OUFzUnVBZ0tuSnJpcGNsVExLP3VzcCUyNTNEc2hhcmluZyUyNmFtcDtzYSUzREQlMjZhbXA7c291cmNlJTNEZWRpdG9ycyUyNmFtcDt1c3QlM0QxNjc4NDcyNjgwNTQ1OTk4JTI2YW1wO3VzZyUzREFPdlZhdzBLejM0Um1yeVZwQ1R0YjV5cmxzcEgmc2E9RCZzb3VyY2U9ZG9jcyZ1c3Q9MTY3ODQ3MjY4MDU1OTkxMCZ1c2c9QU92VmF3MEdfN1BYVGFrRkgzNmxIMjQ2bk9kdg&amp;hit%2Csum=WyIzdTV4M3MiLCIzdTV4M3QiLCIzdTV4M3UiXQ\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer sponsored\"><strong>HERE<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Product Images (Courtesy of&nbsp;Red Wing Shoes \/ Aaron Rice)<\/p>\n<p>Event Images (Courtesy of Alyssa Greenberg)<\/p>\n<p>Making Of Video <a href=\"https:\/\/stats.newswire.com\/x\/html?final=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS91cmw_cT1odHRwczovL3d3dy5nb29nbGUuY29tL3VybD9xJTNEaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_diUyNTNEV1NFQjlUY0xiZzAlMjZhbXA7c2ElM0REJTI2YW1wO3NvdXJjZSUzRGVkaXRvcnMlMjZhbXA7dXN0JTNEMTY3ODQ3MjY4MDU0NjY5NyUyNmFtcDt1c2clM0RBT3ZWYXcxcU5OTk9ScmNqV3daN0hPaDVpZEdSJnNhPUQmc291cmNlPWRvY3MmdXN0PTE2Nzg0NzI2ODA1NjAyOTcmdXNnPUFPdlZhdzJsaE5qb2ZXRzRPUHJOSkpMOUFsclg&amp;hit%2Csum=WyIzdTV4M3YiLCIzdTV4M3ciLCIzdTV4M3UiXQ\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer sponsored\">HERE<\/a>&nbsp;(Courtesy of Red Wing Shoes&nbsp;\/ Dallas Currie)<\/p>\n<p><strong>SOCIAL<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>@supermariomovie&nbsp;@illuminationent #SuperMarioMovie<\/p>\n<p><strong>About The Super Mario Bros.

Movie (in theaters April 5 &#8211; tickets are on sale now), Red Wing Shoes brings Mario&#8217;s iconic shoes to life in a one-of-a-kind prototype. The only pair created was unveiled at Nintendo New York, Nintendo&#8217;s flagship store at Rockefeller Center, in front of a crowd of excited fans on March 10 &#8211; also known as MAR10 Day.<\/p>\n<p>Red Wing&#8217;s master craftspeople worked with the film&#8217;s creative team to translate every on-screen pixel into a real-life stitch. Durable, natural leather and slip-resistant treads prove these are the boots of the super plumber, and mushroom-based, mycelium heel pads provide a welcome power-up to help Mario take on Bowser and his army.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At Red Wing Shoe Company, we&#8217;ve been supplying long-lasting, durable and comfortable footwear that protects trades workers on the job site for 118 years. We were excited to deliver that same ambition and energy to Mario&#8217;s Boots as one of the most famous plumbers in the world!&#8221; Dave Schneider, CMO, Red Wing Shoes.<\/p>\n<p>Mario&#8217;s Boots will remain on display for public viewing at Nintendo New York at Rockefeller Center throughout the month of April.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ASSETS <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/stats.newswire.com\/x\/html?final=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS91cmw_cT1odHRwczovL3d3dy5nb29nbGUuY29tL3VybD9xJTNEaHR0cHM6Ly9kcml2ZS5nb29nbGUuY29tL2RyaXZlL2ZvbGRlcnMvMVllTFRxdjg3T1RudW54OUFzUnVBZ0tuSnJpcGNsVExLP3VzcCUyNTNEc2hhcmluZyUyNmFtcDtzYSUzREQlMjZhbXA7c291cmNlJTNEZWRpdG9ycyUyNmFtcDt1c3QlM0QxNjc4NDcyNjgwNTQ1OTk4JTI2YW1wO3VzZyUzREFPdlZhdzBLejM0Um1yeVZwQ1R0YjV5cmxzcEgmc2E9RCZzb3VyY2U9ZG9jcyZ1c3Q9MTY3ODQ3MjY4MDU1OTkxMCZ1c2c9QU92VmF3MEdfN1BYVGFrRkgzNmxIMjQ2bk9kdg&amp;hit%2Csum=WyIzdTV4M3MiLCIzdTV4M3QiLCIzdTV4M3UiXQ\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow\"><strong>HERE<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Product Images (Courtesy of\u00a0Red Wing Shoes \/ Aaron Rice)<\/p>\n<p>Event Images (Courtesy of Alyssa Greenberg)<\/p>\n<p>Making Of Video <a href=\"https:\/\/stats.newswire.com\/x\/html?final=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS91cmw_cT1odHRwczovL3d3dy5nb29nbGUuY29tL3VybD9xJTNEaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_diUyNTNEV1NFQjlUY0xiZzAlMjZhbXA7c2ElM0REJTI2YW1wO3NvdXJjZSUzRGVkaXRvcnMlMjZhbXA7dXN0JTNEMTY3ODQ3MjY4MDU0NjY5NyUyNmFtcDt1c2clM0RBT3ZWYXcxcU5OTk9ScmNqV3daN0hPaDVpZEdSJnNhPUQmc291cmNlPWRvY3MmdXN0PTE2Nzg0NzI2ODA1NjAyOTcmdXNnPUFPdlZhdzJsaE5qb2ZXRzRPUHJOSkpMOUFsclg&amp;hit%2Csum=WyIzdTV4M3YiLCIzdTV4M3ciLCIzdTV4M3UiXQ\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow\">HERE<\/a>\u00a0(Courtesy of Red Wing Shoes\u00a0\/ Dallas Currie)<\/p>\n<p><strong>SOCIAL<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>@supermariomovie\u00a0@illuminationent #SuperMarioMovie<\/p>\n<p><strong>About The Super Mario Bros.

NEW YORK, March 10, 2023 (Newswire.com) - In celebration of Mario&#039;s leap to the big screen in Nintendo and Illumination&#039;s The Super Mario Bros. Movie (in theaters April 5 - tickets are on sale now), Red Wing Shoes brings Mario&#039;s iconic shoes to life in a one-of-a-kind prototype. The only pair created was unveiled at Nintendo New York, Nintendo&#039;s flagship store at Rockefeller Center, in front of a crowd of excited fans on March 10 - also known as MAR10 Day. Red Wing&#039;s master craftspeople worked with the film&#039;s creative team to translate every on-screen pixel into a real-life stitch. Durable, natural leather and slip-resistant treads prove these are the boots of the super plumber, and mushroom-based, mycelium heel pads provide a welcome power-up to help Mario take on Bowser and his army. &quot;At Red Wing Shoe Company, we&#039;ve been supplying long-lasting, durable and comfortable footwear that protects trades workers on the job site for 118 years.

Movie, Red Wing Shoes reveals a prototype of Mario's Boots at Nintendo New York on MAR10 Day. NEW YORK, March 10, 2023 (Newswire.com) - In celebration of Mario's leap to the big screen in Nintendo and Illumination's The Super Mario Bros. Movie (in theaters April 5 - tickets are on sale now), Red Wing Shoes brings Mario's iconic shoes to life in a one-of-a-kind prototype. The only pair created was unveiled at Nintendo New York, Nintendo's flagship store at Rockefeller Center, in front of a crowd of excited fans on March 10 - also known as MAR10 Day. Red Wing's master craftspeople worked with the film's creative team to translate every on-screen pixel into a real-life stitch. Durable, natural leather and slip-resistant treads prove these are the boots of the super plumber, and mushroom-based, mycelium heel pads provide a welcome power-up to help Mario take on Bowser and his army. \"At Red Wing Shoe Company, we've been supplying long-lasting, durable and comfortable footwear that protects trades workers on the job site for 118 years. We were excited to deliver that same ambition and energy to Mario's Boots as one of the most famous plumbers in the world!\" Dave Schneider, CMO, Red Wing Shoes. Mario's Boots will remain on display for public viewing at Nintendo New York at Rockefeller Center throughout the month of April.
