(OTC: HHSE) is looking towards international co-productions and financing incentives to cover most of the $80-mm in costs needed for two high-profile original productions. The two principal films in the three-picture international slate for Hannover House include the previously announced family-fantasy  \u201cMother Goose: Journey to Utopia\u201d \u2013 and a new, major effects thriller which will rely heavily on A.I. software for many complex, visual sequences that previously would have pushed the budget to more than $100-million.  <\/p>\n<p>Hannover House is also in development or preproduction on three additional features that are set for filming with in the USA:  \u201cThe Last Days of Belle Starr\u201d (1889 western thriller); \u201cModern Antiquities\u201d (contemporary feel-good drama) and \u201cSenior Year\u201d (contemporary sports-drama).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMother Goose: Journey to Utopia\u201d is being retitled as \u201cJourney to Utopia\u201d due to the older-skewing nature of the story &#8211; despite the presence of the all-powerful Queen of the land being the infamous Mother Goose. Hannover House had previously attached Academy Award winning film legend Shirley MacLaine in the Mother Goose role, although her participation in the film is not currently confirmed.  The film tells the story of two teenagers who enter an inter-dimensional portal to end up in the land of Utopia. They must solve riddles to receive the necessary clues to enable a return to their Earthly lives.  With the participation of international co-productions and incentive funding, Hannover House feels it can readily secure bank gap funding to enable this film \u2013 and two other high-profile features \u2013 to proceed into production for 2024. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs we move into our business model of feature film productions and video streaming, we are embracing the benefits of working with production companies and funding agencies throughout the world,\u201d said Eric Parkinson, C.E.O. of Hannover House.  \u201cThe explosion of viewer support for premium video-on-demand programming has opened up new opportunities for companies like Hannover House. With the additional benefit of using computer technologies and Artificial Intelligence for special effects on fantasy and sci-fi features, we can achieve production values that previously would have cost over $100-million per feature,\u201d he concluded. <\/p>\n<p>Hannover House has recently completed its first feature production with \u201cWILDFIRE: The Legend of the Cherokee Ghost Horse\u201d \u2013 a family appeal movie inspired by the #1 worldwide hit song by Michael Martin Murphey.  The film also stars Chevel Shepherd (winner of NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d competition), Adrian Paul (of the \u201cHighlander\u201d TV series), Mo Brings Plenty (from \u201cYellowstone\u201d) and late film star Anne Heche in her final feature film release. This Hannover facilitated production was produced by Snowy Morning, Inc. and will enjoy a USA Theatrical release this fall before a premium Video-on-Demand launch in December.  The film was directed by HHSE C.E.O., Eric Parkinson.<\/p>\n<p>Originally formed in 1993, Hannover House is celebrating its 30th year of operations, and an evolution from being a distributor of third-party productions into being an independent production powerhouse. In addition to its slate of commercial features, Hannover House is also launching the MyFlix streaming service, to enable consumers to see over 15,000 independent films from a large pool of producers and film libraries. <\/p>\n<p>For more information, contact:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDESIREE GARNIER, 479-283-8318 \/ DesireeMGarnier@gmail.com<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Desiree M.
