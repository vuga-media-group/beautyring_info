They spend their days in romantic and poetic bliss, while Fin spends his nights tormented by everything he can hear that goes on and is said in Mia\u2019s apartment through a curious section of shared wall. Mia moves and ends the affair but sends a copy of herself to continue the relationship with Fin who can\u2019t help but want the original Mia back. <\/p>\n<p>His participation (Eidinger\u2019s) in this production builds upon a history of collaboration with Schalko as a director and screenwriter, as the pair previously worked together on Schalko\u2019s Me And The Others and most recently on Kafka.<\/p>\n<p>Eidinger is perhaps best known to festival audiences through his performances opposite Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart in Olivier Assayas\u2019 Clouds of Sils Maria which was nominated for the Palme d\u2019Or and again opposite Kristen Stewart in Assayas\u2019 Personal Shopper which was also nominated for the Palme d\u2019Or. More recently, Eidinger starred opposite Don Cheadle, Greta Gerwig and Adam Driver in Noah Baumbach\u2019s White Noise and has been recognized by international audiences for his portrayals of Reinhold von Rumpel in the PGA-nominated Outstanding Limited Series for Netflix All The Light We Cannot See with director Shawn Levy and showrunner Steven Knight, Alfred Nyssen in the European Film Award-winning Sky \/ ARD smash-hit series Babylon Berlin, and opposite Alicia Vikander in Olivier Assayas\u2019 Irma Vep for HBO. He (Eidinger) is currently filming in director Noah Baumbach\u2019s untitled (\u201cJay Kelly\u201d) film opposite George Clooney, Adam Sandler, Riley Keough, Laura Dern, Greta Gerwig, Billy Crudup and Emily Mortimer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLars (Eidinger) carries every role there is to play within him. For the role of Fin, it&#8217;s the other way around. No one else but Lars could play him. Fin builds a continent for his love. He is a kind of Don Quixote; however, his giants are the many faces of Mia. For Fin, much like Lars, everything is always about everything. I don&#8217;t think I could make this film without him\u201d, says director David Schalko whose previous credits includes Old Money and M\u2014A City Hunts A Murderer. \u201cI&#8217;m very happy we are going to look behind the knothole together\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBehind the Knothole is the most beautiful love story I have ever read\u201d, shares Eidinger. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t assume love, but approaches it like a strange figure that you first have to approach in order to recognize it. The relationship as the smallest social unit, from which everything that moves us as a whole can be derived \u2014It hurts beautifully.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Cinematographer Martin Gschlacht (Revanche, Goodnight Mommy) also joins Schalko\u2019s filmmaking team as Director of Photography. Gschlacht\u2019s work on Des Teufels Bad earned him a Silver Bear award win most recently at the 2024 Berlinale, with past wins for his work honoured at the European Film Awards and the Buenos Aires International Film Festival for Best Cinematography on Severin Fiala\u2019s and Veronika Franz\u2019 Sitges-winning and Venice and film festival darling, Goodnight Mommy.<\/p>\n<p>Superfilm recently premiered School of Champions, which Schalko produced and Kafka, which Schalko directed, produced and showran, and which has been praised by both critics and the literary world, including Booker Prize-winner Salman Rushdie who wrote of the biopic \u201cThis is the best dramatization of the life of the great Kafka that it\u2019s possible to imagine, perfectly cast, stunningly acted, and weaving the work into the life with extraordinary skill. It does a great service to one of the true giants of 20th century literature.\u201d The company also previously collaborated with Schalko on the smash hit limited comedy series Braunschlag, which was both written and directed by Schalko, and is the most successful Austrian Series from the last twenty years. His body of work has received numerous international awards and nominations. Schalko is considered one of the most prolific series creators in the German-speaking world.<\/p>\n<p>Fun Republic Pictures recently delivered the Slovakia\/Canada treaty co-production R\u00e9veillon and Cormican is currently producing with financing partners <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/volume.global\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Volume Global<\/a> the Michael Jai White action starrer Hostile Takeover which is filming in virtual production on the largest LED volume wall in Canada (and second largest in the world), at the John Hopkins Regina Soundstage located in Regina, Saskatchewan.<\/p>\n<p>Behind the Knothole was developed with the financial support of the Austrian Film Institute (\u00d6sterreichisches Filminstitut &#8211; \u00d6FI). The film will be financed in partnership with Volume Global and is being structured as an Austria\/Canada treaty co-production between Superfilm and Fun Republic Pictures. Lueftner and Cormican will produce the film which is written and directed by Schalko. Schalko will also serve as an Executive Producer alongside Superfilm\u2019s Katharina Theissen (School of Champions, M\u2014A City Hunts A Murderer), Karma Film\u2019s Anand Ramayya (Brotherhood, Funny Boy) and Volume Global\u2019s Michael Hamilton-Wright (Dylan &amp; Zoey, King of Killers) and Christopher Rush Harrington (King of Killers, Hustle Down).<\/p>\n<p>The film, which does not yet have an international sales agency partnership, is slated to begin pre-production in Canada later in 2024 and will go to camera in 2025. The rights will be represented at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival marketplace by the producers who are continuing to cast the film\u2019s remaining roles.<\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Amy Prenner<br \/>The Prenner Group<br \/>+1 3107091101<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/709952096\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/volume-global\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/volume.global\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=HBxBLeXUjvsE5ZwF&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      May 08, 2024, 19:08 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/709952096\/silver-bear-winner-eidinger-boards-schalko-s-highly-anticipated-next-feature-film-behind-the-knothole\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
