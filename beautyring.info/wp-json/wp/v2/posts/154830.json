Included in the totals are a smoke-free gaming space with 104 slot machines and a high-limit gaming area with 42 slot machines and four table games.<\/p>\n<p>Dining options will include a 24-hour restaurant with 126 seats (EE-TO-LEE-KEE GRILL), a steak house (Josiah Steakhouse) with 62 seats and a fast-service and carry-out cafe offering a combination of items from a coffee bar (Constant Grind Bistro) and pizza kitchen (Slice). An indoor event space with 400 seats for banquet events or bingo games, or 900 seats set up as a performance hall.<\/p>\n<p>In a first for any <span class=\"xn-location\">Seminole<\/span> <span>Casino<\/span>, the new resort will also include a ten-lane bowling alley (Brighton Bay Bowling) of 7,044 square feet with seats for dining.<\/p>\n<p>The complex will include the first hotel to be built on the Brighton Seminole Reservation. It will feature 100 guest rooms on four stories, totaling 72,000 square feet.

A joint venture of contractors <span class=\"xn-location\">Suffolk<\/span> and WilMen is managing the project. <span class=\"xn-location\">Suffolk<\/span> is a national, innovative contractor with a large footprint in <span class=\"xn-location\">Florida<\/span> and a wealth of experience managing sophisticated gaming and resort projects in the state and throughout the country. The long-standing custom, attributed to the ancient Scandinavian ritual of placing a tree on the top of a newly completed building, celebrates the construction efforts and crews that are involved with the project.<\/p>\n<p>The beam itself was transported to the <span class=\"xn-location\">Seminole<\/span> <span>Casino<\/span> <span class=\"xn-location\">Brighton<\/span> for current team members to have the chance to sign it to share in the celebration.\u00a0The onsite construction teams also had the opportunity to leave their signatures on the beam, as a proud representation of their individual efforts on the project.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today is an exceptional day,&#8221; stated <span class=\"xn-person\">Jim Allen<\/span>, CEO of Seminole Gaming and Chairman of Hard Rock International.\u00a0&#8220;A vision has truly become a reality as we placed the final beam atop this new property.\u00a0I thank everyone involved in this project, from the designers and engineers to the day-to-day laborers that are showing the world what the Seminole Tribe is truly about \u2013 unconquered vision, unparalleled service and unlimited future.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s ceremony marks a special moment for the Seminole Tribe of <span class=\"xn-location\">Florida<\/span> and the Brighton Seminole Reservation,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Marty Johns<\/span>, General Manager. &#8220;We can&#8217;t wait to open our doors.
