The Met Gala theme was In America: A Lexicon of Fashion, 9\/11 saw its 20th anniversary and the city honored it with grace, and the country came together over the weekend in a joyous display of unity thanks to the return of fashion week post-covid.<\/p><p>On September 12, 2021, Nolcha Shows at New York Fashion Week nodded to resounding themes of Americana emanating from New York City, with their VIP treatment of US military spouses, appearances from Miss USA Asya Branch, Miss Universe Andrea Meza, and Miss World Alissa Anderegg.<\/p><p>The vibrant show took place at 608 Fifth Avenue and began with the national anthem performance by Army spouse Deidra Lee Stubbs. Four designer brands were then featured on Nolchas runway for their Ones to Watch showcase, and cell phone shutters clicked incessantly as the sprinkle of influencers in the crowd marveled at the innovative looks strutting down the runway. Joining us was a very deserving group of attendees for a VIP treatment; military spouses. They sat with Emmy-award winner Victoria Konefal, NFT artist FEWOCiOUS, actor London Brown from Power Book III and HBO hit series Ballers, among other notable guests. Military spouses truly are the backbone of the United States military community. With long deployments, demanding training schedules, and frequent moves, being a military spouse requires a different kind of sacrifice than we know our service members make. These hardships impact employment, leading to a 38% unemployment rate for military spouses. Their VIP experience started with hairstyling, led by award-winning and celebrated hairstylist Gerard Caruso, followed by a \"glam session\" by Monique Rinard with AOFM, jewelry provided by designer Randy Luna, and concluded with front row seats, backstage access, and catered dining by Chef Tova.<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong>Nolcha Shows NYFW Presents the Following Fashion Brands:<\/strong><\/p><p>KavenLiu DIMOR SS 2022<\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_Kavenliu_Dimor%20S22%20042_1631637972.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV Kavenliu Dimor S22 042 1631637972 jpg\"><\/p><p>The 5th Season SS 2022<\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_The_5th%20Season%20S22%20042_1631638024.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV The 5th Season S22 042 1631638024 jpg\"><\/p><p>KLOVA SS 2022<\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_Klova_S22%20032_1631638059.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV Klova S22 032 1631638059 jpg\"><\/p><p>KOREANO SS 2022<\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_KOREANO-Jessica_Lugo-1742_1631638088.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV KOREANO Jessica Lugo 1742 1631638088 jpg\"><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><strong>Ashton Jewelry<\/strong><\/p><p>Colorado-based Ashton Burridge carefully and artfully crafts her jewelry designs, inspired by her time spent in Italy.
