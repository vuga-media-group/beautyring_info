In 2016, during a state-orchestrated public campaign against refugees and migrants in Hungary, the prime minister, Viktor Orba\u0301n, characterized them as a poison.<\/p>\n<p>Danesi\u2019s research shows that dehumanizing metaphors like these are so powerful because they tap into and \u2018switch on\u2019 existing circuits in the brain that link together important and salient images and ideas. In effect, metaphors bypass higher cognitive reasoning centers, directing our thoughts to focus on certain things whilst ignoring others.<\/p>\n<p>According to Danesi, the more these circuits are activated the more hardwired they become, until it becomes almost impossible to turn them off. The same is true of conspiracy theories \u2013 research shows that people who believe them develop more rigid neural pathways, meaning they find it difficult to rethink situations. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we come across a big lie or a conspiracy theory, it can shape our ideas without us even being aware of it,\u201d says Danesi. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cBy being exposed to particular metaphors, we may develop hostile feelings towards specific groups &#8211; this is why hate groups use metaphors to turn the switches on, so as to motivate people to violent activism.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, research into this brain wiring also shows that once people begin to believe lies, they are unlikely to change their minds even when confronted with evidence that contradicts their beliefs.<\/p>\n<p>On the contrary, these people will instead seek out information that confirms their beliefs, avoid anything that is in conflict with them, or even turn the contrasting information on its head, so as to make it fit their beliefs. For this reason, it is unlikely that people with strong convictions will ever change their minds about anything.<\/p>\n<p>According to Danesi, this can have devastating consequences. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen lies are used to generate hate, harmful behaviors tend to result, including violence and genocide against the target individual or groups,\u201d says Danesi.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe spread of lies is also becoming a powerful factor in generating political and social instability worldwide, destabilizing democracies.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Is there anything we can do to protect ourselves from the power of lies? According to Danesi, the best thing we can do is to understand the metaphors of the other party, and to examine one\u2019s own metaphors. <\/p>\n<p>However, history and science tells us that it is unlikely to work \u2013 research shows that once a lie is accepted as believable, the brain becomes more susceptible to subsequent lying. <\/p>\n<p>END<\/p>\n<p>Politics, Lies and Conspiracy Theories: A Cognitive Linguistic Perspective<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBy Marcel Danesi<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nPublished 29 June 2023\u202f\u202f <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n126 Pages\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nPaperback: 9781032393124| \u00a335.99\u202fGBP |\u202f$48.95 USD <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHardback: 9781032393131| \u00a3130\u202fGBP | $170 USD<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\neBook: 9781003349143| \u00a332.39\u202fGBP |\u202f$44.05 USD<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4324\/9781003349143\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">DOI: 10.4324\/9781003349143<\/a><\/p>\n<p>About the author<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMarcel Danesi is a Professor Emeritus of linguistic anthropology and semiotics at the University of Toronto.<\/p>\n<p>\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAbout Taylor &amp; Francis Group\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nTaylor &amp; Francis supports diverse communities of experts, researchers and knowledge makers around the world to accelerate and maximize the impact of their work.
