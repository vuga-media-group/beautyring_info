I&#8217;ve had a period of listening a lot to beatless ambient lately, typically right after putting my youngest daughter to sleep, calming down after work and family life. I&#8217;ve always had a place for both calmness and motion in my music, but maybe I have a bigger need for calmness now than 10-20 years ago. I&#8217;m a father of three children and I&#8217;m working as a psychologist, so I always have sounds around me and I&#8217;ve found myself listening to more silent and slow music than before, especially during the evening after a long day. On this album, this is also reflected in my arrangements.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I am surprised by how much more I prefer these new versions to the originals. I guess they attune better to my current state of mind. I hope this music can evoke similar feelings in the listener,&#8221; he adds.<\/p>\n<p>The result is an album that moves fluidly between naturalistic electronics and a unique dazzlingly otherworldly sound. The feeling is startlingly intimate, becoming both a sonic sanctuary for the listener and another world to explore. The feeling is bittersweet and positive, the sound is dreamy and electronic with lots of sustained tones and glowing atmospheres, and just soaring with no limits into other places. <\/p>\n<p>Agebj\u00f6rn describes his remixing process as \u201cleaving only the key elements of the music, and also working with different combinations of lowpass-filtering, slowing down, adding reverb, and mixing the music differently.\u201d Opener \u201cFour Hours to Karhum\u00e4ki\u201d exemplifies this. From a gentle piano intro, the piece swells to a sonic vastness both rich and austere. Reverberant textures drift through piano chords like wind through asperous rock formations. Subtracted Soundscapes moves fluidly between the naturalistic and otherworldly. Karhum\u00e4ki (in Russian known as \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0436\u044c\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a) is an industrial city in Russian Carelia.<\/p>\n<p>After the earthbound stillness of \u201cKarhum\u00e4ki,\u201d \u201cSwimming Through the Blue Lagoon,\u201d recalls Vangelis\u2019s soundtrack work. On \u201cLagoon,\u201d otherworldly voices shimmer across contrapuntal Berlin School tones. \u201cAs I Passed the Vyartsilya Border Crossing\u201d uses synthetic voice as a marching ostinato. When the melody comes in, it is both alien and familiar: the major key refrain of adventure wrapped anew in sterling pearlescence.<\/p>\n<p>His releases on Spotted Peccary Music include Mossebo (originally on Lotuspike, released in 2008 and remastered with SPM in 2019), The Mountain Lake (2011), followed by a couple of collaborations with Mikael \u00d6gren, We Never Came to the White Sea (2017) and Artefact (2021) with the related EP Space Travel. <\/p>\n<p>Spotted Peccary Music will live stream Subtracted Soundscapes throughout the day of release on its 24\/7\/365 streaming channel SPMLive: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/linktr.ee\/ambientelectronic.tv\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/linktr.ee\/ambientelectronic.tv<\/a><\/p>\n<p>For artist interviews, review copies, or promotional requests, please contact Beth Ann Hilton.<\/p>\n<p>Tracklist:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n1 Four Hours To Karhum\u00e4ki (Subtracted Version) 5:28<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n2 Swimming Through the Blue Lagoon (Subtracted Version)  5:08<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n3 Ambient Computer Dance (Subtracted Version)  5:31<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n4 As I Passed the Vyartsilya Border Crossing (Subtracted Version)  7:43<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n5 Sleep In My Arms (Subtracted Version)  5:41<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n6 Dulciter Somni (Subtracted Version)  5:00<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n7 Siberian Train Part II (Subtracted Version)  7:52<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n8 Zero Gravitation (Subtracted Version)  9:59<\/p>\n<p>Links:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSpotted Peccary Album Page: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/spottedpeccary.com\/shop\/subtracted-soundscapes\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/spottedpeccary.com\/shop\/subtracted-soundscapes\/<\/a> <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAll platforms: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/orcd.co\/subtracted-soundscapes\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/orcd.co\/subtracted-soundscapes<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSpotify: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/playlist\/2iGCVAGfKCTq0sG6nR5JGJ?si=0f9c46699f954eb9\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/playlist\/2iGCVAGfKCTq0sG6nR5JGJ?si=0f9c46699f954eb9<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBandcamp: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/ambientelectronic.bandcamp.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/ambientelectronic.bandcamp.com\/<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nTwitch: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/spottedpeccary?fbclid=IwAR3pf42FwFotW96qJNzDKbJXjCDFTsi2jRlHhjjiOCdSTH-qlfs4JUbiRRg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/spottedpeccary?fbclid=IwAR3pf42FwFotW96qJNzDKbJXjCDFTsi2jRlHhjjiOCdSTH-qlfs4JUbiRRg<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>About Johan Agebj\u00f6rn:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nJohan Agebj\u00f6rn lives in Lund, Sweden, where he is a psychologist, sometimes makes music, and enjoys being a father. He makes music in a wide range of styles, including electro, house, also solo piano, and has two main projects. His ambient music can best be described as \u201cambient electro\u201d or \u201carctic ambient\u201d; not too far away from the sounds of Krister Linder or early Biosphere. That is, ambient with electro beats, giving the music a rich atmosphere as well as a distinct forward motion. His ambient music has also appeared on several compilations, and draws influences from Aphex Twin, Pete Namlook and The KLF. His other project is a neo-Italo disco studio project consisting of pseudonymous female singer Sally Shapiro and featuring Johan as composer and producer. Their two albums, Disco Romance and My Guilty Pleasures, as well as a few EPs and remix collections, have been very well received. Influences include prominent &#8217;80s Italo disco artists such as Valerie Dore, Katy Gray, Savage, Fun Fun and Sandra. Johan also runs the Husmus online \/ CD-R micro-label on which he has released some solo piano works and singles. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@husmusmedia\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@husmusmedia<\/a><\/p>\n<p>About Spotted Peccary Music:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nPortland-based Spotted Peccary Music is North America\u2019s finest independent record label with a focus on deep, vast and introspective soundscapes.
