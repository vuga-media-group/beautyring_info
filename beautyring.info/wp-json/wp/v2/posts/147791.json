But each and every day play slips further and further away from our children, as play continues to be undervalued by adults as a necessary mental, physical, social and emotional development tool.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/playistheway.film\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">PLAY IS THE WAY<\/a>!  a film several years in the making, takes its audience to places they have never seen before &#8211; to countries considered smarter and better educated &#8211; and inside classrooms and play spaces where education experts demonstrate the power of children learning through play.  Film viewers will also meet successful adults who, as children, had the benefit of being raised in play-based systems.

He continues, &#8220;making an important film is step one, distributing the film on a world-wide basis is equally critical.  There are approximately 40 million elementary school educators worldwide, and approximately 3.2 billion parents , and our goal is for every last one of them to see this film, talk about this film, and help create early education revolution &#8211; change for the better &#8211; it can be done, it must be done.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bright Day Foundation invites everyone to begin talking about PLAY IS THE WAY!
