Comisar however is an actual former iconic con man who reveals his secrets and teaches listeners how to apply his techniques legally to increase income and influence others. While Crime Junkie discussed all types of crimes, Scam Junkie discusses only white collar crimes. Comisar uses his 30 years experience as a master con man and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0131409\/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">actor<\/a> to explain how scams are perpetrated and adds personal anecdotes and humor from his exciting life.

Comisar\u2019s show is refreshing because he is charismatic, funny and quick-witted. There\u2019s no telling how successful Comisar will become.
