Since their inception, DCDC has provided the industry with a cost effective and efficient form of digital delivery to cinemas across the country, now reaching more than 33,300 screens. Of DCDC\u2019s 3,120 theater sites, 130 are \u201csatellite challenged\u201d and cannot receive satellite deliveries due to line-of-sight issues.  These cinemas have been receiving content via physical hard drives.  To expand their reach and enable these sites to receive content digitally, DCDC has selected CineSend to provide their hardware and software solution for the Network and Velocity, A Managed Solutions Company (Velocity MSC) to install broadband connectivity.<\/p>\n<p>CineSend designed, built and operates Canada\u2019s largest terrestrial broadband digital cinema delivery network for feature film. Its platform transmits thousands of titles to hundreds of film festivals around the world including Sundance, Tribeca, and NYFF.

Velocity has been working in the cinema exhibition space for many years and has a partnership with ScreenVision Media, among others.<\/p>\n<p>DCDC continues to look for opportunities to improve services for customers while remaining the most cost-effective solution for Content Providers and Exhibitors alike.  For the last two years, DCDC has not only lowered prices at the beginning of both years but rebates have also been paid to customers of the Network, further reducing the net cost of delivery. With this partnership and expansion into terrestrial broadband delivery, DCDC is looking forward to offering an alternative to satellite delivery that will benefit both Content Providers and Exhibitors with increased delivery reliability and optionality while also eliminating the challenges and dependencies of hard drive delivery. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s great that we\u2019re able to offer an alternative digital delivery method to cinemas that can\u2019t install our satellite solution.\u201d noted Howard Kiedaisch, CEO of DCDC.  \u201cOur partnership with CineSend and Velocity is off to a great start as we\u2019ve already delivered our first major studio title via broadband after only a couple of months\u201d.  <\/p>\n<p>About Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDCDC was formed by AMC Theatres, Cinemark Theatres, Regal Entertainment Group, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros.
