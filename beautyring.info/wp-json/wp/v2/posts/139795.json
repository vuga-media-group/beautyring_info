This story, born from over a decade of writing and a lifetime of diverse experiences, has already earned a five-star review from Readers\u2019 Favorite, which hailed it as \u201ctruly a masterpiece.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>His current novel, although fiction, is the very real story of too many of us who struggle to overcome generations of poverty, neglect or abuse that have left us totally incapable of the life, and love, we desperately want. It is everyone\u2019s story because we all deserve a second chance. <\/p>\n<p>RUNNING AS FAST AS I CAN is a literary exploration of the human spirit, following the life of Daniel Robinson. Growing up in the harsh environment of mill slums surrounding Pittsburgh, Daniel&#8217;s sole desire is a family who will love him. Readers will embark on a transformative journey with Daniel as he navigates a tumultuous era, including the 1960s hippie movement, racial violence, and the anti-war protests at Kent State. On his journey, Daniel tries to make a family with all the misfits he meets on the road, like Bobby, who couldn\u2019t escape what he had done in the jungles of Vietnam; James, who struggles to overcome his heroin addiction; Elijah, who runs a homeless shelter as penance for his years lost in a bottle. But he owes his life\u2014several times, to Doc Samuels, his college mentor who teaches him when broken people lean on one another, both of them can walk straight again. <\/p>\n<p>Daniel discovers the enduring power of love when he meets Kate Fitzgerald, a woman running from her own demons. \u201cShe saved me in every way a person can be saved,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Daniel best described the healing power of their love. \u201cYou said my life was written in pencil, and I would get lots of second chances. That\u2019s when I knew I loved you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>John David Graham&#8217;s novel bridges the gap between literary and commercial fiction. Drawing inspiration from heartrending narratives like &#8220;Forrest Gump&#8221; and &#8220;Where the Crawdads Sing,&#8221; Graham\u2019s debut brings to life a traumatic period in American history while addressing intense emotional and social issues that remain relevant today.<\/p>\n<p>This compelling story touches on themes of family, redemption, love, and the pursuit of a better life. As the founder of Good Samaritan Home, a non-profit social service agency supporting ex-offenders, Graham&#8217;s experiences working with those seeking a second chance in life provide a profound and authentic backdrop for the novel.<\/p>\n<p>RUNNING AS FAST AS I CAN is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the belief that, no matter our background or circumstances, we all deserve a second chance.<\/p>\n<p>Graham\u2019s debut novel has already garnered several awards, with an Honorable Mention from Author Shout, and Finalist from the prestigious American Writing Awards.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis wasn&#8217;t a book; this was an experience.\u201d<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nLeta<\/p>\n<p>Goodreads review<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRobinson\u2019s struggle to be someone and be a better father than his abusive, drunk father.
