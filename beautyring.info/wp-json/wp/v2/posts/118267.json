People instinctually are driven to find their \u201ctribe.\u201d Living within a community provides basic feelings of security and, more deeply, feelings of connection and love.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, many people \u2014 especially children \u2014 feel they need to change themselves in order to fit into a group. But people aren&#8217;t destined to categorically conform to a standard of a group or title. We are made to be our own beautiful, individual selves, and to connect with those to whom we are drawn.<\/p>\n<p>With society placing so much pressure on children to determine where they fit in, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.authorjamiejames.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Jamie James<\/a>\u2019 newest book, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Perfectly-Imperfectly-YOU-Jamie-James\/dp\/B0BJ4RPFNF\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ZLGAEQZBH3U2&amp;keywords=perfectly%20imperfect%20by%20jamie%20james&amp;qid=1676344070&amp;sprefix=perfectly%20imperfect%20by%20jamie%20james%2Caps%2C85&amp;sr=8-1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">PERFECTLY IMPERFECTLY YOU<\/a>, aims to encourage them to just be themselves \u2014 to learn, feel, express and celebrate their differences. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cFrom your first interactions with others, you&#8217;ll find not everyone is for you,\u201d Jamie tells children. \u201cDon&#8217;t be discouraged \u2026 use them as opportunities to get to know the most beautiful person, the one you should be the biggest fan of \u2014 YOU.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Through Jamie\u2019s lyrical writing and Yogesh Mahajan\u2019s colorful illustrations, the book shows a variety of physical characteristics and personality quirks that make people seemingly \u201cimperfect.\u201d But as Jamie points out by the end of the book, these imperfections make everyone unique and irreplaceable, and the right people will see that.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere will be those who don&#8217;t like your opinions, looks, or you as a whole,\u201d Jamie says. \u201cCordially pass on their company. Surround yourself with those who not only bring out the best in you, but the ones who encourage you to be you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jamie has held a lifelong love for poetry and writing. Through her deep love and commitment to give her two children what her childhood didn&#8217;t have, she wrote some stories. Jamie wanted to write stories that weren\u2019t only easy to read, but also contained simple, universal messages to help children with their questions and concerns.<\/p>\n<p>Many of Jamie\u2019s books aim to help children embrace their individuality and feel empowered while also celebrating the similarities that connect people. In writing these stories, Jamie saw the reactions from children close to her and her passion was once again ignited.<\/p>\n<p>Her latest book is already capturing the hearts of children and parents alike.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I love about this book is that it delivers a powerful message in a way that&#8217;s accessible and fun for kids. The illustrations are bright and colorful, and the rhyming text is catchy and engaging,\u201d says Jen Duvall, vice president of an elementary school Parent Teacher Association.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOverall, PERFECTLY IMPERFECTLY YOU is a wonderful addition to any children&#8217;s bookshelf,\u201d Duvall continues. \u201cIt promotes self-acceptance and individuality while also teaching kids to be brave and true to themselves. I highly recommend this book to parents, teachers and caregivers who want to instill these important values in young children.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPERFECTLY IMPERFECT YOU is a wonderful, colorful reminder for children and adults alike: \u2018The things that might make you feel out of place make a beautiful human that can&#8217;t be replaced.\u2019 It can be a challenge not to fit into the labels we think we should, yet Jamie captures it beautifully. \u2018You, as you come, are exactly who our world needs!\u2019 \u201c  &#8211;Tracy Lefebvre, PCC, MSPP, Ph.D. Student-Human Development<\/p>\n<p>PERFECTLY IMPERFECTLY YOU is available on <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Perfectly-Imperfectly-YOU-Jamie-James\/dp\/B0BJ4RPFNF\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=23AK7LAH44M9U&amp;keywords=perfectly+imperfectly+YOU+by+Jamie+James&amp;qid=1676313262&amp;sprefix=perfectly+imperfectly+you+by+jamie+james,aps,80&amp;sr=8-1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Amazon<\/a> and other popular retail outlets where books are sold.<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<\/p>\n<p>In grade school, Jamie James dabbled in writing. Although her rural Ohio roots didn&#8217;t create an environment to encourage her talent, they did teach her work ethic. Through that work ethic, she landed in mortgage lending for 20 years. She spent 30 years in rural America before moving to the Atlanta area in 2012, where she settled down and had two children. After reading many children&#8217;s books through the years, she wondered if she still had the spark. She asked herself, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t I writing not only for my children, but for all of our children to address their questions, concerns, and problems?\u201d She grabbed a pen and has not looked back.
