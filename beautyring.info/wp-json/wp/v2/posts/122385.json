The clinic provides the AAPI community with a 100% bilingual staff to deliver high-quality, in-language care, removing barriers often faced in obtaining health care services. Sands&#8217; 2023 funding will help the HAPI Medical Center host community health care events to deliver medical and dental services, mammograms and vaccinations.<\/p>\n<p>In 2021 Sands enabled ACDC to establish the API Language Link, which facilitates connections to a variety of social services, and the 2023 Sands Cares funding will enable ACDC to hire more language specialists to ensure the organization meets the needs of the HAPI Medical Center and its other direct service locations, including a culturally-sensitive food distribution warehouse in <span class=\"xn-location\">Las Vegas<\/span> and a second community resource center in <span class=\"xn-location\">Reno, Nevada<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Both areas of support represent Sands Cares&#8217; focus areas of helping nonprofit organizations build capacity to increase their impact and assisting diverse communities in removing systemic barriers to critical needs and opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The support we have received from Sands Cares over the past three years has made possible\u00a0two tremendous service expansions, both underscored by the fact that language should never present a barrier to receiving the care and services people need,&#8221; <span class=\"xn-person\">Vida Lin<\/span>, founder and president of ACDC, said. &#8220;Sands&#8217; partnership is helping us make vital connections to ensure the well-being of the diverse AAPI communities we serve.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The HAPI Medical Center provides culturally sensitive primary health care spanning urgent care for acute symptoms, chronic disease management and preventive health care services, with the future goal of providing access to specialty care such as cardiology, diabetes, nephrology, behavioral health, gastroenterology and infectious disease services. With Sands support in 2022, the HAPI Medical Center provided free medical care to patients in January and February, enrolled patients in its financial scholarship program to cover medical expenses and hosted 19 vaccine clinics.<\/p>\n<p>The API Language Link offers support in 10 languages with translation specialists assisting ACDC&#8217;s service delivery for food distribution and assistance, health insurance navigation, citizenship applications, and voter registration, as well as at the HAPI Medical Center. In 2022, API Language Link specialists conducted more than 1,000 in-language meetings, hosted more than 350 community events, created and distributed 5,500 Chinese-language voting guides, and sent more than 270,000 pieces of in-language mail.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;ACDC is improving lives daily, while advancing the long-term health and well-being of the AAPI community in <span class=\"xn-location\">Southern Nevada<\/span>,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Ron Reese<\/span>, senior vice president of global communications and corporate affairs, who spearheads corporate responsibility initiatives at Sands. &#8220;The significant impact they have made with these programs is why we continue to invest in their efforts. Not only are we committed to being an ally for the AAPI community as a whole \u2013 we believe in ACDC&#8217;s ability to provide leadership in addressing the diverse needs of the many populations it serves.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sands Cares&#8217; support for ACDC is one of several engagements with diverse community organizations. Through these efforts, Sands aims to propel programs that remove systemic barriers and advance opportunities for underrepresented groups.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Sands Cares, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sands.com\/responsibility\/communities\/#our-program-sands-cares\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.sands.com\/responsibility\/communities\/#our-program-sands-cares<\/a>.
