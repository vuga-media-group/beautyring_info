RED CORNER is part one of the collection Primary Series and showcases the poem \u201cFlashback,&#8221; which is also featured in Fathom Editorial (Creative Writing Journal). <\/p>\n<p>The poet\u2019s raw and vulnerable tone explores themes of identity, queer and political issues, love, growth, perseverance, and navigating intergenerational trauma aftermath to crack open the cycle. <\/p>\n<p>The author is Creative Director for Vivid Illusion Creative Studios, a multimedia agency designed for artists seeking to monetize their art and expand their knowledge and abilities, offering recording, producing, publishing and distributing services, as well as a creative space to learn and sell creative artwork.<\/p>\n<p>Vivid Illusion Creative Studios has donated 32 copies of the book to St. Mark Catholic High School in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

The collection folds together the intimacy and the magnitude with which contemporary life is lived. The poet takes on a lot in the writing: abuse, trauma, mental illness, gender identity, sexuality, racism, police brutality, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the problematics of settler-colonialism and capitalism.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Adds Dakota Reed, Editor for Atmosphere Press &amp; Poetry Instructor at UOB, &#8220;Dawn has the ability to elicit unexpected images and emotions through rhyme and sonic elements without a tight grip and maintains a cohesive sense of a poetic voice. It forces the reader to feel and experience the sensations the writer experiences and writes about. It&#8217;s magnetic and pulls the reader through different textures and sounds, inviting them into a moment, in ways that are both uncomfortable and exhilarating.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Writing about the traumas of our childhood or youth is never easy, but in RED CORNER, Dawn Web does a great job of turning those griefs into poetry and not a kind of emotional venting&#8211;and at such a young age,&#8221; says Michael Martin, Ph.D in English Literature, Author at Angelico Press, &amp; Philosopher.<\/p>\n<p>RED CORNER is available on <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com.au\/RED-CORNER-poetry-anthology-1\/dp\/1738122301\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Amazon<\/a>, Vivid Illusions Creative Studios (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/vividillusion.studio\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/vividillusion.studio\/<\/a>) and other popular retail outlets where books are sold.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDawn Web is a queer and neurodivergent individual, born and raised in a small town in Ottawa, Ontario, and comes from a conservative mixed-race family of six.
