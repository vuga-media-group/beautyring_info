But they ended up being unveiled on the Olympic medal ceremonies platform for the media and world to see, at that moment becoming the most popular fashion statement of the 1992 Summer Olympics.<\/p>\n<p>See news documentation: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/amp\/id\/100165621\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/amp\/id\/100165621<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Immediately the public wanted to know <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.skullman.com\/index.htm\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">the source and where they could buy a shirt.<\/a> Initial stories incorrectly reported the Skullman<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> shirts as &#8220;Grateful Dead&#8221; or possibly being a team shirt. Neither is correct. These initial stories were proved to be incorrect and untrue. The fact is that they were never &#8220;Grateful Dead&#8221; which is a documented fact. But the jerseys that the team wore were actually created by New York licensor &amp; apparel designer Greg Speirs. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/30th-anniversary-iconic-lithuania-tie-121200691.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">The line is actually an independent line which came into this story created<\/a> and solely owned by the designer and not connected to any other entity. The band gave a separate $5,000. donation to the team as was reported in the news but was not connected to Greg&#8217;s Skullman jerseys. Speirs also owns the Official 1992 Federal Registrations of the shirts right from the beginning in 1992, from which all licensing rights originate. The artist played a much more significant part in the story than was initially reported and his name was pushed aside by the press in lieu of the preferred narrative and the bigger names involved in the opinion of many. When the T-shirts started selling and became a hot collectible Speirs saw it as a great opportunity to help the team and chose to donate all of what would have been his profits to the team. The funds weren\u2019t anyone else&#8217;s to give but his. As the property&#8217;s owner and Licensor, he chose to let 100% of his would-be royalties go to the team, at that point <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm3998173\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">becoming the major sponsor of the Lithuanian Men&#8217;s Olympic Basketball Team.<\/a> The reason why Greg was the major sponsor of the 1992 Men\u2019s Lithuanian Olympic Basketball Team is because the biggest sponsorship came from the sales of shirts and he donated 100% of those profits to the team. So any and all profits which were given to the team and subsequently to Lithuanian Children\u2019s Charities from the sales of shirts all ultimately came from Greg. He is called the major sponsor because the really big money donated came from the sales of shirts. All of Greg&#8217;s profits went into Lithuanian player Sarunas Marciulionis&#8217; &#8216;Sarunas Lithuanian Children\u2019s Fund&#8221;.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSee the news story: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pr.com\/press-release\/448933\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.pr.com\/press-release\/448933<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Lithuanian Slam-Dunking<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> Skullman<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> on Tie-Dye T-Shirts represented the artist\u2019s interpretation of a team rising from nothing, \u201cLike a Phoenix from the ashes to slam-dunking a flaming basketball to bronze victory.
