Organized by the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive, the Queer Rhapsody Film Series invites audiences to joyful communal and brave spaces for radical engagement among film fans, arts leaders and culture workers at a time when queer and transgender communities are under fire across the country. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe power of art in community is at the heart of this series,\u201d said May Hong HaDuong, Director of the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive, a unit of UCLA Library. \u201cWith our cultural partners, the Archive is grateful to the creative storytellers and film programmers joining us to offer a slate of compelling stories to audiences across the city.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Queer Rhapsody opens July 19th with a sneak peek screening at the Billy Wilder Theater at the Hammer Museum in Westwood. A playful and knowledge-packed documentary, Second Nature, directed by Drew Denny debunks the myths that females are \u201cinferior\u201d and being queer is \u201cunnatural.\u201d Narrated by Elliot Page, the film follows trans trailblazer evolutionary biologist Dr. Joan Roughgarden as she meets groundbreaking scientists exploring the 1500+ animal species that engage in same-sex sexual behavior and same-sex families.<\/p>\n<p>A kaleidoscope of offerings, the Queer Rhapsody series showcases contemporary feature films poised to achieve cult status, short form experimental storytelling as an alchemical guide, vanguard documentaries blazing a path for narrative change and international films primed to accompany viewers on a journey of self-discovery. Queer Rhapsody will present 15 film programs: 8 feature films and 7 short film programs featuring work by Robin Cloud, L\u00edo Mehiel and Nava Mau.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are in a pivotal moment where connecting beyond a singular institution to celebrate the queer experience as a multidisciplinary community is not only important but essential,\u201d said Martine McDonald, Creative Director and Senior Programmer of Queer Rhapsody. \u201cThis collective of cultural leaders\u2014curators, filmmakers, and iconic artistic anchors\u2014is deeply committed to sharing these profound human stories, creating spaces of belonging, and propelling LGBTQIA+ affirmation beyond representation to empowered narrative leadership.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Queer Rhapsody Film Series <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Tzy7x79g9fI?si=sbdZAH8Eu9GER5PY\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">trailer<\/a> showcases an exciting line-up of films set to the inspiring and magnetic sounds of &#8220;Beautiful&#8221; by Hey, King! the queer independent band led by Natalie London and Taylor Plecity.<\/p>\n<p>The Queer Rhapsody series will unspool during 15 events taking place at these five iconic locations: <\/p>\n<p>American Cinematheque at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAmerican Cinematheque at the Los Feliz 3 in Los Feliz<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nEagle Theatre at Vidiots in Eagle Rock<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nOculus Hall at The Broad in Downtown L.A.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nUCLA Film &amp; Television Archive at the Billy Wilder Theater at the Hammer Museum in Westwood<\/p>\n<p>The following Queer Rhapsody selected feature works represent the vitality and diverse breadth of LGBTQIA+ life: <\/p>\n<p>Feature programs at the American Cinematheque\u2019s Egyptian Theatre include the Los Angeles sneak peek of The Queen of My Dreams, from writer-director Fawzia Mirza and starring Amrit Kaur (The Sex Lives of College Girls) with the legendary Nimra Bucha (Ms. Marvel, Polite Society).

Exploring the nuance of queer friendship, best friends Lou and Esther are each other&#8217;s &#8220;chosen sisters,&#8221; but when Lou discovers she has a long-lost actual sister, it threatens to drive a wedge between them.<\/p>\n<p>Just in time for an Olympian summer, director Julia Fuhr Mann&#8217;s Life is Not a Competition But I&#8217;m Winning arrives at American Cinematheque\u2019s Los Feliz 3 and repositions historically excluded queer athletes to honor those who were left out of the winner\u2019s podium.<\/p>\n<p>Prepare for an afterlife-worthy Queer Prom party at Vidiots following a special screening of Darby and the Dead from director Silas Howard (By Hook or By Crook, A Kid Like Jake).
