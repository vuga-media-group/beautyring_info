The story follows an ambitious football coach, Walt McFadden, who is eager to sign the nation\u2019s top defensive end, Tony Raymond. He travels to a small town in Alabama, determined to make his mark as a rising coach in a place swarming with rival recruiters. In the process, McFadden gets caught up with Tony\u2019s dysfunctional family and is forced to navigate a series of comical misadventures.<\/p>\n<p>This film is full of humor, heart and grit and highlights the NIL (name, image, likeness) deals turning teens into instant celebrity millionaires and how college sports fanatics hope young recruits will take their team to a national championship game.<\/p>\n<p>National Signing Day has become a mainstream sporting event:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; 165M people in the US report being college football fans<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; The revenues from the Power Five college football conferences reached $3.3B in 2022 (more than college basketball and baseball combined)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; The SEC leads all major conferences in football fan numbers, with 54M identifying as avid fans<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Signing Day\u2019 will be produced by Glen Owen from State Line Films, Don Mandrik from Georgia Production Finance, as well as John Thomas and Kristy Clabaugh from SB Pictures. The production team is proud to point out that the film is completely homegrown in Georgia. It was not only written, developed and produced in the state, but was also fully financed by a small group of Georgia-based investors with NFL Hall of Famer and UGA legend Champ Bailey serving as one of the executive producers alongside Tiffany FitzHenry for FitzHenry Films.<\/p>\n<p>Georgia production and entertainment finance veteran Don Mandrik explains how this film is different from so many of the other projects that have been produced in the state: \u201cHaving worked on dozens of films over the years that were produced in Georgia, but written and developed elsewhere, I am excited to be part of a project where the entire creative process took place here in the state. Georgia has so many incredibly talented, native filmmakers and my hope is that this film will be but one of many to highlight Georgia\u2019s creative population of writers, directors and producers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The film\u2019s cast includes a talented roster of actors: Michael Mosley (\u2018The Sinner,\u2019 \u2018Ozark,\u2019 and \u2018The Girl From Plainville\u2019), Academy Award winner Mira Sorvino (\u2018Shining Vale&#8217; and &#8216;Romy and Michele&#8217;s High School Reunion&#8217;), and Rob Morgan (\u2018Don&#8217;t Look Up,\u2019 \u2018Winning Time,&#8217; &#8216;Mudbound&#8217; and \u2018Just Mercy\u2019).<\/p>\n<p>Writer and Director Owen describes the process of recruiting and signing aspiring college football players as a system that has \u2018spun out of control:\u2019 \u201cI didn\u2019t set out to write an expose. I simply wanted to create a film that takes a humorous, but clear-eyed look at what\u2019s happening today on the college football recruiting trail. The coach in \u2018Signing Day\u2019 is prepared to do whatever it takes to sign the star player but starts to realize that the \u201cbig-time\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily what it\u2019s cracked up to be.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>After graduating from the University of Georgia (where he played on the Bulldogs SEC championship basketball team) with a degree in film, Owen moved to Atlanta to pursue his dreams of becoming a filmmaker. He went on to serve as Associate Creative Director at TNT, where he turned out work for the NFL and NBA. While at Turner, Owen coined \u201cWin. Or Go Home\u201d for the NBA Playoffs. In 2004, Owen formed State Line Films where he directs national commercials and narrative branded content projects for brands like Mercedes Benz, Delta Airlines, Geico, Dodge and numerous others.<\/p>\n<p>Most recently, Owen co-wrote and directed the thriller STALKED WITHIN for Paramount\/BET. He also served as Co-Producer on the hit comedy, GOLDEN ARM, which aired on HBO.<\/p>\n<p>Film Synopsis:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nWalt McFadden is a talented football coach, but he\u2019s no good at the politics that rule today\u2019s game. Buried at the bottom of the Louisiana University staff and almost fired for failing to sign one of last year&#8217;s top prospects, he gets a second chance when he is sent to rural Alabama with a bag full of cash and instructions to do whatever it takes to sign the nation\u2019s top defensive end, Tony Raymond. Promised a promotion if he succeeds, Walt hits the road and soon finds himself having to outflank rival recruiters, grifting townsfolk, and Tony\u2019s own dysfunctional family.<\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p>Media Contact:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nElise Riley<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHead of Marketing &amp; PR<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nelise@myglobalpresence.com<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFounder\/CEO, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/myglobalpresence.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">My Global Presence<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.myglobalpresence.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.myglobalpresence.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Elise Riley<br \/>My Global Presence<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/675123208\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=C3vaiX9zgrMl4JvT&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      December 14, 2023, 18:45 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/675123208\/production-under-way-for-signing-day-directed-by-glen-owen-and-starring-michael-mosley-rob-morgan-and-mira-sorvino\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
