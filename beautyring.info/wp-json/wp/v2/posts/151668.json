Sripathi will lead Wyndham&#8217;s North American franchise sales team as they help hotel owners tap into the power of the world&#8217;s largest hotel franchise company and its iconic brands.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Amit&#8217;s deep experience in mergers &amp; acquisitions and capital markets focused on the real estate and hospitality sectors at Deutsche Bank and RLJ Lodging are instrumental as we increase our focus on growing our midscale-and-above portfolio while reinforcing our leading position in the resilient select-service segments,&#8221; said Ballotti. &#8220;Since joining Wyndham, Amit has demonstrated a strategic approach to growth. He&#8217;s helped divest our owned and managed segments leading to a pure-play U.S. franchise business and worked with our sales teams across the country and around the world deploying over <span class=\"xn-money\">$250 million<\/span> in development support for our owners.

During his tenure, Chip helped expand the Wyndham portfolio from 14 to 25 brands including ECHO Suites Extended Stay by Wyndham, the industry&#8217;s fastest-growing, new-construction brand launch. A champion for diversity on the franchise sales team and for owners, Chip was instrumental in creating groundbreaking programs like Women Own the Room<sup>SM<\/sup> (an industry first) and BOLD<sup> SM<\/sup> by Wyndham, which help make our industry more diverse while bringing new owners into the Wyndham family.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;From launching his sales career with us in 1993, to returning nearly ten years ago to lead our <span class=\"xn-location\">North America<\/span> franchise sales teams, Chip has shown unwavering commitment to Wyndham and our franchisees,&#8221; said Ballotti. &#8220;We are extremely grateful for his proven leadership and ability to attract, promote and develop a best-in-class sales team that consistently delivers, and we wish him all the best.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntac\"><i>Images associated with the above release can be downloaded <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/whgcomm.box.com\/s\/qjetpunghhcd8aa00a1fc6547f4z5mr8\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">here<\/a>.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>About Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts (NYSE: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ticket-symbol\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#financial-modal\">WH<\/a>) is the world&#8217;s largest hotel franchising company by the number of properties, with approximately 9,200 hotels across over 95 countries on six continents.
