With the help of books, a borrowed radio, a benevolent teacher, and a fortuitous assignment as a library assistant, Qin discovered and fell in love with learning and literature. Eventually, through sheer grit and perseverance, Qin won admission to the famed Shanghai Institute of Foreign Languages and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English and English Literature. With the help of family, friends, and a U.S. Senator, Qin was granted a visa to study abroad. She arrived in America with two suitcases and not much more. After winning several scholarships, she graduated with a master\u2019s degree and began a career in writing.  <\/p>\n<p>For the past 15 years, Qin has been a newspaper columnist and writes poems, essays, short stories, and original Chinese tall tales inspired by traditional Asian themes. Her writing is inflected with both Eastern and Western flavors in ways that transcend geography to touch hearts and reveal universal truths.
