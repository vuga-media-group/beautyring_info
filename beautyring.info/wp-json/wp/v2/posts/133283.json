It\u2019s called The Con Man &amp; The Cop and the reviews are very positive. Con man, Steve Comisar\u2019s, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/spotify.link\/sq7OPZXqADb\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Scam Junkie<\/a>, podcast will join forces with cop Ryan Horn\u2019s <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/spotify.link\/iEZAhZ4qADb\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">White Collar Crimes<\/a> podcast for The Con Man &amp; The Cop. This new concept has real life <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/steve_comisar\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">con artist<\/a>, Comisar, and veteran no nonsense cop, Horn, teaming up and giving listeners advice from both perspectives, the criminal and the law enforcement officer. <\/p>\n<p>The 80\u2019s blockbuster hit movie, 48 Hours, starring Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte was about a veteran street cop and a career criminal who team up as crime fighters. What made the movie so successful and entertaining was the great chemistry between the two stars. This proven formula of bad guy and good guy joining forces to achieve a common goal has been popular in movies since there were movies.<\/p>\n<p>White Collar Crimes is hosted by Ryan Horn with a career background in law enforcement. Starting out as a correctional officer Horn went on to become a probation officer. Scam Junkie is hosted by Steve Comisar a reformed legendary con man. These two combined podcasts on Spotify will offer advice from the law enforcement perspective and from the criminal point of view. Both agree on one thing. Horn says, \u201cIf you don\u2019t learn how to protect yourself again cons and scams, you and your money may soon be parted. And what a better way to learn than to kick back after work and binge a few episodes of \u201cThe Con Man &amp; The Cop.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As Crime Junkie the former podcast leader drops in the ratings Scam Junkie soared to the top of the charts as the number one true crime podcast focusing strictly on white collar crime. The brains behind Scam Junkie is Steve Comisar, aka Brett Champion, The Don of Con, a reformed iconic con man who knows a lot about white collar crime and he\u2019s sharing his knowledge with the public in his new and highly rated podcast. White Collar Crimes produced and hosted by Ryan Horn, a career law enforcement officer, is right behind Scam Junkie on the leaderboard. Crime Junkie finished a distant third.<\/p>\n<p>Michelle Jones, Director of Marketing for Spotify says,\u201d The reason Comisar\u2019s show is so successful is because he is a real con man and the listeners find that interesting while Flowers as a marketing specialist only comments on past crimes perpetrated by others. Comisar\u2019s show is refreshing because he is charismatic, funny and quick-witted. There\u2019s no telling how successful Comisar will become. His background in acting adds more intrigue to the equation. There has never been a podcast hosted by a famous criminal and a law enforcement officer. The public will eat it up. A successful podcast can easily bring in a million dollars a month in earnings to its producers and hosts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Molly Goldman, Comisar\u2019s manager says, \u201cHis voice is calm, confident, like a pilots. You immediately trust him and want to write him a check. He knocked out the first episode in one take. He\u2019s very charming and charismatic. He\u2019s also a classically trained method actor and he\u2019s very good at it. If this is any indication on what the future may bring for him, watch out Hollywood, here comes your next star.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Comisar is 59 and resides in Los Angeles, California. The first 13 episodes of his podcast, Scam Junkie, are available now on Spotify. Promotional t-shirts and other swag merch items are given away to all new subscribers on first come basis while supply lasts. A VIP subscription to Scam Junkie is $4.99 per month. Ryan Horn and Steve Comisar plan to join forces and launch their newly combined podcast, The Con Man &amp; The Cop, this month on Spotify.<\/p>\n<p>By Julie Roth, Celebrity Newswire<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Jennifer Gray<br \/>Celebrity News PR<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/659179572\/tel:323-493-3346\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">323-493-3346<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/659179572\/mailto:celebritynewspr@gmail.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">celebritynewspr@gmail.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Scam Junkie &#8211;  Copyright \u00a92023 All Rights Reserved <\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"qMxrm83SVfE\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Steve Comisar on The Live Show CBS-TV\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qMxrm83SVfE?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=SAwAlZ7SJgcQBMWp&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      October 03, 2023, 08:30 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/659179572\/opposites-attract-in-new-spotify-podcast-series\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"channels\" dir=\"auto\">\n        Distribution channels:<br \/>\n        <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/amusement-gaming-casino\" title=\"Amusement, Gaming &amp; Casino Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Amusement, Gaming &amp; Casino<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/books\" title=\"Book Publishing Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Book Publishing Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/business-economy\" title=\"Business &amp; Economy Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Business &amp; Economy<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/companies\" title=\"Companies Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Companies<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/education\" title=\"Education Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Education<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/law\" title=\"Law Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Law<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/politics\" title=\"Politics Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Politics<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/social_media\" title=\"Social Media Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Social Media<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/uspolitics\" title=\"U.S. Politics Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">U.S. Politics<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/world-regional\" title=\"World &amp; Regional Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">World &amp; Regional<\/a><br \/>\n        &#8230;\n      <\/div>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
