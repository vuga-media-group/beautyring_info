This is the highest honour awarded in the Republic of Azerbaijan.<\/p>\n<p>Gasimov was bestowed the title posthumously for special services in protecting the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and for personal courage shown during a combat mission. He had single-handedly defended a strategically-located church near Aghdam, fending off Armenian forces for several days.<\/p>\n<p>Gasimov\u2019s disappearance after being taken prisoner by Armenian forces was investigated by London-based filmmaker Karan Singh in his documentary film, The Son.<\/p>\n<p>The film used unpublished photos taken by Italian war photographer Enrico Sarsini, who covered the conflict for Russia\u2019s Ogoniok magazine. He was present with Armenian forces during their siege of the church.<\/p>\n<p>Sarsini was also present when Gasimov surrendered in exchange for the lives of Azerbaijani hostages held by Armenian forces. Sarsini took photos of Gasimov\u2019s interrogation by Armenian officers and soldiers, but then had to leave to return to Moscow. After Sarsini\u2019s departure, the young Azerbaijani prisoner of war was never heard of again.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud for Natig Gasimov that his heroism and his sacrifice have been recognised. This is a landmark moment for his family and friends,\u201d said Karan Singh, the director of The Son.<\/p>\n<p>The <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/tLEMe6JC7Hc\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">46-minute film<\/a> found out what happened to Gasimov, uncovering new evidence that pointed to those responsible for his disappearance, particularly retired Armenian officer Lt. General Vitaly Balasanyan who the film reveals was present at Gasimov\u2019s interrogation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDue to our investigation and film, Natig\u2019s fate is not a statistic anymore. Today he is Azerbaijan\u2019s National Hero,\u201d said the film\u2019s executive producer Tale Heydarov.<\/p>\n<p>The Son held its world premiere in 2021 at the Whistleblower Film Festival in Washington D.C. that highlights civil and human rights violations across the globe.<\/p>\n<p>The documentary was also selected for screening at the prestigious <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/miff.in\/miff-2022\/international-competition\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Mumbai International Film Festival<\/a>.
