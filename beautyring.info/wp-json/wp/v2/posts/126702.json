However, the pajamas segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 4.8% from 2023 to 2032, as the demand for pajamas for older babies is increasing, as they can start wearing them themselves without parents\u2019 help.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>The cotton segment to <\/b><b>maintain<\/b><b> its lead position throughout the forecast period\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">Based on material, the cotton segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for more than two-thirds of the global baby sleepwear market revenue and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period.
