The session offers a welcoming environment for participants to share personal stories and experiences while exchanging perspectives inspired by the film. It is an active component of the film\u2019s ongoing mission to allow residents to work together to improve race relations with an aim toward reconciliation and healing in the community.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cKnowing our past and its influence on our present can help us come together and build a stronger, more intentionally inclusive community,\u201d Calabrese said. \u201cIf we can do that here, we can show other hometowns across America how to do it too.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUNSPOKEN\u201d shatters a code of silence that has distanced neighbor from neighbor for generations. By tracing her journey as a small town Georgia resident, Calabrese uncovers buried truths and explores how the tight-knit community has been impacted by its racial divide deepened in part by the 1946 Moores Ford Lynching, also known as the \u201cthe last mass lynching in America.\u201d Sourced from 40 interviews with fellow Monroe residents and research over the course of three and a half years, the film, shot entirely on an iPhone, offers an insider\u2019s intimate look at the impact of the lynching, segregation and integration through today.<\/p>\n<p>Following three sold-out screenings and the first community dialogue session in Monroe, a unifying movement was sparked. Survey results from the first session showed that the majority of participants felt that the discussion challenged their assumptions they had or helped them understand racism in a different way. <\/p>\n<p>Attendees reported in a survey that the experience made them feel \u201cencouraged,\u201d \u201chopeful\u201d and \u201cmotivated.\u201d One hundred percent of attendees were \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d inspired to better understand racism, their neighbors and their role in helping our community move toward healing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUNSPOKEN\u201d won the Audience Choice Award for Documentary at the Macon Film Festival in August. The film was also an Official Selection for the Morehouse College Human Rights Film Festival, Chagrin Documentary Film Festival and Portland Film Festival in 2022. The film won the Documentary Feature Special Jury Award at the Rome International Film Festival in November and Best Documentary FIlm at the Reedy Reels Film Festival in February. <\/p>\n<p>To learn more about the film, please visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.unspoken.film\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.unspoken.film<\/a>.
