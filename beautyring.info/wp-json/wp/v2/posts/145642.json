As electric vehicle production increases, so will the demand for these advanced materials.<\/h2>\n<p>New York, United States, March  06, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &#8212; Thermoplastic composites are built up from structural polymer composites and formational polymer composites. These composites do not encounter chemical volatility since they use a thermoplastic matrix. After heating, these composites become softer and become deformable. And after getting cold, it takes its shape and can be shaped accordingly. Thermoplastic composites are low in density. It also has better insulation, better mechanical properties, and environmental resistance. Thermoplastic composites are recyclable since they enclose physicochemical materials. These composites are extensively used in crucial sectors like aerospace &amp; defense, construction, automotive, healthcare, and others, leading to the global thermoplastic composites market growth. The escalating changeover of long-established internal combustion engine vehicles (ICs) with electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) is likely to advance the global thermoplastic composites market.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" data-mce-selected=\"1\" height=\"406\" name=\"GNW_RichHtml_External_IMG\" src=\"https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/uploads\/reports\/1708438499-thermoplastic-composites-market.svg\" width=\"800\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<p><strong>Download Free Sample Report PDF @ <\/strong><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=fSY0aAcEXjPUxDyQFhOT_0wAbRxsnLCCkQO1Wh-4YkMPEj8C2kuQ_1886uXHolGD5thUmsRddJPqF3Hd1XVyLOY040kpyC7Lef-snaVp6pRaK5kONvoZ9K8Ic0OxUxhaRUZeeH9mCEidI8FucAr_GJFlD-K_HTCDftG-5EHlY3nP7qfsxIzhz9K1AvgZtgMEkPKiY9pabxF_uquqv9_7PPQqm9jCd8j2q5KhA6ckw005MFDU9l6ISdA6WWmrdEds\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b><u>https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/thermoplastic-composites-market\/request-sample<\/u><\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Demand from the Transportation Sector and Growing Use of Fiber Composites to Drive the Global Thermoplastic Composite Market<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Straits Research, <b><i>\u201cThe global thermoplastic composites market size was valued at USD 16.02 billion in 2021. It is expected to reach USD 27.55 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 6.21% during the forecast period (2022-2030).\u201d<\/i><\/b>\u00a0Thermoplastic composites construct heavy vehicles, rail buses, and automobile components. These materials are lightweight and aid in reducing the weight of cars, which reduces CO2 emissions and improves fuel efficiency, allowing automakers to meet CAF\u00c9 emission standards and other fuel standards demanded by environmental groups. Increasing the use of thermoplastic composites in racing and high-performance vehicle components such as instrument panels, front-end modules, door modules, roof components, appearance grade components, and under-hood components is one of the factors driving the thermoplastic composites market in the transportation industry. Demand for thermoplastic composites is increasing in all sectors, including rail. To reduce the weight of rail carriers, high-speed rail uses these materials for interior and exterior applications.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, ongoing research and development in various industrial sectors, including electrical &amp; electronics, aerospace, automotive, and wind turbines, enabled the development of high-quality and specialized fiber reinforcement materials such as carbon fiber, glass fiber, aramid fiber, and comparable ones. These fibers eliminated the need for heavy-weight metal composites due to their lightweight and other efficiencies. The initial application of carbon fiber was in the aerospace industry, which eventually led to its use in sporting goods, automobiles, and other commercial applications. Similar to how automotive applications propelled glass fiber into the marketplace, it now serves a vast array of industries. Consequently, the increase in composite applications drives the demand for reinforcement materials.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Increased Demand for the Electric Vehicles to Create Global Thermoplastic Composites Market Opportunities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Currently, people are becoming increasingly concerned about the environment. Electric vehicles (EVs) aid in the reduction of carbon emissions and are environmentally friendly. As a result, the demand for electric cars is growing to reduce carbon emissions. In the coming years, hybrid and electric vehicle sales are anticipated to surge. Thermoplastic composites are highly durable and reduce vehicle weight significantly. Therefore, they are handy for the manufacture of electric vehicle components.<\/p>\n<p>Several companies are currently engaged in the production of thermoplastic composite parts. For instance, UNITI SWEDEN AB (Sweden) and KW Special Projects will use digital twin technology and thermoplastic composites reinforced with carbon fiber to reimagine automotive designs and production. Consequently, the demand for thermoplastic composites is directly proportional to the need for electric vehicles. As the market for electric cars advances, so does the market for thermoplastics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Regional Insights<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Europe is expected to command the regional market while growing at a CAGR of 6.36% by 2030.
