It\u2019s writers like our PenCraft Book Award Winners who hold the power to shape the future of the literary realm. We hope that our endorsement of their endeavors will inspire them to persist in their work.<\/p>\n<p>In the vast sea of new books, it\u2019s easy for authors to fade into obscurity. In today\u2019s world, the journey to literary success is arduous and very solitary. However, winning a book award can be a game-changer, increasing visibility,  credibility, and setting authors apart from the crowd. Winning a book award has the power to transform an author\u2019s career, making them stand out among their peers. The win helps expand an author\u2019s audience and instills confidence in buyers who choose a book adorned with the gold PenCraft Book Award Seal.<\/p>\n<p>The PenCraft Book Award competition is an annual literary contest that strives to give all authors an equal opportunity for recognition of their works to the reading public. Its goal is to make the competition inspiring, fun, and open to all authors. Hundreds of nominated books are received for the competition, but only a small percentage win. Editor-in-Chief David Hearne stated, \u201cWe think our winners are truly the best. We hope to continue being a conduit to introducing new authors and their fantastic new books to the reading public.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>PenCraft Book Awards started with an idea\u2014from an author in 2015 who felt it was unfair that many authors were excluded from numerous book competitions because of who published their book or the prohibitive entry fees. So he gathered a few people together and set up shop to launch a new company that would allow all authors to compete on the same level.<\/p>\n<p>What PenCraft Book Awards would look like today was unknown, but the founders knew their commitment to empowering all authors to succeed\u2014wouldn\u2019t change. Since then, PenCraft Book Awards have bolstered authors worldwide, and they will continue looking for new ways to help authors achieve recognition and financial rewards for their creativity.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">David Hearne<br \/>PenCraft Book Awards<br \/>+1 409-656-4625<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/670464601\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/authorsreading\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AuthorsReading\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=jL-fVDnKjd9e4ubX&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      November 23, 2023, 08:10 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/670464601\/1st-place-nonfiction-winners-of-the-2023-7th-annual-pencraft-book-awards-competition-for-literary-excellence-announced\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
