Spiliotopoulos wrote and directed his first feature film, The Unholy, starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan (The Walking Dead), and the successful supernatural thriller The Pope\u2019s Exorcist starring Academy award winner Russel Crowe, with a sequel currently in production. Spiliotopoulos says, \u201cEdgar Rice Burroughs is the reigning King of Adventure. Through works like \u2018Tarzan\u2019 and \u2018John Carter of Mars,\u2019 he transported readers to distant realms and inspired countless writers like myself to unleash our own imaginations. I am deeply honored and humbled to be receiving the Edgar Rice Burroughs Legacy Award this year.\u201d Festival Founder Lori Morrissey said, \u201cWe are pleased and excited to be presenting and honoring Evan, an amazing screenwriter, director, and visionary in his own right!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Festival Tickets are available at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/itsmyseat.com\/TZIFF\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/itsmyseat.com\/TZIFF\/<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFor more information, visit the festival website: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/tziff.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/tziff.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p>Media &amp; Red Carpet Talent Requests: milleniumconcepts@gmail.com<\/p>\n<p>The Tarzana International Film Festival is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Jeff Rector<br \/>The Tarzana International Film Festival<br \/>+1 818-601-2082<br \/>milleniumconcepts@gmail.com<br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tziff.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=Lb0hBXVy7wXEhkoe&amp;i=ZK5qAQ9tNNrKUoEK\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      August 07, 2024, 17:22 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/733171307\/tarzana-international-film-festival-kicks-off-august-23rd-25th-with-world-premiere-screenings-closing-night-gala-more\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
