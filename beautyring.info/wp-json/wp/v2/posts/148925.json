said <span class=\"xn-person\">David J. Herrera<\/span>, president of Norwegian Cruise Line. &#8220;Expanding on our award-winning food and beverage program, we&#8217;re looking forward to bringing new concepts to life aboard Norwegian Aqua, while continuing to deliver on the variety of available offerings and value that NCL delivers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b><i><u>Brand-New Culinary and Bar Experiences<\/u><\/i><\/b><br class=\"dnr\">Making its debut on the all-new Norwegian Aqua is\u00a0<b>Sukhothai,\u00a0<\/b>the Company&#8217;s first-ever Thai specialty restaurant, featuring an eclectic menu with authentic, traditional offerings with creative, dynamic flavors. Guests can look forward to a new spin on traditional staples, such as Thai Cashew Chicken; Salt and Pepper Prawns; Thai Grilled Steak Salad; a variety of complementing curries and so much more. D\u00e9cor imagined by the <span class=\"xn-location\">London<\/span>-based SMC Design firm, the upscale dining venue will boast a harmonious blend of traditional and contemporary Thai design elements. When guests walk into Sukhothai on deck 17, they will be greeted with a warm, inviting atmosphere of bamboo and rice paper pendant lights; a striking geometric patterned floor; and colorful furniture transporting diners to the culturally rich country of <span class=\"xn-location\">Thailand<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>At the returning guest-favorite\u00a0<b>Indulge Food Hall<\/b>, a new eatery,\u00a0<b>Planterie<\/b>, will offer plant-based bowls and other healthy options. Located on deck eight, Planterie&#8217;s menu will include dishes such as the Southwest Bowl with smoked tempeh and the Mediterranean Goddess Bowl filled with delicious, spiced vegetables, tabbouleh and honey-roasted carrots. Offering indoor and outdoor seating, Indulge Food Hall will boast a brand-new design by <span class=\"xn-location\">New York<\/span>-based firm, Rockwell Group, with 10 food stations drawing inspiration from international food marketplaces from around the world. Notable architectural features include deep wood accents; gold and metal furnishings; and warm yet colorful tones that flow seamlessly throughout the venue.<\/p>\n<p>Also premiering aboard Norwegian Aqua is\u00a0<b>Swirl Wine Bar<\/b>, a contemporary wine lounge that strikes the perfect balance between exclusivity and approachability for a unique, intimate experience tucked away on deck six between the popular Whiskey Bar and Hasuki, the hibachi-style restaurant. The hidden enclave will feature a comprehensive wine-by-the-glass menu, and an extensive list of rare and premium vintages. Designed by the <span class=\"xn-location\">Miami<\/span>-based Studio DADO firm, the venue&#8217;s architecture is inspired by the captivating beauty and curvature of the geologically stunning Antelope Canyon in <span class=\"xn-location\">Arizona<\/span>, with warm color hues complemented by cascading horizontal lines and serene blue touches create a perfectly inviting and enchanting space for guests to unwind.<\/p>\n<p><b><i><u>Elevated, Redesigned Venues<\/u><\/i><\/b><br class=\"dnr\">From new designs to expanded seating, the all-new Norwegian Aqua will feature enhanced restaurants and lounges previously debuted on the Prima Class.

Relocating from mid-ship to the aft of deck seven, the innovative bar will now feature a grand piano and a small entertainment space for guests to enjoy live music with their Sail &amp; Sustain cocktails, biodynamic wines and sustainably produced liquors. Inspired by the art deco and mid-century modern areas of <span class=\"xn-location\">New York City<\/span>, Studio DADO crafted an intimate enclave with dark hues, eye-catching motifs and fresh greenery offering an easy-going ambience for guests engaging in a nightly beverage.<\/p>\n<p><b>Nama Sushi and Sashimi,\u00a0<\/b>which first debuted on Norwegian Prima and Norwegian Viva, will now feature a fresh, lively design by Studio DADO aboard Norwegian Aqua.
