However, the software segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 39.5% from 2022 to 2031, as it offers encryption and authentication mechanisms that further enhances the security of the network. <\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The non-standalone segment to maintain its lead position during the forecast period<\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Based on deployment model, the non-standalone segment accounted for the largest share in 2021, contributing more than two-thirds of the global private 5G as a service market revenue, and is projected to maintain its lead position during the forecast period, as is a cost-effective solution for businesses to upgrade their existing LTE networks to 5G. However, the standalone segment is expected to portray the largest CAGR of 40.7% from 2022 to 2031.

However, the licensed segment is expected to portray the largest CAGR of 38.8% from 2022 to 2031. This is owing to the fact that it offers a higher degree of security and reliability compared to unlicensed spectrum, which is subject to interference and congestion from other wireless devices.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>North America to maintain its dominance by 2031<\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Based on region, North America held the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2021, accounting for nearly two-fifths of the global private 5G as a service market revenue, owing to large number of industrial applications, the need for secure &amp; reliable connectivity, and surge in adoption of IoT devices. However, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness the fastest CAGR of 40.6% from 2022 to 2031 and is likely to dominate the market during the forecast period, owing to increased integration of private 5G networks with cloud computing to enable scalable and flexible deployments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Enquiry Before Buying: <\/strong><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=ZdJJ-I1WaUF_7HGTbYDi5xlnLA0lCqPTRNTjYyjxPriD3MLvqk6hn26REO42Cf4AdoQU9P76pggFvriokPVTX9ncaLYeO6Rox5sf6LtwKf8HW_EL0KpE7KE5YChdfNlBZKTZTkodbuyRJ616mjwk99zmwWm--RVd8r4wFM1lic-uYlugiw5GbM1ctiWhkmgh\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><strong><u>https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/purchase-enquiry\/74984<\/u><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Leading Market Players: &#8211;<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon Web Services, Inc.<\/li>\n<li>Mavenir<\/li>\n<li>Ericsson<\/li>\n<li>Cisco Systems, Inc.<\/li>\n<li>Anterix<\/li>\n<li>Infosys Limited<\/li>\n<li>Verizon<\/li>\n<li>AT&amp;T Intellectual Property<\/li>\n<li>Nokia<\/li>\n<li>Kyndryl Inc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">The report provides a detailed analysis of these key players of the global private 5G as a service market.
