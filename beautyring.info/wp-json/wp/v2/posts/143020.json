While the number of disabled characters in media continues to increase, approximately 95 percent of those roles are portrayed by actors who do not have a disability.<\/p>\n<p>The series, which critiques the portrayal of disability on screen in both new and old titles, discusses the multiple barriers faced by disabled talent pursuing careers in the entertainment industry. Listeners can access the podcast now via Apple Podcast and Spotify, as well as all the usual podcast platforms. <\/p>\n<p>Murray is a professional disabled actor and passionate disability advocate, who has starred in Comedy Central\u2019s Drunk Histories (2018) and multiple films, including Best Summer Ever (2020), which included Maggie Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ted Danson, Amy Brenneman and Mary Steenburgen as executive producers, and is the first ever SAG-registered movie in which more than half the cast and crew are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUsing nondisabled actors for disabled roles or creative teams that lack experience of disability can lead to inaccurate portrayals of our community and perpetuate harmful stereotypes,\u201d says Murray. \u201cThis podcast serves to not only illustrate this, but also considers where the entertainment industry has got this right, and how it has got it right.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a host of disabled talent across the US that is currently being overlooked for roles. Representation is imperative for us to not only further equity within the industry but crucial to enabling audiences to authentically relate to stories that are not their own, and this podcast highlights the uphill challenge disabled people face in being seen not only on screen but by society as a whole.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;-ENDS&#8212;-<\/p>\n<p>EDITORS NOTES<\/p>\n<p>About Acting Up w\/ AJ Murray and Crew<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nLed by Acting Up w\/ AJ and Crew discusses disability portrayal and inclusion within the arts and media, in front of the camera and behind it. It is led by disabled actor and disability advocate AJ Murray, alongside production artist Shawn Kimball, and features special guests from the disabled, and entertainment and arts communities. <\/p>\n<p>Centering around an individual film each episode, it includes discussions on movies such as; Champions, a 2023 sports comedy-drama featuring Woody Harrelson as the coach of a team of basketball players with intellectual disabilities; Music, a musical drama about a young girl with autism, directed by Sia; and Academy Award winning My Left Foot, about an artist with cerebral palsy played by Daniel Day-Lewis. <\/p>\n<p>For more information visit: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/actingupwithaj.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/actingupwithaj.com\/<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>About AJ Murray<\/p>\n<p>Hailing from Atlanta, GA, AJ Murray is an actor and disability advocate, with over a decade of experience in theater and film.
