Ron Hubbard Theatre<\/a> celebrated three art forms\u2014writing, illustration, and acting\u2014in recognition of four decades of L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s Writers and Illustrators of the Future Contests. The winning writers and illustrators of the international competitions, who were flown out to Hollywood for a workshop and awards gala, were treated to a unique live radio-theater production of L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s \u201cThe Last Drop\u201d Tuesday, April 23 as part of the week-long activities.<\/p>\n<p>Originally published in the November 1941 issue of Astonishing Stories, &#8220;The Last Drop&#8221; is a humorous tale about a New York bartender who mysteriously receives a special potion from Borneo, which can make people grow or shrink depending on which one they drink. When the story hero uses the potion to deal with some unfriendly mobsters, the results are comic and riotously unpredictable, especially when performed by seasoned film, television, and voice actors Bill Kates (\u201cHorizon Forbidden West\u201d), Jim Meskimen (\u201cThe Grinch,\u201d \u201cApollo 13\u201d), Phil Proctor (\u201cMonsters, Inc.,\u201d \u201cToy Story\u201d), and Robert F. Daley (\u201cDungeons &amp; Dragons\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>The L. Ron Hubbard Theatre was established in 1997, dedicated to providing a taste of authentic golden age Hollywood. The evening\u2019s performance enabled attendees to experience why radio theatre was one of America\u2019s most popular forms of entertainment before television came into existence in the mid-twentieth century.<\/p>\n<p>The L. Ron Hubbard Theatre brings the written works of Mr. Hubbard to life, fusing the art of literature, illustration, and theatrical performance. The 24 winners, along with Contest judges of the Writers and Illustrator of the Future, were enthralled by the performers\u2019 ability to bring a story to life. Lance Robinson, a writer winner from Canada, said, \u201cThe actors&#8217; voices are like paint brushes \u2013 the way they speak and do the voices so beautifully.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After the performance, Lezli Robyn, Editor of Galaxy\u2019s Edge and assistant publisher for Arc Manor, stated, \u201cI just closed my eyes and completely enjoyed this funny story.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Writer Contest Coordinating Judge and New York Times bestselling author Jody Lynn Nye stated, \u201cWe were thrilled by all this. I love the story. It was very funny. I love Hubbard\u2019s humor.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>L. Ron Hubbard created the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.writersofthefuture.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Writers of the Future<\/a> <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.writersofthefuture.com\/enter-writer-contest\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Writing Contest<\/a> in 1983 to provide \u201ca means for new and budding writers to have a chance for their creative efforts to be seen and acknowledged.\u201d Based on its success, its sister contest, Illustrators of the Future, was created five years later to provide that same opportunity for aspiring artists.<\/p>\n<p>The intensive mentoring process has proven very successful. The 559 winners and published finalists of the Writing Contest have published over 8,000 novels and short stories. In addition, they have produced 36 New York Times bestsellers, and their works have sold over 60 million copies.<\/p>\n<p>The 406 past winners of the Illustrating Contest have produced over 700 book and magazine covers, 518 comic books, and 131 major motion pictures, gaming feature films, TV shows, and documentaries.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on the Writers and Illustrators of the Future, go to <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.writersofthefuture.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.writersofthefuture.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">John Goodwin<br \/>Author Services, Inc.<br \/>+1 323-466-3310<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/708780686\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/WotFContest\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WotFContest\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/john-goodwin-8b2ab18\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/WOTFContest\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/WritersoftheFuture\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@wotfcontest\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">TikTok<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=74yKuBMTzf5v0FC7&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      May 03, 2024, 23:35 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/708780686\/award-winning-writers-and-illustrators-of-the-future-combine-with-the-world-of-live-theatre\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
