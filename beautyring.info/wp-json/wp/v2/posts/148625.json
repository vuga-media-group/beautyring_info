They had to decide whether to surrender to it to preserve their families, as Miskaw\u2019s mother aspired to, or to rebel, as circumstances forced her son.  Their perspectives showed how complex and universal the problem  is.  Today, in several regions,  entire cultures are under even more violent attack.  It seems few learn from all the cautionary tales history provides, which this historical novel is one.<\/p>\n<p>Curt Orloff has been writing books for five decades, fueled by his passion for storytelling. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in history and another in geology, inspired by people and ancient times. &#8220;Thunder in the Wind&#8221; was born from having been steeped in Indian lore, from  growing up on flood plains the Calumet Indians hunted in, living  close by  prophet\u2019s town, and being an eagle Boy Scout,  Advancement in the Scouts mirror Indian age societies.  Geologic fieldwork in the West introduced to him to plains Indians. There, he learned how similar the Cree Almighty Voice was uniting regional tribes to that of the Shawnee Tecumseh, who Curt knew about since childhood.<\/p>\n<p>A book about rebellion, acceptance, and family, it&#8217;s a valuable addition to anyone\u2019s reading list. Discover the challenges, cultural exploitation, and hardships faced by indigenous peoples striving to maintain their heritage within the culture foisted on them.  <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Thunder in the Wind&#8221; is available now at leading bookstores and online retailers, promising to captivate readers with its profound message and compelling storytelling. <\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t miss the chance to get a copy of this book at the upcoming LA TIMES Festival of Books on April 20th and 21st, 2024, at the University of Southern California campus.
