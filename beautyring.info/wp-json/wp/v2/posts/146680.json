Gibb\u2019s novel takes home the gold award, an award honored with a cash prize and special marketing promotions. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Where the Grass Grows Blue&#8221; follows the journey of Penny Crenshaw, a mother of three who faces significant challenges, including her divorce, her grandmother&#8217;s death, and revisiting her childhood home in Kentucky. Despite her initial intention to deal swiftly with her grandmother&#8217;s estate, Penny&#8217;s encounter with her former love, Bradley Hitchens, complicates matters. The story reaches into Penny&#8217;s past, revealing themes of abuse, tragedy, and resilience, while also exploring her evolving relationship with Bradley. Through flashbacks and introspection, readers witness Penny&#8217;s character development and the complexities of her emotions as she navigates through love, trust, and self-discovery in the midst of life&#8217;s trials and tribulations.<\/p>\n<p>Stephanie Elizabeth Long with Reader Views said of the story, \u201cWhere the Grass Grows Blue was a page-turner from the beginning. The author\u2019s writing was like paint on a canvas, creating a vibrant picture of life in Kentucky, so much so that I was easily transported there. A charming story about heartbreak and resilience with a bit of romance sprinkled in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am grateful beyond words for Reader Views&#8217; support of my debut novel from the very beginning and the amazing platform they provide for authors like myself to share our stories with the world. This recognition is deeply humbling and serves as a motivating reminder that storytelling is a collaborative journey. Thank you, Reader Views, for honoring Where the Grass Grows Blue.\u201d &#8212; Hope Gibbs<\/p>\n<p>Where the Grass Grows Blue (ISBN: 979-8212377706, Red Adept Publishing (2023) is available at online bookstores everywhere. <\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<\/p>\n<p>Hope Gibbs grew up in rural Scottsville, Kentucky.
