I cannot wait for guests to discover this luxurious private sanctuary and truly transformative experience.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Red Sea, one of the <span class=\"xn-location\">Kingdom of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s<\/span> luxury regenerative tourism destinations on the west coast of the country, is surrounded by the world&#8217;s fourth-largest barrier reef system with an archipelago of more than 90 untouched islands. From this enchanting setting, guests can embark on extraordinary snorkelling and scuba diving adventures to uncover seldom visited sites beneath the waves. Teeming with vibrant coral reefs that have thrived for over five thousand years, the barrier reef is home to fascinating ecosystems including over 165 endemic reef fish, dolphins, sea turtles, stingrays, and Napoleon wrasse.<\/p>\n<p>The island&#8217;s shores are fringed by rich mangroves, known to be one of the\u202fmost productive ecosystems in the world, and\u00a0within this lush habitat visitors can spot a variety of sea birds, marine invertebrates and havali guitarfish. Beyond the turquoise waters, guests can discover the beauty of the coastal mainland through guided trails across majestic desert dunes.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Designed by Foster and Partners, Nujuma&#8217;s sweeping shell-inspired architecture and elegant interiors are crafted with natural materials imbued with calming sea and sand tones, and geometric patterns reminiscent of the region&#8217;s design motifs. Arabic artifacts, traditional ceramics, woven Saudi patterned rugs and intricate wall hangings celebrating local craftmanship flow through the canopied interiors. Lush landscaping of indigenous plants elegantly frame the pathways between the pavilioned spaces and villas.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Accessed by chartered boat or seaplane, Nujuma features 63 overwater and beach villas, offering one-to-three-bedroom accommodation, spacious living areas and private pools overlooking the sea. Guests can marvel at the limitless starry night skies from the comfort of their villa through telescopes positioned on each deck.\u00a0Perched above the cerulean-blue sea and connected by an elevated ring walkway, the overwater villas offer panoramic views and direct access to the sea. Nestled on undisturbed soft white sand, the beach villas are secluded retreats flooded with natural light and the sea&#8217;s refreshing breeze. Each villa enjoys the services of a dedicated personal host, who will take care of every detail and guide guests through all the enriching experiences this destination has to offer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Opportunity to gain unique insights into the Saudi Arabian culture, traditions and the destination are presented by a team of local experts dedicated to preserving and sharing their heritage.\u00a0Honouring the legacy of nomadic exploration and learning, the <b>Conservation House<\/b> is an integrated space for creative pursuits to expand knowledge and foster a sense of community. Through hands-on activities hosted by resident sustainability, environmental, and cultural experts, guests of all ages can cultivate a deep connection with the destination.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Nujuma&#8217;s dining philosophy is inspired by the Arabian tradition of gathering at one&#8217;s home to share stories of good fortune, poetry, philosophy and science. Each of the Reserve&#8217;s five culinary experiences honour the generations of fishermen from the Umluj region whose lives have been deeply intertwined with the area for over 50 years. Guests are warmly welcomed to <b>Tabrah<\/b>, a modern interpretation of a fisherman&#8217;s home, to share a menu of seafood specialities including, &#8216;The Luckiest Catch&#8217;, a communal celebration of the sea&#8217;s daily bounty that has nurtured the fisherman&#8217;s family through the ages. <b>Jamaa<\/b> is a relaxed alfresco space serving light dishes prepared in an open kitchen and over a wood-fire grill to the resort&#8217;s outdoor pool and beach lined with plush cabanas.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>As the sun dips below the horizon, <b>Maia<\/b> is an intimate place for astrology inspired refreshments prepared by expert mixologists, including &#8216;Gemini&#8217;, a citrus mocktail named after the constellation, known as al-Taw&#8217;am\u00e2n in Arabic, that can be seen from\u00a0Saudi Arabia&#8217;s capital all year. Designed to celebrate the wonders of the night&#8217;s sky featuring telescope and star design elements, the open-air terrace is a place to gaze above while Nujuma&#8217;s astrologer shares insights into the evening&#8217;s constellation.
