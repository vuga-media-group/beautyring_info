This rebroadcast will correspond with the United States observance of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day. At the time, she represented the First Congressional District of New Mexico, which includes most of Albuquerque and its suburbs, and she was one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress\u2014the other is Sharice Davids of Kansas. Shortly after this episode was aired, Haaland was nominated by the Biden administration to serve as the Secretary of the Interior, now making her the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary.<\/p>\n<p>Also on the interview is Sally Roesch Wagner. Dr. Wagner is a feminist pioneer, speaker, activist, and the author of several books, including &#8220;Sisters in Spirit: Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Influence on Early American Feminists&#8221;, and &#8220;The Women\u2019s Suffrage Movement&#8221;. Dr. Wagner was among the first persons ever to receive a PhD for work in Women\u2019s Studies from UC Santa Cruz and was the founder of one of the first college-level women\u2019s studies programs in the country. Sally appeared in the Ken Burns PBS documentary &#8220;Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony&#8221;, for which she wrote the accompanying faculty guide for PBS. She was also a historian in the PBS special &#8220;One Woman, One Vote&#8221;, and has been interviewed on NPR\u2019s &#8220;All Things Considered&#8221; and &#8220;Democracy Now&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The subject of this discussion was the \u201cNative American Influence on the Founding Mothers.\u201d In other words, how did the Native American cultures inspire the thinking of the \u2018founding mothers\u2019, women such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and Matilda Gage who were outspoken voices for women\u2019s\u2019 rights during the formative years of the United States. These women paid taxes but could not vote, could not run for office, had no right of divorce, and should they separate from their husband, were returned to them by police like runaway slaves. Native women, on the other hand, were fully equal in their society and played an integral role in political affairs and in keeping harmony with nature.<\/p>\n<p>The host of the &#8220;Circle for Original Thinking&#8221; podcast, Glenn Aparicio Parry, has long pointed out that the most significant forgotten piece of America\u2019s legacy is the profound effect Native America had on the founding values of this nation. His book Original Politics: Making America Sacred Again demonstrates how the best aspects of the founding vision of America were inspired, or directly appropriated, from living, Native American cultures: concepts such as natural rights, liberty, and egalitarian justice. Further, Parry traces the influence of Native America not only on the founding fathers, but on the \u2018founding mothers\u2019 of the 19th century women\u2019s movement; as well as the 19th century abolitionist and modern ecological movements. <\/p>\n<p>The re-broadcast will take place on Monday, October 9, 2023 concurrent with the observance of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day in the United States. The commemoration has been officially adopted by nineteen states plus the District of Columbia, as well as 130 cities nationwide. In 2021, President Biden was the first president to officially commemorate the day, though it remains unadopted as a federal holiday.<\/p>\n<p>The Indigenous peoples of the Americas are a large and extremely varied group of cultures spanning a massive territory from the lower tip of South America, near the Antarctic Ocean up into the Arctic Circle with the Northern areas of Canada, Greenland, and Alaska. The societies that emerged from these populations date back over 10,000 years and they represent a wide scope of social organizations from tribal groups to city states to empires. There are over a thousand known languages spoken amongst these peoples, and their cultures had developed varied, and often profound, expertise in such fields as literature, agriculture, large scale architecture, metallurgy, astronomy, medicine, engineering, and mathematics. It is important that we recognize their important contribution to humanity. <\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Circle for Original Thinking&#8221; podcast is America\u2019s electronic talking circle for visionary thinkers and an open forum for fresh ideas and timeless wisdom applied to today\u2019s political and ecological challenges. It is available for subscription wherever podcast are distributed, including Apple and Spotify.
