Confident that he has the secret sauce to recharge any stagnant brand, he\u2019s got a slick pitch deck (with a snapshot from his own childhood), and he\u2019s engaged to Keiko (Ayako Fujitani), the corporate vice-president he reports to. His company is about to liquidate a money-hemorrhaging cattle ranch in Montana co-owned by Peg (Robin Weigert), when he parachutes in for a quick fix. His Japanese beef consultant Wada (Jun Kunimura) goes hilariously native, and Hideki, a smart guy, immediately sees that his idea for a quick fix was mistaken. Now unsettled and off the grid in an alien culture, Hideki recalibrates his values and his life goals. Mexican ranch hand Javier (Goya Robles) helps Hideki see that there is more to live for than just the bottom line and rising sales figures. When Hideki fails to come home on time, Keiko is sent to bring him back.<\/p>\n<p>Directed by filmmaker Marc Marriott making his feature directorial debut, and beautifully shot by cinematographer Oscar Ignacio Jimenez, this stunning film was produced by Brigham Taylor, Marc Marriot and Jeri Rafter. This premiered last year at the 2023 Tallgrass Film Festival, where it won Best Narrative Feature, and it also played at the Boston, San Luis Obispo, Sedona, St Louis International, Newport Beach, Zions Indie and Heartland Film Festivals, winning additional awards at all of them. The screenplay was written by Dave Boyle and Ayako Fujitani.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe story of Tokyo Cowboy was born out of my own experience living as a foreigner in a foreign land.  Years ago, I had a profoundly impactful experience living in Japan.\u201dSaid Director Marc Marriott. \u201cI went as one person and I came home changed.  My time in Japan caused me to become quieter- to listen more.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Thirty-six years ago, Marriott lived in Japan as a missionary and worked as a filmmaking apprentice to Yoji Yamada, the legendary director of the \u201cTora-san\u201d film series. When Marriott returned to the U.S. He came across an article in an American magazine that stirred his imagination. \u201cThe idea of this clash of cultures, Japanese cowboys on an American ranch,\u201d Marc Marriott says. \u201cI just thought: There\u2019s a movie in there, a great story.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201c\u2026thus was born Hideki Sakai and his journey in Tokyo Cowboy. Displaced and disconnected in Japan, Hideki Sakai spends his time acquiring other people\u2019s dreams. Like the characters in my favorite films such as Local Hero, I was charmed by Hideki\u2019s journey and his growing attraction to a place he has come intending to change, even destroy.  Hideki\u2019s bottom-line numbers-focused approach to life has left him empty- searching for more.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a story about finding untapped reservoirs of courage and empathy from your own culture, while also reaching out and connecting with others. Highlighting this character journey is the natural beauty of the Montana landscape: the stunning contrast to the rich neon beauty of Tokyo produces a unique visual palette.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe greatest dramatic stakes are when we risk something personal, and humor is most indelible when it\u2019s derived from a shared human experience. This is what I wanted to feel in Tokyo Cowboy.  I hope audiences are surprisingly charmed by this gentle narrative about Hideki\u2019s journey.  I hope that they can see some of themselves in Hideki\u2019s desire to listen, slow down, and connect with the land and with the people around him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tokyo Cowboy is produced through Salaryman Film.
