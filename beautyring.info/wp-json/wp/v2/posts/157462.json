In some cases, consumers were religiously growing the sourdough starter at their end, the practice passed on as legacy recipes made from scratch. This further builds a strong sense of community and accomplishment. They are also more engaged, as it increases their involvement in the process. Social media also was a major player. Instagram and Twitter are home to online trends such as perfectly scored sourdough loaves with an open, airy crumb. Online trends such as these can inspire home bakers and drive demand for artisan sourdough from professionals. This is exactly the strategic action about which the market players take the moves.<\/p>\n<p>When the local bakers diversify their sourdough line, they experiment with not only different flour types but also with flavors and means of fermentation, so it fits best with the tastes of customers that change periodically. Supermarkets, in the meantime, are stocking premade sourdough starters and high-quality loaves.

Because of this, consumer demand for low glycemic index desserts in Western Europe tends to be greater, and manufacturers are developing and launching low glycemic index sour dough desserts to cater to this demand.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The increasing popularity of traditional European bakery items that do not include gluten has created a thriving market for gluten-free bread products in Western Europe. Gluten intolerance is a condition that provokes an allergic reaction to gluten, a substance that occurs in various bowls of cereal, such as wheat and barley. Celiac disease is an extreme form of gluten intolerance that afflicts a small number of people. However, the number of people affected by this growing dramatically, which will drive its impact on the population to increase.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Sourdough is a great alternative utilized in bakery management in Western Europe due to its tactility and capacity to improve the flavor and texture of dishes in addition to lengthening their lives.
