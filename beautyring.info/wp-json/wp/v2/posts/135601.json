This validation confirms that Sanoma\u2019s climate strategy and business model are compatible with transition to a sustainable economy and limiting of global warming to 1.5\u00b0C in line with the Paris Agreement.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSanoma\u2019s K12 learning services and independent media have a highly positive net impact on \u00a0society. As producing reliable and fact-based content is the core of our business, ensuring that our climate action and transition plans are science-based and ambitious is key to us. This is why were are especially happy with the validation of our climate targets by SBTi,\u201d says <b>Alex Green, <\/b>CFO of Sanoma.<\/p>\n<p>Sanoma\u2019s carbon footprint in 2022 was about 157,000 tonne of CO<sub>2<\/sub> equivalents, which for comparison corresponds to about 0.3% of the national annual carbon footprint of Finland. Sanoma\u2019s validated SBTi target for own operations is to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 42% by 2030 from a 2021 base year. In practice, Sanoma focuses especially on reducing emissions caused by district heating and cooling of its premises and by company cars. Own operations\u2019 emissions generate about 5% of Sanoma\u2019s total annual carbon footprint. During 2020\u22122021 Sanoma halved these emissions, and they declined by further 7% in 2022. The reductions were mainly a result of investments in energy efficiency and use of renewable electricity as well as moving to renewable heating. In the coming years, own operations\u2019 emissions are expected to continue to decline remarkably due to further investments in use of renewable energy.<\/p>\n<p>Sanoma\u2019s most significant climate impacts derive from the indirect supply chain emissions. Sanoma\u2019s validated SBTi target is to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, fuel and energy related activities, and upstream transportation and distribution by 38% by 2030 from a 2021 base year. Sanoma\u2019s climate transition plan for value chain emissions is already in line with this target. During 2022, Sanoma\u2019s relevant Scope 3 value chain emissions declined by 8.2% as a result of several initiatives related to the use of materials, logistics and services. <\/p>\n<p>The climate targets are well-integrated into Sanoma\u2019s strategy and way of working. Together with development of inclusive learning solutions, Sanoma\u2019s s science-based targets are linked as sustainability KPIs to its EUR 300 million Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility signed in November 2022 and maturing in November 2026. In 2022, Sanoma was awarded with the leadership level score of A- in the global CDP Climate Change rating, considered the gold standard of corporate environmental transparency. Annually, Sanoma reports on the progress of its climate strategy according to the GHG protocol and Task Force on Climate Related Disclosure in its Annual Report. The reported environmental, social and economic sustainability indicators are assured by an independent third party on a limited assurance level.<\/p>\n<p><b>Additional information<\/b><br \/>Kaisa Uurasmaa, Head of Investor Relations and Sustainability, tel. +358 40 560 5601<\/p>\n<p><b>Sanoma <\/b><\/p>\n<p>Sanoma is an innovative and agile learning and media company impacting the lives of millions every day.
