The first was held in October at Wekiwa Springs State Park in Altamonte Springs. Both parks are included among the 75 Florida state parks located within the Florida Wildlife Corridor. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn addition to being a lot of fun, these screenings have provided a great opportunity for people to gather in some of Florida\u2019s most beautiful natural spaces and learn about the crucial conservation efforts in motion to protect wildlife and their habitats,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cWekiwa Springs and Camp Helen are unique and excellent hosts, and we are looking forward to holding similar events in 2024.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The evening also included a Q&amp;A session with the audience, with topics primarily focused on individual advocacy and public outreach for environmental and wildlife-related issues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLive Wildly was created to engage the public and expand awareness about wildlife corridors and the immeasurable benefits that they provide,\u201d Shipley said. \u201c\u2018Path of the Panther\u2019 has been an incredible tool in support of this mission, and being able to bring passionate supporters together with one of the film\u2019s driving creative forces at a beautiful state park is very special.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Florida State Parks Foundation, founded in 1993 as Friends of Florida State Parks and renamed in 2018, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation whose mission is to support and help sustain the Florida Park Service, its 175 award-winning parks and trails, local Friends groups and more than 20,000 park volunteers.<\/p>\n<p>It does this through programs that preserve and protect state parks, educate visitors about the value of state parks, encourage community engagement and active use of state parks, and advocacy. The volunteer Board of Directors represents private and public sectors as well as local and statewide interests. This event was completed through the Florida State Parks Foundation Services LLC, which is a limited liability company affiliate of the Foundation.<\/p>\n<p>Live Wildly is a public visibility campaign to raise awareness of the Florida Wildlife Corridor; educate citizens on its value and importance to the state\u2019s economy, ecology and overall way of life; and, to help jump-start a movement for its long-term protection. <\/p>\n<p>Live Wildly and the Florida State Parks Foundation invite individuals, artists, corporations, and organizations who share their vision to join this transformative partnership and support the critical work being done to safeguard and protect wild Florida.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Tim Linafelt<br \/>Florida State Parks Foundation<br \/>+1 850-559-8914<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/672268810\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=5-b8mhPL9B2RYKVZ&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      December 01, 2023, 16:37 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/672268810\/florida-state-parks-foundation-and-live-wildly-host-second-path-of-the-panther-screening-at-camp-helen-state-park\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
