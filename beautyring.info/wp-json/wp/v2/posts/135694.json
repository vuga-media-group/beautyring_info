Dishes like fresh crudos, house-made pastas, wood-grilled steaks and seafood are prepared simply and inspired by <span class=\"xn-location\">Italy<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">France<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Spain<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Greece<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Morocco<\/span>, and imagined here by way of local, <span class=\"xn-location\">Texas<\/span> ranchers and purveyors.

This space, with its open kitchen, seasonal patio and windows onto <span class=\"xn-location\">Fort Worth&#8217;s<\/span> Cultural District, is an effortless choice for breakfast, lunch, dinner and brunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are fortunate to have attracted world-class talent at Emilia&#8217;s and look forward to sharing their expertise and the Crescent&#8217;s beautiful dining room with our guests and the <span class=\"xn-location\">Fort Worth<\/span> community,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">John Goff<\/span>, Chairman of Crescent.<\/p>\n<p>Hand-crafted items on Emilia&#8217;s curated menu are simply prepared and influenced by Chef Paine&#8217;s international culinary experience along the Adriatic Sea and his time as a finalist on Food Network&#8217;s &#8220;<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4013238-1&amp;h=4086089355&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foodnetwork.com%2Fshows%2Fciao-house&amp;a=Ciao+House\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Ciao House<\/a>.&#8221; Mediterranean meets <span class=\"xn-location\">Texas<\/span> with menus featuring fresh pasta made with <span class=\"xn-location\">Texas<\/span> grains, fresh fish on <span class=\"xn-location\">Texas<\/span> white oak and local wood-grilled steaks dry-aged in house. Guests will find large and decadent dishes have a refined sensibility \u2013 fresh, ingredient-focused and with low intervention.<\/p>\n<p>Nestled just inside the main dining room and opening late <span class=\"xn-chron\">November 2023<\/span>, The Blue Room at Emilia&#8217;s provides an elevated, sought-after dinner destination, primed for longer, more indulgent meals. A custom Brindisi Trolley invites guests to begin their experience in a special way with creative cocktails and paired tastes. Guests can enjoy traditional caviar service and shellfish towers, and items like Wagyu Beef Tartar, Creste de Gallo with blistered tomato and rock shrimp fra diavolo, and Whole Grilled Fish served tableside.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I look forward to bringing the bright and sunny flavors of the Mediterranean to <span class=\"xn-location\">Fort Worth<\/span>,&#8221; said Chef Paine. &#8220;At\u00a0Emilia&#8217;s, I&#8217;m incorporating the techniques I learned from multi-generational chefs throughout my time competing on Ciao House to create a wide selection of authentic Coastal Mediterranean cuisine that will satisfy well-traveled visitors and culinary enthusiasts alike. The foresight, direction and passion Crescent and the Goff family has for the concept is truly inspiring, and I&#8217;m confident our guests and locals will feel that as soon as they enter the restaurant.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Taking cues from the statement wine wall, Emilia&#8217;s wine collection is robust yet approachable to satisfy connoisseurs and the curious alike. In addition to the selection of world-renowned wines, patrons will delight in a variety of creative and classic cocktails with a Mediterranean twist like the Camp Boulevardier, Olive &amp; <span class=\"xn-person\">Herb Martini<\/span>, Raspberry Limoncello, and Thyme Gin and Tonic. Cocktails were created by <span class=\"xn-person\">Jamel Taggart<\/span>, Director of Food &amp; Beverage, who has over 15 years of luxury industry experience including working at Aria <span>Casino<\/span> and Resort in <span class=\"xn-location\">Las Vegas<\/span>, Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, and Omni Dallas Downtown.<\/p>\n<p>Located just off the hotel lobby, locals and guests can gather at The Circle Bar, paying homage to the Fort Worth Circle, a progressive art colony that started in the 1940s. A famous work \u00ad\u2013 called &#8220;Three Virgins, 3 Giraffes and a Turtle&#8221; \u2013 which was etched by a Circle artist serves as inspiration for restaurant logos. The Circle Bar champions the Mediterranean mood and mindset by seamlessly transitioning from morning espressos to afternoon aperitivos with a rich variety of cocktails, wines and more into the evening. Here guests will enjoy Seasonal Crudit\u00e9s, an Emilia&#8217;s Burger and Dry-Aged Beef Tartar. In addition, Emilia&#8217;s offers two private dining rooms, both featuring thoughtfully curated menus from Chef Paine.<\/p>\n<p><b>Reservations for The Crescent Hotel, operated by HEI Hotels &amp; Resorts, are now open for stays starting <span class=\"xn-chron\">November 2023<\/span>, with reservations for Emilia&#8217;s Restaurant available on <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4013238-1&amp;h=4238022207&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fresy.com%2Fcities%2Fdfw%2Femilias%3Fdate%3D2023-10-27%26seats%3D2&amp;a=Resy\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Resy<\/a>.
