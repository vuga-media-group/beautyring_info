Hence, currently the total industries are more then 76,095, which are small and medium enterprises. Furthermore, the government is focusing on this industry as evidenced in the President Direction (Indonesian: Perpres) No. 14 Year 2015 about National Development Core Planning Year 2015-2035 in which cosmetic and traditional medicine industries are becoming diversified national economic backbones. Despite various promotional and marketing efforts by domestic brands in years, global brands, be it locally manufactured or imported, still dominate skin care products sales in Indonesia. The superiority of such brands is difficult to break as skin care products have specific target customers and they tend to be loyal to a particular brand.  <\/p>\n<p>They cannot easily switch to other products even if the competitors provide equal or better quality. The nation has 12\u201315% out of the entire population in the middle-to-high income range. These consumers, who predominantly reside in large cities, can afford to buy high-end imported products. For this specific group, quality, brand image, and being top-of-trends are among the major aspects considered while purchasing skin care products. Statistic wise, Indonesia has witnessed rapid growth of shopping malls over last 10 years. In the capital Jakarta alone, more than 100 shopping centers have been registered. More than 10% of them are intended for high-end or luxury imported products. This is anticipated to presents remunerative opportunities for European brands, which are regarded as expensive but come with top-notch quality, and are hence highly desirable. Rise in women population in the country coupled with higher inclination toward naturally derived skin care products are further anticipated to boost the Indonesia <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/skin-care-products-market\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">skin care products market<\/a> opportunity during Indonesia skin care products market forecast period. <\/p>\n<p>Market Segmentation  <\/p>\n<p>The Indonesia skin care products market is studied on the basis of product type, demographics, age group, and sales channel.
