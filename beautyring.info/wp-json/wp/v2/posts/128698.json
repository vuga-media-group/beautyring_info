The main parameters we set for ourselves were to maintain the attitude and grunginess of the original without any guitars. The riffs are extremely guitar-based and translating them to synthesizer was more challenging than we thought, but that was also the fun of it! The result is a reflection of the incredible songwriting of the original; the song is so good, it survives and shines even in a completely different genre.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Official Music Video Link:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nCover of \u201cThe Day I Tried to Live\u201d by Soundgarden<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nPerformed by Waking April<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y_sHrTUr8sg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y_sHrTUr8sg<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The original song, \u201cThe Day I Tried to Live,\u201d written and sung by the late Chris Cornell, was released by Soundgarden in April of 1994. It was the second single from the band&#8217;s fourth studio album, Superunknown, also released in 1994. The single landed at number 13 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart and number 25 on the Modern Rock Tracks Chart. \u2018The Day I Tried to Live\u2019 was also included on Soundgarden&#8217;s 1997 greatest hits album, A-Sides (Billboard 1994). <\/p>\n<p>Alex McKee of Waking April reveals, \u201cChris Cornell is the artist who made me want to write music. While the genre I write now isn&#8217;t near the grunge sound he perfected, this music spoke to me at the right time and is still something I reach for. For whatever reason, grunge bands like Soundgarden and Audioslave kicked me into loving music on a deeper level. I felt that music in my bones when I was growing up, and I&#8217;m so grateful for it. This is my favorite Soundgarden song and one of my favorite songs of all time. While Waking April fits more into an electro-pop mold, I\u2019ve never been able to shake the influence of grunge in our sound design. It especially shows up in our guitar-driven songs, but no matter the instrumentation, I\u2019m still a flannel-wearing head-banger in my heart. We joked for years about doing some grunge covers as a fun project. Then K.Flay released her EP of 90s covers, and we got inspired to actually do it. It had to be this song: it meant the most to me, we had the vision for the sound design, and Bethany has the vocal range for the impressive jumps in the song. Plus, we don\u2019t get many chances to play in such an odd time signature (we recorded it in 15\/4\u2026the engineer nearly killed me) so that sealed the deal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For their sound in the unique cover, Waking April used a blend of Arturia VSTs and analog synths but re-amped everything through analog gear while relying on a Neve preamp for the bass parts to balance out a mix of almost clipped clean tones and dirtied-up, distorted synth tones. Arturia\u2019s 808 colors can be found along with a Novation Bass Station 2 as the filter opens up into the choruses, which features Arturia\u2019s Arp 2600. Alex quips, \u201cI hope Kim Thayil approves!\u201d as he explains how he and Bethany used their Nord Stage 3 to sculpt the leads and translate the melodic riffs of the chorus into Waking April\u2019s distinctive synth-pop sound. Waking April\u2019s version of \u2018The Day I Tried to Live\u2019 was recorded by Holt William at Raleigh&#8217;s xOver Productions and produced by Alex McKee of Waking April. The official music video was also filmed and produced by Holt William.<\/p>\n<p>Waking April, just coming off a very exciting show with Raleigh electronic dream-pop artist <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/animalweapon.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Animalweapon<\/a> and Charleston\u2019s Olive Dares the Darkness on the final stop of their tour at the highly acclaimed Cat\u2019s Cradle Back Room in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, says they have big plans this fall. Bethany and Alex reveal, \u201cwe will be on tour this month and then be heading into the studio to work on our first full-length album in Nashville, Tennessee. We can\u2019t share too much yet, but we seem to have sparked some interest of a well-known producer and label, so we will update more as that progresses.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Waking April\u2019s cover of \u2018The Day I Tried to Live\u2019 by Soundgarden can be found on<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nApple Music at: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/music.apple.com\/us\/album\/the-day-i-tried-to-live-single\/1683457601\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/music.apple.com\/us\/album\/the-day-i-tried-to-live-single\/1683457601<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Bethany and Alex McKee from Waking April are available for interviews. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nOfficial Artist Contact: pr@agencychroma.com<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Chaunce Bellafleur<br \/>Agency Chroma<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/647681261\/mailto:pr@agencychroma\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">pr@agencychroma<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wakingaprilnc\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/waking_april\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@wakingapril9196\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@wakingapril\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">TikTok<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Waking April &#8211; Cover of The Day I Tried to Live by Soundgarden<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"y_sHrTUr8sg\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Day I tried to Live (Soundgarden cover)\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/y_sHrTUr8sg?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=4KZo5nopuAmLzd3K&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      August 02, 2023, 16:38 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/647681261\/electro-pop-duo-waking-april-release-official-music-video-for-their-cover-of-the-day-i-tried-to-live-by-soundgarden\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
