We have survived by anticipating market conditions and evolving to meet those needs.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Eric Parkinson, HHSE C.E.O.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>FAYETTEVILLE, AR, UNITED STATES, September 8, 2023\/<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/\" dir=\"auto\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">EINPresswire.com<\/a>\/ &#8212; Hannover House, Inc. (OTC: HHSE) has entered into a private investment venture to purchase movie specialty trailers, trucks and equipment to support the company\u2019s expanded activities as a feature production company. The equipment will be housed in a newly constructed facility consisting of 3,600 square feet of office and production space, along with a 4,200 square foot \u201cgrand room\u201d that will serve a dual purpose as a large storage garage for the vehicles as well as functioning as a production stage when needed. Pending finalization of the site and necessary permits, the company plans to commence construction in December with full operations ready by April, 2024.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs we have experienced with our current \u2018WILDFIRE\u2019 production, there is a significant world market for quality feature films,  and a predictable profit margin if they can be produced efficiently,\u201d said Eric Parkinson, C.E.O. of Hannover House. \u201cOne of the recurring problems we have encountered in the past few years is the near-absence of specialty movie trailers and professional production gear for rental in this part of the country. This new venture is a strategic move to help reduce costs of future Hannover House and MyFlix productions, while also creating a rental business opportunity to service other productions in the Arkansas, Oklahoma and Missouri markets.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The Hannover House movie equipment rental business will be branded as \u201cWHAM Rentals\u201d, an abbreviation of the phrase \u201cWe Have All Media.\u201d In addition to cameras, sound equipment and lighting gear, the biggest ticket items for the venture are the movie specialty trailers: an 8-unit \u201cSAG Honey Wagon\u201d for actors; a 3-unit \u201cLuxury Star Wagon\u201d and a 7-bay \u201cHair &amp; Make-Up\u201d trailer. The company is also looking at the possibility of purchasing a \u201cLunch-Box\u201d Production Trailer and a separate four-room restroom trailer. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cBased on our own, internal Hannover House facilitated productions for 2024, all of this equipment will be paid off within a year,\u201d said Parkinson.  \u201cAdditionally, as we anticipate nearly 24 weeks per year of down-time, the items can be rented to third party productions when we are not utilizing them, as an income source for HHSE and our private investors in the WHAM venture,\u201d he concluded.<\/p>\n<p>Full details of the financing structure and income forecasts for Hannover House will be included within the company\u2019s current S.E.C. registration filings.  <\/p>\n<p>Hannover House is producing or facilitating four features at this time, including  \u201cThe Last Days of Belle Starr,\u201d \u201cNative Fables\u201d, \u201cModern Antiquities\u201d and \u201cSenior Year.\u201d  Additionally, the company is working with overseas co-production partners on a high profile, three-picture slate valued at over $80-million, all of which will be shot in Europe. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHannover House has been operating continuously now for thirty years,\u201d said Parkinson. \u201cWe have survived by anticipating market conditions and evolving to meet those needs. There is a tremendous opportunity over the next few years to produce quality programming to service the worldwide explosion of streaming outlets. We are positioning Hannover House to fill that need, while also building a solid asset base in terms of company owned films and jointly-owned motion picture equipment.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>For More Information Contact:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nERIC PARKINSON, Eric@HannoverHouse.com \/ 818-481-5277<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Eric F Parkinson<br \/>EnterLink Media LLC<br \/>+1 818-481-5277<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/654479159\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=nQZgufqD4HvIMK58&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      September 08, 2023, 06:42 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/654479159\/hannover-house-announces-wham-studio-rentals-a-full-service-provider-to-the-motion-picture-industry\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
