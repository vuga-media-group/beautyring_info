Is it any wonder nurses are stricken with <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.atlanticspinecenter.com\/conditions\/lower-back-pain\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">lower back pain<\/a> more than any other profession, including heavy industrial jobs? But nurses can take proactive steps to avoid potentially disabling injuries affecting their backs, says <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.atlanticspinecenter.com\/about\/kaliq-chang\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Dr. Kaliq Chang<\/a>, of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.atlanticspinecenter.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Atlantic Spine Center<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While low back pain affects 8 in 10 adults in the United States at some point, the condition is even more common among nurses, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). As an occupation, nursing is most at risk from lower back pain, with as many as 90% of nurses reporting the problem, the NIH says. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cResearch has indicated that nursing is the job that requires the most heavy lifting, and this single activity is the most significant risk factor for developing musculoskeletal injuries, especially in the lower back,\u201d explains Dr. Chang, an interventional pain management specialist. \u201cEven worse, lower back pain tends to return again and again among nurses, affecting their wellbeing and job satisfaction. It\u2019s a major problem that needs to be addressed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Causes of back pain in nurses <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBack pain in nurses doesn\u2019t tend to result from one hard day on the job, Dr. Chang notes. Instead, repetitive motions and strain conspire to create a cumulative \u201cinsult\u201d on the spine and surrounding muscles. What nursing duties are the culprits?<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tPushing and pulling patients onto stretchers and wheelchairs<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tDressing and bathing patients<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tTransferring patients in and out of bed<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tLifting heavy equipment and supplies<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tBending over constantly or working in awkward positions<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tUsing vibrating patient care tools<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tStanding for long periods without rest<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese motions and positions impact muscles, tendons, ligaments, and spinal discs in the back,\u201d Dr. Chang explains, \u201cand nurses\u2019 resulting back pain can gradually develop over weeks, months or years.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Prevention tips<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDespite the demands of their occupation, nurses can boost their ability to fight off back pain by taking proactive steps to strengthen their backs and reduce their job-related burdens. Dr. Chang offers these preventive tips:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tUse proper lifting techniques. \u201cAs when lifting any heavy object, lift your patients using your legs, not your back,\u201d he says.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tAvoid overuse injuries. You likely can\u2019t avoid repeatedly lifting patients out of bed, transferring them into wheelchairs, or helping them onto commodes. But when you do, use whatever equipment is at hand\u2014including hoists or mechanical slings\u2014to lessen your own physical strain.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tApply heat and cold. A long day at work can be followed by a warm bath or a well-placed ice pack to help stem any twinges or jabs of pain in your back.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tWear the right shoes. Supportive, slip-resistant shoes do more than keep your feet comfy while you work\u2014they offer stability for your back muscles and stop you from possibly taking a tumble that can hurt your back. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tStrengthen your core. When core muscles in your abdomen and back are toned, they\u2019re more likely to protect you from injuries that can lead to back pain. \u201cMuscle weakness can contribute to back pain regardless of your occupation,\u201d Dr. Chang says. \u201cPilates is a great way to target your core muscles in a fun and engaging way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kaliq Chang, MD, is an interventional pain management specialist who\u2019s board-certified in anesthesiology.
