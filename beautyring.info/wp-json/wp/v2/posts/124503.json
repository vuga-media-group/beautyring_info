For the first time, the event features guest programming from <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/viff.org\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Vancouver International Film Festival<\/a> (VIFF) and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mhfestival.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Scottish Mental Health Arts Festival<\/a> (SMHAF). This year\u2019s Voices With Impact raises the discussion on climate change\u2019s mental health repercussions and the issue and impacts of mental burnout.<\/p>\n<p>Ten newly commissioned short films produced by Voices With Impact and funded by California\u2019s Mental Health Commission will make their world debut on the festival\u2019s opening day. These groundbreaking works, created by an international cohort of grant-winning filmmakers from Canada, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and the U.S., shed light on the intimate relationship between our planet\u2019s health and mental well-being. The film festival will include VIFF\u2019s specially curated shorts program and SMHAF\u2019s short film package.<\/p>\n<p>The premiere lays the groundwork for a week-long immersive dialogue on the intersection of mental health, burnout, and climate change, facilitated by the filmmakers. This collaborative platform invites filmmakers, artists, students, climate justice advocates, mental health professionals, and the public to engage in a transformative exchange of ideas driven by the powerful narratives from the ten debuting films.<\/p>\n<p>With a mission of building the next generation of filmmakers, the festival will host masterclasses curated by Voices With Impact filmmakers and industry mentors. The masterclasses exemplify Voices With Impact\u2019s commitment to empowering emerging artists to continue unfolding critical narratives around mental health and environmental concerns.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a filmmaker, finding the space to share your authentic stories can be difficult\u2014Voices With Impact champions impactful fresh narratives. We understand there is power in community; we connect our filmmakers with a network of creatives using art to improve the world.\u201d &#8211; Chris Hyde, Festival Director.<\/p>\n<p>Burnout, a pervasive concern, will take center stage during the Voices With Impact festival. The program will feature five captivating short films that offer unique perspectives on burnout, exploring the relentless pursuit of success and the need for balance and self-care.<\/p>\n<p>The five burnout-focused films, \u201cAre You Hungry?\u201d by Rachel Rose and Belen Garcia, \u201cFortune Cookie\u201d by Fu Yang, \u201cThe Otter\u201d by Randy Kelly, \u201cOut Beyond\u201d by Salman Alam Khan, and \u201cBurnt Horizons\u201d by Hao Zhou will captivate audiences and stimulate conversations around the complexities of burnout and its profound impact on mental health.<\/p>\n<p>Voices With Impact will also tackle the pressing issue of climate change and its far-reaching effects on mental health.
