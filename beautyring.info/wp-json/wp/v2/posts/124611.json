during the first three months of the year, the carrier still has the most flights impacted by weather given the location of its major domestic hubs.<\/p>\n<p>According to the airline, nearly 50% of its customers already turn to the app or <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3899946-1&amp;h=2359872185&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.united.com%2F&amp;a=united.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">united.com<\/a> to self-serve during disruptions, so United began beta testing the new feature at the end of last year. United found that customers responded well to having alternate travel options automatically served to them in the app and that airport employees appreciated reducing the number of people physically waiting in line.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our goal is to get our customers to their destination on time, but we know things don&#8217;t always go as planned and that&#8217;s when a tool like this can make a real difference,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Linda Jojo<\/span>, Chief Customer Officer for United. &#8220;Our new mobile app feature offers more transparency, saves time and reduces stress for our customers, and it shortens lines at customer service desks so our employees can better assist passengers with complex issues or questions. Plus, it&#8217;s another example of United&#8217;s continued investment in new technology and tools.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><br class=\"dnr\">When a flight is delayed by more than 60 minutes or canceled, customers will automatically see options for delays and cancellations on the home screen of the United mobile app. Here&#8217;s how it works:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><b>Get notified:<\/b> Click the link in the automatic text notification or enter flight details in the mobile app or <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3899946-1&amp;h=2359872185&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.united.com%2F&amp;a=united.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">united.com<\/a> to open the tool. For customers who have their reservation already loaded in the app, they&#8217;ll see a prompt right on the home screen.<\/li>\n<li><b>Check flight and re-booking status: <\/b>Confirm the status of your flight and see if you&#8217;ve been re-booked. Customers also have the option to look at other flight options and book based on their preference.<\/li>\n<li><b>Track your bags:<\/b> Follow the status of your checked luggage to see when it is checked-in, loaded on your flight and received at your final destination.<\/li>\n<li><b>View eligible vouchers: <\/b>Receive hotel, meal and\/or rideshare vouchers if eligible.<\/li>\n<li><b>Connect to a United customer service agent virtually:<\/b> Call, text or video chat with one of hundreds of United agents who can offer the same assistance as the agents at the airport.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For those without the United mobile app, the self-service tool is accessible on a mobile device or computer at\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3899946-1&amp;h=2359872185&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.united.com%2F&amp;a=united.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">united.com<\/a>, and customers still have the option to connect in-person with a customer service agent.<\/p>\n<p>This new feature is the latest way United uses technology to give travelers more transparency and improve the customer experience.
