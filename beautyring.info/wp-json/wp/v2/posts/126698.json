Based on the book, &#8220;The End of the Rainbow,&#8221; by Dont\u00e1 Morrison, THIRTY confronts same-sex love and relationships through a lens often ignored. The intersection of sexuality and spirituality is highlighted throughout this dramatic tale that exposes what happens when good intentions lead to unforgiveable results. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;My primary focus is developing narratives from the point of view of ethnic LGBTQ diversity. There are not enough shows in mainstream media that showcase authentic queer people of color,\u201d said Bawn.<\/p>\n<p>Anthony Bawn will introduce the first episode of THIRTY from 8:15 pm to 8:45 pm. Following the screening will be a Q&amp;A segment moderated by Donnie Hue and feature Bawn, Morrison, and members of the lead cast. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to give the audience an opportunity to gain deeper insight into what led Morrison to tell his story, partner with me, and the themes explored throughout the series, and overall process of bringing THIRTY to life,&#8221; said Bawn. <\/p>\n<p>THIRTY will be available on VIM Media (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.watchvim.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.watchvim.com<\/a>), a streaming platform that features content such as Cheetah in August (2015), As I Am (2020), Trace (2021), Conframa (2019-2021), and the award-winning feature film, Velvet Jesus (2021). <\/p>\n<p>About THIRTY<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nTHIRTY is a seven-episode TV series that pushes boundaries and explores the intricate lives of Tyrin and Khalil, a Black same-gender-loving couple forced to navigate through newly identified situations that can unravel their perfect relationship.
