Uranium ore refers to the process of extraction of uranium ore from the ground. At the mine, uranium ore is extracted and treated to produce uranium oxide, which is then exported. The conversion of mined ore into uranium oxide (also known as yellowcake) often takes place on the mine site. The main types of uranium ore are granite-type uranium deposits, volcanic-type uranium deposits, sandstone-type uranium deposits, and carbonate-siliceous-pelitic rock-type uranium deposits. Carbonate-siliceous-pelitic rock-type uranium deposits are an important mineralization phenomenon outside the Red Bed. Both not only have the same source, same time, and same area but also have the relationships of cause and effect. The mining type includes underground mining and surface mining.

It will grow from $1.11 billion in 2023 to $1.21 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.5%. The growth in the historic period can be attributed to the nuclear power plant construction boom, the cold war and military demand, the Chernobyl and three-mile island incidents, global economic trends, and changes in the regulatory environment. The uranium ore market size is expected to see strong growth in the next few years. It will grow to $1.81 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.5%. The growth in the forecast period can be attributed to government policies and incentives, focus on carbon emission reduction, geopolitical stability, exploration and discovery of new uranium deposits, public perception and social acceptance. Major trends in the forecast period include advancements in nuclear technology, development of in-situ recovery (ISR) technology, focus on uranium enrichment technologies, increased scrutiny on environmental and social impact, and diversification of uranium end-use applications.\u201d Active mining companies in the markets this week include <strong>Stallion Uranium Corp.<\/strong> (TSX-V: STUD) (OTCQB: STLNF), <strong>Uranium Energy Corp <\/strong>(NYSE American: UEC), <strong>FISSION URANIUM CORP. <\/strong>(OTCQX: FCUUF), <strong>Denison Mines Corp <\/strong>(NYSE American: DNN) (TSX: DML), <strong>NexGen Energy Ltd. <\/strong>(NYSE: NXE).<\/p>\n<p>Business Research concluded: \u201cRising nuclear fuel consumption is expected to propel the growth of the uranium ore market going forward. Nuclear fuel refers to the material used in nuclear reactors to generate energy through nuclear fission. Uranium ore plays a crucial role in the production of nuclear fuel, which is used to generate electricity in nuclear power reactors. For instance, in September 2021, according to the Government Accountability Office, a US-based government agency, approximately 86,000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel from commercial reactors were being stored at 75 locations across the United States, with this quantity consistently increasing. Therefore, rising nuclear fuel consumption is driving the growth of the uranium ore market.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stallion Uranium Corp. (TSX-V: STUD) (OTCQB: STLNF) Engages Axiom Exploration for Aerial Gravity Survey over Gunter Lake Uranium Project &#8211; <\/strong>Stallion Uranium Corp. is pleased to announce that it has engaged Axiom Exploration Group to conduct an Aerial Gravity Survey over its Gunter Lake (&#8220;Gunter Lake\u201d or the &#8220;Project&#8221;) Uranium Project in the southwestern Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan.<\/p>\n<p>The aerial gravity survey commencing in February is a leading-edge technology that records the density changes in the underlying rocks. The data from the gravity survey, when paired with the existing data from the VTEM<sup>TM<\/sup> Plus survey completed last year, will identify potential uranium alteration zones. The gravity survey data is an important determinant in the discovery of uranium mineralization and was one of the key geophysical surveys used during the discovery of NexGen Energy\u2019s Arrow deposit.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cAs we are readying to mobilize for Stallion\u2019s maiden drill program on our Appaloosa target, the deployment of the gravity survey will continue to move other prospective target zones towards drill readiness. Stallion\u2019s strategy is to pragmatically advance the highest priority target zones over our large prospective land package in the prolific southwestern Athabasca Basin,\u201d stated Drew Zimmerman, CEO. \u201cWe are at an incredibly exciting time where each step we take on our roadmap continues to move Stallion closer to finding the next uranium discovery!\u201d <\/em><\/p>\n<p>XplorerNxT systems are mounted on dedicated AS350 B-series helicopters. The AS350 is ideal for the close terrain following required for geophysical surveys.

The Irigaray CPP is the hub central to four fully permitted ISR projects in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, including Christensen Ranch.<\/p>\n<p>The first production is expected during August of this year and will be funded with existing cash on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet. As UEC&#8217;s strategy has been to remain 100% unhedged, produced uranium will be sold at prevailing spot market prices which was $106 per pound U3O8 as of January 15, 2024 as reported by UxC. In the coming months, the Company will provide additional information on the expected volumes for the first year of production. The key focus in the final pre-production phase before the August restart is hiring and training of additional operations personnel to augment UEC&#8217;s experienced operations team to ensure a successful ramp-up of uranium production. New personnel are anticipated to be hired from local communities such as Buffalo, Gillette, Casper, Kaycee and Wright.<\/p>\n<p><strong>FISSION URANIUM CORP.
