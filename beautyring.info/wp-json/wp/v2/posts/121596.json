This may be the first time in U.S. airshow history that spectators will be able to hear the narration in Spanish.  The Spanish narration will be broadcast on Facebook Live on the Oregon International Airshow page. Graciela, the \u201cAvionarradora\u201d will team up with local Spanish-language radio station KZZR (94.3) personality, Martin Zotelo. KZZR will air several live spots from the airshow on Saturday for radio listeners.

I\u2019m so excited in fact that my team and I invented a whimsical new word to describe this new role at the airshow \u2013 la avionarradora! We will serve other airshow communities coast-to-coast, with bilingual school assemblies, Spanish-language pre-show promotion, announcer and family engagement services, before and during airshows. We&#8217;re actively booking our 2023 and 2024 airshow schedules now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ahead of the airshow, the author will perform inspirational, bilingual assemblies to serve students at three local elementary schools. Graciela selected schools with dual-language programs in the Beaverton and Hillsboro school districts to reward students pursuing bilingual education and the educators doing the extra hard work in two languages. <\/p>\n<p>Graciela and her team from educational publisher <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gracefullyglobal.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Gracefully Global Group<\/a> will also showcase her children\u2019s aviation book trilogy at the Captain Mama booth on the flightline at all three shows between May 19th and 21st. The booth will also be staffed by Air Force Junior ROTC students from Battleground High School and Prairie High Schools, a fundraiser for their youth leadership programs. Visitors will have a chance to meet the author, have books signed, and dress up in Graciela\u2019s flight suits to take home a very special airshow memory. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Good Night, Captain Mama \/ Buenas noches, Capit\u00e1n Mam\u00e1,&#8221; &#8220;Captain Mama\u2019s Surprise \/ La sorpresa de Capit\u00e1n Mam\u00e1,&#8221; and &#8220;Taking Flight with Captain Mama \/ Despegando con Capit\u00e1n Mam\u00e1&#8221; are the three titles in this six-time, award-winning children&#8217;s aviation book series.
