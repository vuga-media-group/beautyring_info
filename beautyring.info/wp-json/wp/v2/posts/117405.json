However his ability has a unique twist: whatever and whoever he touches is stylishly pimped up.<\/p><p>Shot in the uncharted streets of Mexico City, Mijo is a colourful and fun fashion film inspired by the pachucos fashion from the 40s. The film is a collaboration with independent local artists, showcasing traditional Mexican tailoring, fashion, music and illustrations all in one project. Channeling the city&#8217;s edgy and urban spirit, Mijo reinterprets the myth of King Midas through a modern Mexican lens.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Fun Fact:The word Mijo is a contraction of the Spanish words mi and hijo, meaning my son. This is a term of endearment which roughly translates as darling or dear used in Spanish-speaking countries to refer to someone younger.<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Credits<\/p><p>Director and Writer: Mazdey Snob ( @mazdeysnob )<\/p><p>Art Direction & Styling: Mazdey Snob<\/p><p>Editor: Snob Solutions ( @snobsolutions )<\/p><p>Production: Snob Solutions<\/p><p>Director of Photography: Alberto Casuso<\/p><p>Cast: Gerardo Rocha, Dolores Black (@doloresdebernardo), Alejandra Soto ( @abortadealien )<\/p><p>MUAH: Marielos Coronel ( @marieloscorop )<\/p><p>Associate Producer: La Tia En Llamas ( @latiaenllamas ) Viridiana Lpez (@vilobau) Cristina Prado ( @cristinprad )<\/p><p>Music: Jarana Beat ( @jaranabeat )<\/p><p>Designers: Manov ( @manovmanov ), Colectivo creativo ( @colectivocretivodemoda ), Julio Jordan Mexico (@julio.jordan), De Barrio, Paloma Lira (@palomalirastudio)<\/p><p>Color: Can Aviral ( @can.aviral_color )<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p><\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>About Mazdey Snob<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Born in Mexico, Mazdey currently lives in Spain.
