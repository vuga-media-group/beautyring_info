Submissions were accepted from October 15, 2023 to March 1, 2024.<\/p>\n<p>Cash prizes of $1,000, $500, and $250, respectively, will be awarded to A. A. Rubin of East Williston, New York (\u201cNoah\u2019s Great Rainbow,\u201d First Place); K. M. Watson of Sykesville, Maryland (\u201cDesert Fish,\u201d Second Place), and Olaf Lahayne of Vienna, Austria (\u201cBeyond the Timberline,\u201d Third Place). Prizes are sponsored by the Book Bin.<\/p>\n<p>All 34 stories, including the three prize winners, will be published in a book-length anthology to be released in September of this year.        <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was exceptionally difficult to pick just three stories for special recognition when we were presented with so many arresting takes on the climate crisis,\u201d said the judges, Philip Wilson of the Book Bin, Ron Sauder of Secant Publishing, and Karen Gravelle, a widely published Onancock, Virginia author. \u201cIn the end, the top three were chosen for their general excellence in storytelling, imaginative scenarios, and central focus on climate change and its many ramifications in the lives of individuals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Common themes in the collection include subtle changes in human psychology, with growing erosion of personal relationships and society at large; the increasing precariousness of childhood and parenthood; changing relations between humans and animals, especially pets; and the gradual erasure of history, whether in the form of low-lying coastal graves or the public architecture of coastal communities.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAlmost all of our stories portray human resilience and tenacity, including in the form of geoengineering,\u201d the judges said. \u201cBut all of that resourcefulness is balanced against the exceptional complexity of Planet Earth and our limited ability to anticipate and control the future. In the world of this anthology, humans win some battles, while incurring losses whose magnitude is still to be fully reckoned.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In announcing the contest, which was promoted nationally and internationally, the judges made it clear that a wide range of genres would be welcome. The resulting collection features themes from social realism to dystopia, social justice to post-apocalypticism, humor to horror.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the three stories listed above, the winning entries are:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c2100, Remnants of a Thriving World,\u201d B.
