The book is Wendy Cohan\u2019s second title in \u201cThe Inn at Verde Springs\u201d contemporary romantic fiction series. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cBased in part on the family stories that my own Aunt shared with me, \u2018The Inn at Verde Springs\u2019 series was the chance to achieve my lifelong dream of writing contemporary romantic fiction. I chose to focus on the relationship between Harper and Paige Crawley, six years apart in age, who come together to support each other as they build an exciting new life in a completely different environment,\u201d said author Wendy Cohan. <\/p>\n<p>Overview of \u201cLove Child\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A busy autumn wedding season moves the Inn at Verde Springs into the black. Next up? Planning her sister Harper\u2019s spring wedding. But overachiever Paige struggles with telling Mr. Renaissance Man that he\u2019s fathered a child\u2026until it\u2019s unavoidable. Even though Paige\u2019s lie-by-omission is unforgivable, Ed Barrett is excited to finally be a father. Then, when Paige\u2019s pregnancy turns high-risk, Ed sets his anger aside and follows his heart. As Paige and Ed navigate their precarious relationship, the imminent birth of their baby has the power to unite them or divide them. But for Paige, the future is clear: Ed is the man who makes everything work, not just for her, but for all of them. When a serious accident puts Ed\u2019s life at risk, Paige devotes herself to helping him through the crisis, and, finally, brings him home to the most healing place she knows: The Inn at Verde Springs.<\/p>\n<p>What Others Are Saying<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cThe first two installments of Wendy Cohan\u2019s \u2018The Inn at Verde Springs Trilogy\u2019 have me completely hooked. The series features the Crawley sisters, Paige and Harper, as they reinvent their lives both professionally and personally in the enchanting setting of rural northern New Mexico.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the first novel, \u2018The Renaissance Sisters,\u2019 Harper takes the leading role. In the follow-up novel, \u2018Love Child,\u2019 it\u2019s Paige\u2019s turn as she navigates an unplanned and complicated pregnancy with a biological father she barely knows, while planning her sister\u2019s wedding and continuing to expand their fledgling inn\u2019s business. With help from her sister and their colorful circle of friends, everything comes together in a literally earthshaking conclusion.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat I love most about this series is the author\u2019s magical ability to pull the reader into a vivid world filled with sumptuous food, natural splendor, and populated with people you actually want to spend time with. After finishing \u2018Love Child,\u2019 I was left with the highly sought after experience of \u201cbook hangover,\u201d i.e., still feeling immersed in the \u201creality\u201d Ms. Cohan created, missing and wondering about the characters, and longing for another opportunity to rejoin Harper and Paige at the Inn at Verde Springs.\u201d \u2014Sue Boggio, co-author (with Mare Pearl) of Hungry Shoes<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCohan charmed readers with her debut novel, \u2018The Renaissance Sisters,\u2019 and \u2018The Inn at Verde Springs\u2019 Trilogy\u2019s book #2, \u2018Love Child,\u2019 will do the same. Sister Paige finds herself pregnant from a one-night stand\u2014or was it the beginning of a forever love? Follow along as she struggles to come to terms with her unexpected baby, an earthquake that alters the ranch, and you will be eagerly awaiting book #3.\u201d \u2014Jo-Ann Mapson, author of Owen\u2019s Daughter, Hank &amp; Chloe, and other novels<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI gravitate toward books set in my amazing, culturally rich, and beautiful state of New Mexico, and in my wanderings found \u2018Love Child,\u2019 the second book in Wendy Cohan\u2019s \u2018The Inn at Verde Springs\u2019 Trilogy. The Crawley sisters, Paige and Harper, have inherited a farm and are turning it into a destination site for weddings and celebrations. But one thing on Paige\u2019s agenda was NOT having a baby with a hunky man she barely knows. Best laid plans&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe conflict between Paige and her baby-daddy kept me on the edge of my seat\u2014and then their world blew up. Literally! It\u2019s a great twist in an already twisty story about two people who are getting to know each other during \u201ctheir\u201d pregnancy. And then\u2014 Nope. No more spoilers. You\u2019ll just have to read it yourself!\u201d \u2014Carol Potenza, author of the Tony Hillerman prize-winning Hearts of the Missing and the Nicky Matthews Mystery series<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Inn at Verde Springs\u201d Book Series<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBook 1 \u2013 \u201cThe Renaissance Sisters;\u201d May 23, 2023<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBook 2 \u2013 \u201cLove Child;\u201d October 3, 2023<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBook 3 \u2013 \u201cGifts and Revelations;\u201d 2024<\/p>\n<p>Book Available<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAmazon<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBarnes &amp; Noble<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBookshop.org<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBooksellers worldwide<\/p>\n<p>Genre\/category: <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFeel Good Fiction, Contemporary Romance, Women\u2019s Fiction.<\/p>\n<p>Paperback ISBN: 9781950495436<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nPrice: $18.99<\/p>\n<p>About Wendy Cohan<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nWendy Cohan writes contemporary women\u2019s fiction from her home in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
