He finds a young woman on Tinder and films her from the first moment he picks her up and brings her to his studio in Taos, NM where he strips her naked, pours paint all over her body and rolls her on an 8\u2019 by 16\u2019 canvas\u2026 viola\u2019 THE PAINTING\u2026shot in a single day. It\u2019s not just a painting, it\u2019s an Artist meeting his Muse  and discovering the power of Magical Thinking transcending his death and preconceived notions of Art Love and Money. <\/p>\n<p>The Filmmaker\u2019s Statement &#8211; THE PAINTING<\/p>\n<p>One day in the life of an artist\/filmmaker who swore he was done making films. He was content with his life, his history. He hadn\u2019t become the next big thing in Hollywood as he had imagined in his youth. He had fled to Taos, NM many years earlier to hide from those unfulfilled dreams. He was \u2018out to pasture\u2019 waiting to die, but happy. He\u2019d tried his best and that had to do. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI just want to be laughing when I die,\u201d he\u2019d told his therapist who he met with every Friday. Yet, he couldn\u2019t help himself and he filmed all of his therapy sessions. He\u2019s up to 251 recorded sessions. And excerpts of those sessions became part of the narration of THE PAINTING.<\/p>\n<p>He realized he\u2019d been an artist his whole life and one of his mantra\u2019s was, \u201cthe measure of an artist is the willingness to be vulnerable in your work and with your audience.\u201d  Towards that end he thought he might upload all those therapy sessions to YouTube and make them available to the public as a sort of time capsule for the world to see what they had missed.  <\/p>\n<p>He had funded all of his films himself, knowingly breaking one of the cardinal rules of Hollywood, always use OPM (Other People\u2019s Money). As a result he was constantly bringing both himself and his family to the verge of bankruptcy. <\/p>\n<p>His story was not sad or depressing because he lived a magical life. The Taos Mountain had blessed him and literally funded his freedom as an artist. <\/p>\n<p>And, that is where THE PAINTING begins\u2026 He got it into his head he wanted to create a giant painting (8\u2019x15\u2019) and he wanted to use a model as a human paintbrush (his Magic Paintbrush). <\/p>\n<p>So, he stumbled around social media and found a young woman who seemed even more eccentric than himself. He drove to Santa Fe to pick her up and bring her back to his studio. But again, he couldn\u2019t help himself, he put his camera up on a dashboard mount and filmed themselves from that first moment and in one day they created an entire film. He\u2019d found his \u2018Muse\u2019&#8230; Viola\u2019 THE PAINTING\u2026<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/showcase\/10677199\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">THE PAINTING &#8211; Screener \/ Trailers \/ Teasers<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.taoslandandfilm.com\/film-directors\/Jeff-Jackson\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">FILMMAKER HISTORY &#8211; More than you might want to know\u2026<\/a><\/p>\n<p>END<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Jeffrey F Jackson<br \/>Taos Land &amp; Film<br \/>+1 575-770-2685<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/663876369\/mailto:jeff@taoslandandfilm.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">jeff@taoslandandfilm.com<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCmlAmvwxdORqtFKsx766upA\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=_9BxLvW7_CytYt0f&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      October 24, 2023, 20:49 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/663876369\/world-premiere-the-painting-feature-documentary-for-academy-award-consideration-5-acre-taos-land-give-away\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
