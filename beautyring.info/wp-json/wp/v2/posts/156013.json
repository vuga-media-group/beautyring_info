When a young boy named Casey arrives at Mrs. Franny\u2019s farm, he\u2019s excited to participate in that tradition and find his own pumpkin to carve. But as his family enjoy the farm\u2019s many activities\u2014from wagon rides to sitting on a truly enormous pumpkin\u2014they soon discover that a small furry friend might also be picking them! <\/p>\n<p>Resplendent with watercolor illustrations that celebrate the warm hues of the fall season and the family with whom we share it, &#8216;Picking Patch&#8217; is scheduled for release on July 23, 2024.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Casey is so excited to pick out a pumpkin at the pumpkin patch. There are so many kinds to look at\u2014from round and bumpy to skinny and smooth! As Casey makes his way through the patch, he spots a new friend hiding under a wagon, peeking out from behind gourds, and even sitting on top of the pumpkin he decides to choose. At the end of the day, a pumpkin isn\u2019t the only thing Casey picks at the patch. Based on a true story, &#8220;Picking Patch&#8221; is the perfect fall read for pumpkin and animal lovers alike.

She believes that you are never too old to try something new, like writing a book. <\/p>\n<p>Diane has always worked in jobs that allow her to help others.

They have raised two wonderful sons and treasure every moment with their grandson, Harper T.S. &#8216;Picking Patch&#8217; is based on the true story of how Diane and her husband met their cat.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;About the Illustrator&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Cheryl Grant was born and raised in the mountains of Virginia. Simple country living and love of family influence many of her illustrations. <\/p>\n<p>Cheryl attended Mary Baldwin University, graduating in 1990 with an art degree.

During this time, she continued to create treasured art for friends and family. <\/p>\n<p>Cheryl returned to work in the early 2000s, creating a popular website that made her art available for digital download. Some of her most popular illustrations feature her adorable puppy, her two cats, and their sassy adventures. <\/p>\n<p>Cheryl now enjoys spending time with her grandson and watching him grow. &#8216;Picking Patch&#8217; is her second illustrated book.<\/p>\n<p>Interviews available upon request.<\/p>\n<p>Belle Isle Books, an imprint of Brandylane Publishers, Inc., is an independent press located in Richmond, Virginia that has published books since 1985.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Picking Patch&#8217; (hardcover, 36 pages, $26.95 \/ paperback, 36 pages, $15.95) is available for pre-order from <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Picking-Patch-Diane-Twomley\/dp\/1962416224\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Amazon<\/a>, Barnes &amp; Noble, and other fine booksellers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">PR Team<br \/>Brandylane Publishers, Inc.<br \/>+1 804-644-3090<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/728465467\" data-src=\"ZK5qAQ9tNNrKUoEK\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BrandylanePublishers\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brandypublish\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">X<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/brandylane-publishers-inc.\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/brandylanepublishers\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=RVvAMh778y7YKcei&amp;i=ZK5qAQ9tNNrKUoEK\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      July 18, 2024, 18:55 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/728465467\/picking-patch-invites-young-readers-on-an-autumn-excursion-to-choose-a-pumpkin-with-unexpected-results\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
