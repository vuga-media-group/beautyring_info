All the other kids on the bus already have friends, leaving him to stare out the window during the ride to school each day. But one day, he sees an older woman waving to him from her own window\u2014and his excitement draws the other kids\u2019 attention, as the whole school bus bonds over the grandmother who takes time out of each day to say hello. Mateo isn\u2019t lonely anymore!<\/p>\n<p>One day, though, Grandma isn\u2019t at her window\u2014but that won\u2019t stop the students on Mateo\u2019s bus from reaching out to her! Determined to repay her kindness and lift her spirits as she did for them, all the kids on the bus set out to find Grandma and make sure she has plenty of friends in the nursing home where she lives now. It\u2019s a heartwarming intergenerational effort that shows readers of all ages that small, simple acts of compassion and connection can inspire others, change lives and perspectives, and build goodwill in communities of all kinds.<\/p>\n<p>Based on a true story, and accompanied by tender illustrations that capture the diverse humanity of their subjects, young and old, &#8216;Grandma\u2019s Window&#8217; is scheduled for release on August 4, 2023.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Every day on the bus to school, new student Mateo stares out the window, wishing he had a friend to talk to . . . until one morning, when he spots something surprising in an apartment window\u2014an older woman is smiling and waving to the bus!<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;For the next few weeks, Mateo and his classmates wave to the nice lady they lovingly nickname \u201cGrandma,\u201d and she always waves back. But one day, Grandma is missing from her window, and she\u2019s not there the next day, either. Mateo and his classmates must work together to find Grandma and make sure she\u2019s safe and happy.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;&#8221;Grandma\u2019s Window&#8221; is a story of friendship and kindness that shows us that, no matter how young or old you are, the best way to bring joy into your life is to give it to others.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<\/p>\n<p>Janet Halfmann is an award-winning children\u2019s author who strives to make her books come alive for young readers and listeners.
