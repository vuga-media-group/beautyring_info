The report said: \u201cAdditionally, the rising application of big data in healthcare, as well as strategies to bring the big data system into healthcare are expected to support market expansion\u2026 Furthermore, the introduction of an advanced technological products by the market players is expected to propel the growth of the market\u2026 Thus, all the above-mentioned factors, such as the growing need to reduce healthcare costs and product launches by the market players, are expected to boost the market over the forecast period. In diagnostics, AI enables healthcare providers to make the most appropriate treatment decisions for their patients. AI can be used to identify cancer, triage crucial discoveries in medical imaging, flag acute abnormalities, assist radiologists in prioritizing life-threatening patients, diagnose cardiac arrhythmias, forecast stroke outcomes, and assist with chronic disease management\u2026 The rise in the prevalence of chronic diseases, along with product launches by market players, drives the segment.\u201d Active tech companies in the markets this week include <strong>Treatment AI, Inc. <\/strong>(OTCQB: TREIF) (CSE: TRUE), <strong>Palantir Technologies Inc. <\/strong>(NYSE: PLTR), <strong>Medtronic <\/strong>(NYSE:MDT), <strong>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. <\/strong>(NASDAQ: AMD), <strong>Butterfly Network, Inc. <\/strong>(NYSE: BFLY).<\/p>\n<p>Mordor Intelligence continued: \u201cThe increased prevalence of cancer and the high burden of other chronic diseases are, in turn, increasing the demand for accurate diagnosis and treatment. This is likely to increase the adoption of AI for early diagnosis purposes, ultimately boosting the market growth. North America is expected to hold a significant market share. The use of artificial intelligence in the North American healthcare market is being driven by the increasing use of advanced technology in healthcare systems, the growth in funding of AI-based startups, the rising burden of chronic diseases in the country, the growing need to reduce healthcare costs, and the implementation of big data in healthcare. The increased adoption of big data in healthcare in the region is expected to propel the market&#8217;s growth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Treatment AI (OTCQB: TREIF) (CSE: TRUE) Funded by the National Institute of Health to Develop a Culturally Sensitive AI Approach to Health Equity<\/strong> &#8211; Treatment.com AI Inc. (Frankfurt: 939) (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cTreatment\u201d) is pleased to announce that the Company has received funding from The National Institute of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d) to develop a culturally sensitive AI approach for collecting family medical history.<\/p>\n<p>Treatment AI has partnered with Rush River Research in Minneapolis to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach for collecting information about family medical history that is culturally sensitive and appropriate for African-American families. Current methods used by clinicians to collect family medical histories often do not satisfactorily capture important information from blended families or nontraditional relationships commonly found in racial or ethnic minority communities. The historical trauma and systemic bias common in African American communities can limit the amount of information known about the health of relatives. Without better methods for capturing information, existing health disparities addressing prevention and risk can persist. In collaboration with Rush River Research, Treatment AI is using its proprietary artificial intelligence capabilities to change how family health is collected and recorded to address existing disparities. The Company held multiple focus groups with African American doctors and community members to help develop and prototype culturally sensitive approaches to collecting information about family health.<\/p>\n<p>As part of their work building the world\u2019s most comprehensive and integrated online medical library powered by AI (the Global Library of Medicine), Treatment is aggressively acting to ensure that diagnostic and treatment information in the future will be provided by platforms that are free of the inequity commonly reflected in medical AI programs today. By convening focus groups of African Americans to evaluate Treatment\u2019s platform and provide insights and suggestions, the company ensures a rich and diverse perspective will inform the platform\u2019s continuous improvement.<\/p>\n<p>The family history solution has been initially developed through a prototype that integrates into the Treatment AI platform. As continued improvements in the solution are made, they will be provided to Treatment for testing and implementation into future generations of the Global Library of Medicine platform.<\/p>\n<p>Treatment and Rush River Research have recently submitted an expanded Phase 2 grant proposal to the NIH to extend the work. The goal of the proposal is to move the prototype into a commercial solution which will promote adoption and integration into electronic\u00a0health records and online apps.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Kevin Peterson MD, MPH, FRCS(Ed), FAAFP Chief Medical Officer stated \u201cOld data approaches inevitably reflect old biases. Treatment AI confronts issues of historical bias by reinventing how data about families is collected and stored to reflect the realities of modern life.\u201d\u00a0<strong><em>CONTINUED<\/em><\/strong><strong>\u2026 Read this full press release and more news for <\/strong><strong>Treatment.com AI <\/strong><strong>at:<\/strong>\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=MdWQXV0WycuQN1Lw8ptH392lQapmrhaYL1Mvfma6F7rFhnUo6GgZfHIlwvV0n2NRkJ8_Fh7VsUdnL6SJ4B7aUO82GbqjoU8tBXZprgd6R4k=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/treatment.com\/press\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>Other recent developments in the tech industry of note include:<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Palantir Technologies Inc.
