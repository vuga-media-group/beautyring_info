Seamlessly blending the excitement of the city with the carefree feeling of the islands, Margaritaville Hotel San Diego delivers fun and escapism to the heart of downtown, just steps from some of city&#8217;s top attractions including Petco Park, the <span class=\"xn-location\">San Diego<\/span> Convention Center, and the USS Midway Museum.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;After much dreaming and planning, we are delighted to formally open our doors and introduce Margaritaville Hotel San Diego to the Gaslamp Quarter,&#8221; says <span class=\"xn-person\">Jim Hollister<\/span>, General Manager of Margaritaville Hotel San Diego Gaslamp Quarter. &#8220;With our signature &#8216;no worries,&#8217; easy-going vibes and welcoming service, we look forward to bringing this unique style of hospitality to our beloved city of <span class=\"xn-location\">San Diego<\/span>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>From the creative minds behind award-winning firm <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3951455-1&amp;h=3143580431&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dawsondesignassociates.com%2F&amp;a=Dawson+Design+Associates\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Dawson Design Associates<\/a> in partnership with <span class=\"xn-location\">San Diego<\/span>-based <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3951455-1&amp;h=3017153744&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frossiarchitecture.com%2F&amp;a=Rossi+Architecture\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Rossi Architecture<\/a>, Margaritaville Hotel San Diego&#8217;s design infuses the brand&#8217;s signature island visuals with a Californian sensibility. Taking a local spin on the Margaritaville look, the lobby is reminiscent of <span class=\"xn-location\">Baja California<\/span> with a Mission style that is true to the spirit of the city, utilizing raw materials like stucco and concrete, custom hand-made furnishings from reclaimed wood, and creative works from Mexican artists. Even the brand&#8217;s signature margarita glass chandelier is unique to the region, comprised of colorful, eye-catching pieces that were hand-blown in <span class=\"xn-location\">Mexico<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Extending from the lobby into the halls and common spaces, the design was also influenced by <span class=\"xn-person\">Jimmy Buffett&#8217;s<\/span> Laurel Canyon days, evoking a new &#8220;Summer of Love&#8221; with art and d\u00e9cor that echoes the Golden State in the 1960s. The entrance boasts whimsical portraits in the vein of <span class=\"xn-person\">Andy Warhol<\/span>, while murals of Volkswagen buses stacked with colorful surfboards adorn the elevator lobbies.
