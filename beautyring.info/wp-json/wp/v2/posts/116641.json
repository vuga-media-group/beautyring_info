The Ministry of Commerce has declared 2023 as the &#8220;Year of Consumption Boost,&#8221; proposing ways to improve consumption conditions, create innovative consumption scenarios, cultivate a consumption atmosphere, and boost consumer confidence. With tourism being a critical aspect of post-pandemic consumption, the hotel industry will play a significant role in restoring and expanding consumption.<\/p>\n<p>After the lifting of pandemic lockdowns, the market rebounded exceptionally quickly. According to Horwath HTL&#8217;s &#8220;China Hotel Market Sentiment Survey Report for First Quarter of 2023,&#8221; released in February of the same year, the overall market sentiment index has returned to positive territory for the first time in three years. In addition, the domestic hotel market has demonstrated a clear trend toward recovery, with many operators maintaining optimistic attitudes about the market.<\/p>\n<p><b>Maintaining resilience in the face of pandemic challenges and achieving an 8.4% increase in 2022 revenue <\/b><\/p>\n<p>H World Group\u00a0Limited managed to overcome pandemic-related difficulties in 2022, maintaining its resilience and achieving excellent financial results. H World Group\u00a0Limited (NASDAQ: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ticket-symbol\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#financial-modal\">HTHT<\/a>)(HKEX:1179) (&#8220;H World&#8221; or the &#8220;Group&#8221;) recently released its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022 (&#8220;Q4-22&#8221;) and the entire year of 2022 (&#8220;FY22&#8221;). Revenue increased by 10.7% year-over-year to <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB3.7 billion<\/span> in Q4-22, in line with the previously announced revenue guidance of a 7% to 11% increase compared to Q4-21 and increased 8.4% year-over-year to <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB13.9 billion<\/span> for FY22. Hotel turnover surged by 10.5% year-over-year to <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB13.1 billion<\/span> in Q4-22 and increased 9.3% year-over-year to <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB49.6 billion<\/span> for FY22.<\/p>\n<p>He Jihong, the Group&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer, stated, &#8220;Despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span>, the Group\u00a0was able to achieve Adjusted EBITDA of <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB 610 million<\/span>, Adjusted EBITDA before non-cash impairment and forex loss was <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB 1.74 billion<\/span>. This accomplishment can be attributed to the strong recovery of our international business, as well as rigorous cost reduction efforts across the Group\u00a0implemented both at the hotel level and within our headquarters.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>H World Group&#8217;s <span class=\"xn-location\">Europe<\/span>-based business experienced a great recovery since its reopening in <span class=\"xn-chron\">February 2022<\/span>. Deutsche Hospitality (DH) saw a 22.9% increase in Average Daily Rate (ADR) and a 96.2% increase in full-year blended revenue per available room (RevPAR) compared to 2021. In the fourth quarter, Steigenberger hotels located in <span class=\"xn-location\">Qatar<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Egypt<\/span> drove the rebound of the blended RevPAR to 110% of 2019&#8217;s performance. Additionally, the Legacy-DH segment&#8217;s revenue in 2022 reached <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB3.2 billion<\/span>, reporting a 108.5% year-over-year increase with an adjusted EBITDA of <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB134 million<\/span> before impairment and unrealized losses.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Jin Hui<\/span>, the CEO of H World, stated the Group\u00a0displayed resilience while expanding its portfolio of new hotels in the face of pandemic challenges.\u00a0The Group\u00a0remained committed to its &#8220;Sustainable Quality Growth&#8221; strategy, opening 1,244 new hotels in 2022 while continuing to upgrade its existing brands&#8217; facilities to enhance the user experience. Additionally,\u00a0Legacy-Huazhu established six regional branches as part of its organizational upgrade, strengthening its foundation for full market penetration and high-quality operations in the future. The Group\u00a0exercised reasonable cost control measures, achieving a rental reduction of about <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB300 million<\/span> in 2022. Even in the most challenging times in the industry, H World prioritized its franchisees as crucial partners of the Group&#8217;s business. As such, the Group\u00a0waived the franchise fee of around <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB 300 million<\/span> for its franchisees.<\/p>\n<p><b><span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> consumption and economic recovery are strong; H World is confident in the potential of the Chinese market <\/b><\/p>\n<p>The tourism and hotel industry in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> has experienced a remarkable rebound following the lifting of the pandemic lockdown, with popular tourist cities becoming crowded, hotel occupancy rates rising, market investment transactions becoming active, and brands actively upgrading and expanding.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Jin Hui<\/span> highlighted the hotel industry&#8217;s recovery following the easing of the pandemic lockdown. Especially during the Spring Festival, the recovery of <span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> entire consumer market, especially the travel and vacation market, was highly robust. Moreover, the recovery is noticeable in economy-class, upper-midscale, and resort markets.<\/p>\n<p>According to the Business Travel Outlook Survey for the first quarter of 2023 published by the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA), corporate travel spending is expected to increase in 2023, with many companies sending more employees on business trips. Additionally, sectors such as finance, insurance, professional services, and consulting are expected to experience robust growth in travel spending. A new GBTA survey of more than 600 travel buyers, travel suppliers, and industry professionals worldwide indicates that the business travel industry will continue to recover. Although business leaders have had to face a recessionary situation, three-quarters (78%) of respondents expect their companies to do very much (22%) or more (55%) business travel in 2023 compared to 2022. Only 15% anticipated the same level of business travel compared to the previous year, while 7% expected to travel less. Furthermore, 90% of respondents believed their employees were willing to travel for work, and 88% of respondents were more optimistic about the recovery of the business travel industry than the previous month.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the economic slowdown in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> in 2022 due to the pandemic and other factors, the international community generally believes that <span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> economic and social dynamics will be further released as the pandemic enters a new phase of prevention and control. As such, <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> is expected to continue being a &#8220;stabilizer&#8221; and &#8220;engine&#8221; of growth for the world&#8217;s economic recovery. The American Chamber of Commerce in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span>, the British Chamber of Commerce, the German Chamber of Commerce, and many other foreign chambers of commerce in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> said that <span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> adjustment of its pandemic prevention policy would help restore the flow of people and business travel between <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> and abroad and restore market optimism and that <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> would continue to be a priority investment destination for foreign investors. The World Bank&#8217;s latest China Economic Briefing concluded that with the deterioration of global demand growth, the aggregate demand structure of <span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> economy is expected to shift gradually towards domestic demand. As consumer confidence improves and suppressed consumer demand is released, consumption will gradually recover, while infrastructure investment spending and rebounding investor sentiment will drive investment growth to pick up.<\/p>\n<p>The World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (WTTC) predicts that <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> will have the world&#8217;s largest tourism market by 2032, and <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> was also one of the largest markets before the pandemic. The 14th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> clearly outlines the government&#8217;s efforts to improve the tourism product supply system, stimulate the vitality of the tourism market, and create a new situation of multi-industry integration and development. The Chinese government will also expand the public tourism consumption system, improve tourism consumption services, and better cater to the multi-level and diversified needs of the people.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> has long been a top destination for inbound tourism and a significant source of outbound tourism, generating substantial revenue for the international tourism industry. As per relevant platform data, the volume of air tickets for some popular overseas destinations has increased significantly, and the demand for inbound tourism, visiting relatives, and business is being released. The Ministry of Commerce of <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> aims to collaborate with all stakeholders to create better conditions for the safe, healthy, and orderly movement of Chinese and foreign personnel, making positive contributions to developing international tourism and the world economy&#8217;s recovery.<\/p>\n<p>Regarding the post-pandemic era&#8217;s prospects for <span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> hotel industry, <span class=\"xn-person\">Jin Hui<\/span> is confident in the Chinese market, given the overall supply&#8217;s rise due to <span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> long-term economic growth. The Group\u00a0still holds optimistic expectations for the market in 2023, especially after the pandemic, and investor confidence is rising in the industry&#8217;s overall recovery. In 2023, the Group\u00a0aims to strengthen its foothold in the Chinese market and strive to maintain a positive development trend. <span class=\"xn-person\">Jin Hui<\/span> acknowledges that hotel operations are in a long cycle, and companies need to maintain resilience during that period. He believes that on the one hand, the Group\u00a0must continue to enhance the core competitiveness of enterprises. On the other hand, companies should innovate and adapt to different times and changes, matching the environment and challenges, to constantly pursue innovation and breakthroughs around customer needs.<\/p>\n<p><b>Insisting on &#8220;Sustainable Quality Growth&#8221;, with a network of high-quality hotels,\u00a0upper-midscale\u00a0brands layout, and digital management\u00a0improvement progressing together.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In 2023, H World aims to strengthen its foothold in the Chinese market with a strategic focus on &#8220;Sustainable Quality Growth.&#8221; To achieve this, the Group\u00a0has identified three key areas: expanding its network of high-quality hotels, empowering upper-midscale\u00a0brands, and upgrading its platform organization and digital operating system.<\/p>\n<p>First, the Group\u00a0will continue to expand its network of high-quality hotels. As the development of lower tier cities lags behind that of first and second-tier cities in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span>, the regional distribution of the hotel industry is relatively uneven. However, with <span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> economic development, urbanization, infrastructure construction, and logistics systems improving along with the increase of disposable income of residents in lower-tier cities, the lower-tier cities are developing unprecedented consumption potential. Thus, the Group will focus on developing and penetrating the lower-tier cities in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>As of 2022, the number of Legacy-Huazhu hotels in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> was 8,411, which is a net increase of 705. The number of hotels operating in lower tier\u00a0cities increased to 38%, compared to 2021&#8217;s 37%. The number of hotels under development was 2,544, of which 57% were lower tier\u00a0cities\u00a0compared to 56% in 2021. The number of cities covered by hotels in operation and under development increased from 1,062 at the end of 2021 to 1,126 at the end of 2022.<\/p>\n<p>Second, the Group\u00a0plans to accelerate the deployment of upper-midscale\u00a0hotels as consumers increasingly demand more and better experiences and quality offerings. To meet these demands, the Group\u00a0aims to gradually form leading brands in the entire upper-midscale\u00a0market in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> by sorting and adjusting its current brands like Crystal Orange Hotel, IntercityHotel, MAXX, Manxin Hotel, Mercure, and Novotel. By the end of 2022, the Group\u00a0has 523 upper-midscale hotels in operation and 287 upper-midscale hotels under development. The resort market is also a great concern to the Group. The Group\u00a0has initiated comprehensive cooperation with many real estate enterprises and many government cultural tourism enterprises in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span>. The development of the resort market, its growth, and the establishment of the brand are all of great importance. Brands like <span class=\"xn-person\">Blossom House<\/span> will be given good market placement and development opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Third, the Group\u00a0recognizes that the digital economy represents the future direction of industrial development. In the highly competitive hotel industry, hotels can only maintain the leading position in the market by providing differentiated services. The application and popularization of digital technology in hotels can help the hotels build a younger, more convenient, and more fashionable image, with the hotels&#8217; service, marketing, and management mode more in line with the needs of mainstream customers.<\/p>\n<p>The H World Group\u00a0aims to build on the strong membership and traffic of H Rewards by exploring its potential and enhancing the benefits and services available to its members. As part of this plan, version 4.0 of the H Rewards program was launched\u00a0in 2022, providing customers with new features such as intelligent laundry services, remote reservation options, and real-time updates on laundry status. This digital system offers increased convenience and value to customers. The percentage of online services has increased from 21% in 2021 to 71% in 2022. Additionally, the Group\u00a0is utilizing digital and intelligent management tools to increase efficiency and reduce costs, including reducing the employee-to-guest ratio and streamlining operations.<\/p>\n<p><b>International business is enjoying a strong recovery while the Group\u00a0will continuously recruit top talent worldwide\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In February of 2022, the European pandemic policy was released, providing new possibilities for overseas business development. He Jihong mentioned that the progress of the Legacy-DH business has increased rapidly due to the gradual resurgence of the market, with a significant upturn in RevPAR and revenue. The profit margin of the Legacy-DH business has significantly improved owing to the cost management and efficiency enhancements, indicating a shift from a loss to profit from operations. In the future, the Group\u00a0will strive to enhance its member movement strategy, increase investment in the direct channel sales, and additionally better management efficiency while reducing operating costs via Group\u00a0Digitalization.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Jin Hui<\/span> highlighted that the Group\u00a0would seek to integrate the Deutsche Hotels business more effectively and establish this business as the core of its overseas operations. The Group\u00a0would also focus on creating a recognizable brand image for this business and maintaining its profitability in <span class=\"xn-location\">Germany<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Europe<\/span>, and the <span class=\"xn-location\">Middle East<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, attracting high-end talents can effectively enhance the competitiveness of enterprises. <span class=\"xn-person\">Jin Hui<\/span> noted that the Group\u00a0constantly emphasizes cultivating a team of exceptional talents. In the era of change, building an agile and efficient organization and talent reserves to ensure a high-quality customer experience is the most vital challenge. The hotel industry needs numerous outstanding managers to lead it. Therefore, the Group\u00a0recognizes the importance of recruiting talented individuals capable of providing first-rate service and adapting to the changing times.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, the Group\u00a0has emerged as the leading hotel chain in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span>. <span class=\"xn-person\">Jin Hui<\/span> stated that the next phase of the Group&#8217;s management goal would be to bring <span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> hotel industry to global standards and heights. To accomplish this, the Group\u00a0must keep up with world-class companies in terms of management philosophy, talent requirements, and organizational capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>The Group\u00a0has always accorded significant importance to the growth and training of front-line staff and actively participated in school-enterprise cooperation initiatives. In 2021, the Group\u00a0achieved the distinction of being one of the school-enterprise cooperative partners recognized by the Chinese Ministry of Education, with their cases featured in the syllabus of various universities. Furthermore, the Group\u00a0plans to scour <span class=\"xn-location\">Asia<\/span> and the world to find exceptionally talented professionals with diverse backgrounds and expertise. The Group is confident that continuous innovation in business models and products can help it\u00a0overcome any challenges and generate sustainable\u00a0and high-quality growth for investors and the ecosystem at large.\u00a0He Jihong also expressed her anticipation for the Group&#8217;s future development, estimating a 61-65% growth in net revenue for Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022, with the gross hotel opening target estimated at 1,400 hotels. Ji Qi, the Group&#8217;s Executive Chairman, affirmed that the Group\u00a0would further strengthen the Group&#8217;s core competencies in operations and various platforms to build overall resilience.<\/p>\n<p>SOURCE H World Group Limited<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/rt.prnewswire.com\/rt.gif?NewsItemId=HK66669&amp;Transmission_Id=202304111220PR_NEWS_USPR_____HK66669&amp;DateId=20230411\" style=\"display:none\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Originally published at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/the-hotel-industry-is-leading-the-recovery-and-the-leading-group-deserves-attention-301794668.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer sponsored\">https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/the-hotel-industry-is-leading-the-recovery-and-the-leading-group-deserves-attention-301794668.html<\/a><br \/>\n<font size=\"-1\"><em>Images courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/pixabay.com<\/a><\/em><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SHANGHAI, April 11, 2023 \/PRNewswire\/ &#8212; China&#8217;s 2023 government work report states that the country will focus on expanding domestic demand and prioritize restoring and expanding consumption.
