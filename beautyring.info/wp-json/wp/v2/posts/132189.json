The early reader children\u2019s book follows a young dragon named Ember, who has a hard time reading and writing. By embarking on a magical journey, Ember makes new friends and completes three challenges, each of which help empower her to achieve her goals and teach her valuable lessons about reading, resiliency and perseverance. <\/p>\n<p>The book is written for young readers ages 6 to 10 years old, which was how old Rory was when she and parents recognized her learning differences. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI earn mostly A grades, am bilingual in both English and Spanish, and have exciting plans for college, but elementary school wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Rory. \u201cI remember how embarrassing it was in second and third grade. I couldn\u2019t spell very well and would pretend to read books around my classmates. In fourth and fifth grades, my literacy tutor helped me to discover that I needed to learn how to spell and read in a different way, using multiple senses.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A common misconception about dyslexia is that literacy challenges are correlated to intelligence, but a multitude of interdisciplinary studies have proven that incorrect and instead highlight that <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.readingrockets.org\/topics\/dyslexia\/articles\/dyslexia-and-brain-what-does-current-research-tell-us#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20failure%20of,frontal%20areas%20of%20the%20brain.\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">dyslexia is a result of the neurodiversity<\/a> that exists within all humans. This diversity in the circuitry of the brain makes cracking the alphabetic code more difficult but allows for many dyslexics to have remarkable strengths in other areas. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI first started working with Rory in 2016, when she was just 9 years old,\u201d said Lori Jurjovec, Rory\u2019s former literacy tutor. \u201cI knew from that first session that this was a special kid! Over the four years that we worked together, Rory always came in with a smile, ready to work, and eager to learn. Having to put in extra hours after being in school all day is not easy, but Rory never once complained. She was determined to push past the roadblocks dyslexia presented.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The multisensory learning program that worked for Rory is called the Barton System, which uses a reader\u2019s auditory, visual and tactile senses to connect sounds with words. The program is influenced by the Orton-Gillingham Approach, which breaks reading and spelling down into smaller skills. Rory took care to weave these crucial learning styles into the plot of The Reading Roar.<\/p>\n<p>A participant in District 203\u2019s Dual Language program, Rory has been educated in both English and Spanish since Kindergarten and used her second-language skills to help translate her book into a Spanish edition, titled El Rugido De La Lectura.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI want young students to know they\u2019re not alone if they struggle with spelling and reading, and that there are different ways to learn and become a great reader and writer,\u201d said Rory.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to using the book to raise awareness about dyslexia, Rory recently spoke on a teen panel for Everyone Reading Illinois, one of the state\u2019s leading dyslexia organizations, and also recently shared her journey in front of 200 parents and teachers at an event hosted by the Dyslexia Action Group of Naperville.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRory is a determined high school student with dyslexia who took a courageous step to share her personal learning struggles,\u201d said Jenine Hanson, President of the Dyslexia Action Group of Naperville. \u201cIn a candid and heartfelt moment at one of our events, Rory recounted the challenges she faced throughout her educational journey, emphasizing how dyslexia had posed significant obstacles to her reading and writing skills. Rory recognized the power of her story as a source of hope and encouragement, particularly for younger children.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As many as 67 million Americans present symptoms of dyslexia and are likely to struggle with aspects of traditional learning, according to the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/dyslexiaida.org\/dyslexia-basics\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">International Dyslexia Association.<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>As Rory has proven, dyslexia may make learning some things more difficult, but it doesn\u2019t make them impossible.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Todd Andrlik <br \/>Andrlik Family <br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/656428367\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=McYbLdZp2zrJ6NGI&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      September 20, 2023, 19:20 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/656428367\/naperville-north-high-school-student-publishes-book-to-inspire-young-students-with-dyslexia\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
