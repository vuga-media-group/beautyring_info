HairPeople Salon Dublin, which is owned by Bernadette Byrnes, Ireland&#8217;s renowned hairdresser, and Jennifer Zamparelli, an internationally famous media and TV star, takes a bold step towards sustainability. HairPeople takes measurable action to reduce its carbon footprint and promote environmental responsibility in the hair industry by buying Hemp Carbon Credits, which are a new category of carbon offset product. The captured carbon is being used to build sustainable housing in Ukraine with hempcrete, a carbon positive construction material made from hemp hurds.<\/p>\n<p>How it works: Tao Climate conducted a thorough carbon emissions audit. Having recently switched to 100% renewable electricity, HairPeople purchased 4 tonnes of CO2e Hemp Carbon Credits from Tao Climate to offset the salon\u2019s legacy and upstream carbon footprints. HairPeople is now certified as carbon neutral by Tao Climate, according to Tao\u2019s comprehensive, science-based, data-driven methodology.<\/p>\n<p>Jennifer Zamparelli, co-founder of HairPeople, expresses her delight at the salon&#8217;s achievement: &#8220;We are proud to be a truly carbon neutral hair salon. As a business, we have a responsibility to reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability in the hair industry. By purchasing Hemp Carbon Credits from Tao Climate, we are not only offsetting our carbon emissions, but also supporting the development of sustainable housing communities in Ukraine, for people who desperately need somewhere to live. We\u2019re also showing the way for the hair industry to deliver amazing services, sustainably. So, it\u2019s a true win-win-win for us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bernadette Byrnes, founder of HairPeople and a widely-respected and highly-experienced hairdresser, comments: &#8220;As an industry, hairdressing can have a significant impact on the environment. In becoming carbon neutral, we demonstrate our commitment to embracing sustainable business practices. We hope our actions will inspire other businesses to join us. Helping to house people sustainably in Ukraine is a wonderful way to use the carbon that\u2019s been captured from the atmosphere. The entire HairPeople team is so proud of what we\u2019ve achieved in this, our first year of operation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Felix Roick, COO and co-founder of Tao Climate says: &#8220;At Tao Climate, we believe that every business, regardless of its size, has a responsibility to take action against climate change. Our vision is to empower businesses to achieve carbon neutrality through innovative, scalable, and affordable solutions. Together, we can create a sustainable future for generations to come.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Gary Byrnes, CEO and founder of Tao Climate, explains: &#8220;Hemp absorbs more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than any other crop on the planet, making it a highly effective tool for carbon removal and sequestration. We\u2019re proud to work with Google in delivering our innovative technology solution to businesses and consumers worldwide, so that we can measure meaningful impacts on climate at scale. Our aim is nothing less than to stop climate change and our partnership with HairPeople is a key milestone on this journey to a better, sustainable world.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>HairPeople&#8217;s achievement is a significant step towards a more sustainable hair industry, buying Hemp Carbon Credits that help to rehouse people in Ukraine with the captured carbon. HairPeople Salon Dublin is leading the way in promoting environmental responsibility, while supporting sustainable communities worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>ENDS<\/p>\n<p>Hemp Ukraine Recover is a non-profit fund, working to rebuild Ukraine using hempcrete. They\u2019re currently building a 30-unit apartment complex specifically to house internally-displaced people. This remarkable project deserves all our support.
