Authors and publishers from around the world submitted their work to the International Firebird Book Awards for consideration. A select panel of 25 judges independently scored and evaluated the quality of the writing and production. Only entries with the highest scores were awarded the coveted Firebird.<\/p>\n<p>In his explosive memoir, Patrick Byrne, former CEO of Overstock.com, presents a harrowing account of his involvement in a maze of corruption and deception at the top tiers of the U.S. government. Published by <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/defiancepress.com\/product\/danger-close\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Defiance Press<\/a>, \u201cDanger Close: Domestic Extremist Threat #1 Comes Clean\u201d offers readers an extraordinary glimpse behind the veil of power, laying bare startling truths poised to redefine public knowledge of governmental operations.<\/p>\n<p>The prologue, penned by the highly regarded retired military officer General Michael T. Flynn, paves the way for Byrne\u2019s jaw-dropping disclosures. General Flynn writes, \u201cThe unbelievable saga of bribery, blackmail, rape, and murder, more commonly the fabric of fictional narratives, is the reality of a man coerced into facilitating these deeds for our government. Patrick&#8217;s testimony is genuine, the corruption he has unveiled is authentic, and the narrative becomes increasingly alarming as it unfolds.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Adding to the narrative\u2019s credibility, the preface by Maria Butina, who finds herself at the heart of Byrne&#8217;s story, illuminates her wrongful persecution and her unexpected bond with Byrne. Butina reveals, \u201cI was framed and made a scapegoat for alleged \u2018Russian Collusion\u2019 with Trump&#8217;s presidential campaign\u2014a collusion that never existed, as confirmed by both the Durham and Mueller reports. My consequence was an 18-month U.S. prison sentence. Regrettably, Patrick\u2019s involvement as \u2018patient zero\u2019 in my case, working against me with the FBI, was significant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDanger Close\u201d puts us at the forefront of world events and offers an insider\u2019s view into the machinations of power, illuminating ideas that challenge the status quo and question the integrity of government agencies. It is a fascinating excursion into the darker side of politics and is one of the best and most exciting books of the year. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHighly recommended.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nJohn Kelly<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDetroit Free Press<\/p>\n<p>Dave Roberts, CEO of Defiance Press, emphasizes the critical timing of the book&#8217;s publication, stating, \u201cWith the approach of the 2024 election, it&#8217;s imperative that the public learns the full scope of the \u2018Russiagate\u2019 conspiracy. Patrick Byrne&#8217;s revelations provide a sobering reminder of the urgent need for transparency and truth in our political discourse.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Danger Close\u2019 offers an insider&#8217;s view into the machinations of power, unveiling shocking realities that challenge the status quo and pose serious questions about the integrity of government agencies.<\/p>\n<p>Byrne affirms, \u201cThis book is a candid narrative of my personal experiences and the disturbing realities I discovered. My aim in telling my story is to highlight the insidious elements at play and to spark a critical dialogue on the necessity of accountability and openness in our governance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About The Author<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nPatrick Byrne, an alumnus of Dartmouth College, Stanford University, and Cambridge University as a Marshall Scholar, is a seasoned entrepreneur and visionary. Mentored by Warren Buffett, Byrne&#8217;s diverse ventures span real estate to blockchain, and he boasts 20 years as an E-Commerce pioneer at Overstock.com. Recognized as the \u201cNational Entrepreneur of the Year\u201d (2011) and with his firm honored as &#8220;One of America&#8217;s Most Trusted Firms&#8221; by Forbes, Byrne&#8217;s journey also includes a legendary battle against Wall Street manipulators preceding the 2008 Financial Crisis. Beyond his business achievements, Byrne unveils a second life intertwined with the United States Government. From exposing a fake Russian scandal to facilitating a bribe for Hillary Clinton, his involvement in historical events becomes a compelling narrative. Byrne argues these were early elements in a Deep State soft-coup against America, with the pivotal moment being the rigging of Election 2020\u2014a stance he believes challenges the principles of just government derived from the consent of the governed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDanger Close: Domestic Extremist Threat #1 Comes Clean\u201d Published February 2024, ISBN: 196310210X, 188 pages, is available in paperback, kindle and hardcover on <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/196310210X?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_JF3RE7ZM5AD6AVGWB0AA_1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Amazon<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/w\/danger-close-patrick-byrne\/1145014315?ean=9781963102109\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Barnes and Noble<\/a>, major retailers and via the publisher, Defiance Press. <\/p>\n<p>(View the book trailer here: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/Trailer_Danger_Close\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/bit.ly\/Trailer_Danger_Close<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>Media Contact: For a review copy of Danger Close or to arrange an interview with Patrick Byrne, contact Scott Lorenz of Westwind Book Marketing (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/westwindbookmarketing.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/westwindbookmarketing.com\/<\/a>) at scottlorenz@westwindcos.com or at 734-667-2090.
