Out of state actions filed by producers were ignored and allowed to go to default under the belief that the contract requirement for disputes to be filed in Arkansas would negate the foreign state defaults. This strategy &#8211; devised by former HHSE President and attorney Fred Shefte &#8211; ultimately proved flawed, and resulted in the company being burdened with millions of dollars in out-of-state defaults, all from cases lacking the factual basis for such claims.  <\/p>\n<p>Shefte took a medical leave of absence from the company in the summer of 2018, and never fully recovered or returned to Hannover House until his formal resignation in 2021 and his unfortunate death in April of 2022.  The company has had no new lawsuits in over four years as the business model of handling theatrical and video release of third-party-owned productions was discontinued.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe rapid collapse of the DVD market caught many distributors by surprise,\u201d said Hannover CEO Eric Parkinson. \u201cAs Video-On-Demand options exploded in popularity, the consumer willingness to spend five or ten dollars to buy a DVD of an independent movie collapsed. DVD\u2019s were no longer a good entertainment option, when the same ten dollars could buy a whole month of access to various streaming sites. However, some of the program suppliers to Hannover House filed lawsuits seeking payment for DVD\u2019s that were shipped to retailers, but returned unsold for credit. The Hannover agreements were clear in that royalties only applied to net unit sales, not gross shipments. So, these various lawsuits were without contractual merit. Yet, failing to file a response for dismissal \u2013 even when the cases were filed in the wrong venue \u2013 created a painful debt burden for the company to carry default judgment balances which could have been avoided.  We are grateful for the support of the company creditors and judgment holders in structuring fair and reasonable resolutions to these matters, and enabling our balance sheet to be markedly improved,\u201d Parkinson concluded. <\/p>\n<p>During the past 44-months, the company secured $763,910 in new debt, of which approximately $261,937 was reinvested into film productions, including WILDFIRE and THE LAST DAYS OF BELLE STARR. These production investments are readily recoupable to Hannover House from contractual sales deliveries. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThrough the support of new lenders, the company has been able to make significant progress in the creation of valuable assets, the preparation of MyFlix service and the reduction of our debt burden,\u201d said Parkinson. \u201cTheir support and confidence will soon be rewarded.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hannover House was founded in 1993 and has survived through tumultuous market changes impacting the independent film industry, by controlling overhead, anticipating trends and evolving to address opportunities as they arise.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">ERIC PARKINSON<br \/>Hannover House \/ MyFlix<br \/>+ +1 818-481-5277<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/653314064\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EricHhse\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/indiefilmsusa\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=Trv1KpUd1SKaaKW2&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      September 01, 2023, 19:26 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/653314064\/hannover-house-reduces-debt-by-more-than-57-in-preparation-for-new-business-plan-activities\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
