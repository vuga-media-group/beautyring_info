For the ones who practice self-care consistently, it provides them with long-term benefits, including mental and emotional health.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Dr. Poorvanshi  Alag, TTUHSC Psychiatrist<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>LUBBOCK, TX, UNITED STATES, February 9, 2024 \/<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/\" dir=\"auto\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">EINPresswire.com<\/a>\/ &#8212; Prioritizing self-care might seem selfish, especially around Valentine\u2019s Day and Lent, the time of year we\u2019re reminded to think of others and practice self-sacrifice. But what if the ultimate act of love was to strive to achieve a truly joyful and fulfilling life? When people are at their best, they build healthier and more fulfilling connections with others.<\/p>\n<p>A psychiatrist in the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Medicine explained that by making self-care a priority and embracing self-love, one unlocks a deeper sense of purpose, greater reliance and the capacity to truly connect with others. It is the ultimate gift for oneself and those around.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are several kinds of self-care which are important to maintaining a healthy and fulfilling life,\u201d Poorvanshi Alag, M.D., assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry, said. \u201cThere is physical self-care, which includes nutrition, sleep and exercise, mental self-care, emotional or spiritual self-care and social self-care.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Self-care is a holistic concept. It is a conscious and deliberate effort to take care of one\u2019s own well- being. What might work for one person might not work for someone else. For example, some might practice meditation for mental self-care; others might go for a nature walk or do yoga.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSelf-care helps in mental clarity and focus and in the reduction of stress and anxiety,\u201d Alag said. \u201cFor the ones who practice self-care consistently, it provides them with long-term benefits, including mental and emotional health. One thing, which is really important, is that self-care helps strengthen self-esteem and helps build resilience. When people have setbacks or challenges in life, they\u2019re able to work on them effectively. So even though people might believe that practicing self-care is selfish, it is really important to prioritize self-care. It helps in maintaining a healthy and fulfilling life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Practicing self-care can take as little as 10 minutes and be beneficial. Taking a shower is an example of practicing self-care. To get started, Alag recommended identifying the physical, mental and emotional things which rejuvenate, relax and help reduce stress. The next steps are to create a plan and dedicate a specific time for self-care. That could include setting timers to stay on track.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou just can\u2019t do this randomly,\u201d Alag stressed. \u201cSet aside at minimum five to10 minutes for self-care every day. You need to make sure it\u2019s dedicated time. Be mindful because you can be doing it and not be present. Self-care means being self-aware, compassionate about it and being present 100% on what you\u2019re doing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To stay on track, be sure to note your self-care as you progress. Accountability partners and a positive support system of people who also practice self-care is helpful. Setting realistic goals helps as well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSetting unrealistic goals and expecting them to be fulfilled leads to failure which is going to be more stressful,\u201d Alag said. \u201cAlways remember to reflect on the benefits. If you talk about the positives and how it\u2019s helping you, you\u2019re more likely to stay on track.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Finally, make sure to celebrate those achievements, added Alag. \u201cEven if it\u2019s small, make sure you do because the more you celebrate those small achievements, the more you\u2019ll want to be a part of doing things which involve self-care.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Suzanna Cisneros<br \/>TTUHSC<br \/>+1 806-773-4242<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/687536376\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=sJaCNrz6L1OCouwu&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      February 09, 2024, 20:34 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/687536376\/how-to-practice-self-care-this-valentines-day\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
