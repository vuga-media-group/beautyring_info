It is the perfect canvas for a non-conformist approach to the luxury hospitality landscape with W&#8217;s bold and energetic &#8216;Whatever\/Whenever&#8217; service ethos, dynamic design, and immersive programming as we celebrate <span class=\"xn-location\">Sydney<\/span> through a new lens.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>A BEACON OF BOLD DESIGN<br class=\"dnr\"> <\/b>Located within The Ribbon and designed by acclaimed Australian architectural firm, Hassell, <span class=\"xn-location\">W Sydney<\/span> rises above the roadways to hug Darling Harbour.\u00a0Its exceptional interiors are designed by <span class=\"xn-location\">London<\/span>-based Bowler James Brindley, who conceived <span class=\"xn-location\">W Sydney<\/span> through the authenticity of the city&#8217;s history, spirit, and lore; from the marine-inspired rooms and suites to the distinctive restaurant and bars. At the heart of the hotel&#8217;s design story is &#8216;the larrikin,&#8217; a quintessentially Australian character whose strong spirit informs and inspires the hotel&#8217;s luxe yet unconventional interiors.<\/p>\n<p>From the moment guests step past the W sign, inspired by the Australian flower Waratah, they are on a design-led journey. The copper-clad entry pays homage to subterranean <span class=\"xn-location\">Sydney<\/span> and its disused railway tunnels, and an illuminated vertical promenade sweeps guests up into <b>Living Room<\/b>, a vivid blue space that reinvents the conventions of a traditional lobby by turning it into a social hub. Embracing a &#8216;Future Noir&#8217; theme, Living Room is punctuated by an electric blue circular bar and nest-like seating that reference the Australian Bowerbird, a larrikin of the bird world. <span class=\"xn-location\">W Sydney&#8217;s<\/span> 588 guestrooms, including 162 exceptional suites, draw inspiration from the hotel&#8217;s harbourside location and nearby beaches, exuding marine-chic in their nautical white and navy-blue palette and undulating walls that echo the sails of yachts in the marina below. Bathrooms are rendered in deep oceanic blue and walk-in wardrobes feature a burst of graphic, inflorescent red and pink Waratah flowers for a playful touch.<\/p>\n<p><b>CUISINE SCENE<br class=\"dnr\"> <\/b><span>Across all its spaces, <\/span>W<span> <span class=\"xn-location\">Sydney<\/span> channels the boundless energy of the Harbour City and its culture of <\/span>inclusivity<span> with a tuned-in, curious attitude, amplified through always-on programming. Electrifying the city&#8217;s culinary and nightlife scenes, <\/span>W<span> <span class=\"xn-location\">Sydney<\/span> brings four new dining and bar venues across three exciting levels. <\/span><b>BTWN<\/b><span> embraces its unique setting adjacent to the flyover, drawing on its urban surroundings and weaving the iconography of night food markets into its spaces. Leading the culinary adventures at <\/span>BTWN<span> is Head Chef Chris <\/span>Dodd<span>, an alumnus of Aria and Blue Door, whose menus hero the produce of <span class=\"xn-location\">New South Wales<\/span>. Just as other restaurants in town are winding down, <\/span>BTWN<span> comes alive with <\/span><b><span class=\"xn-chron\">2AM<\/span>: dessertbar<\/b><span>, a late-night hotspot created in collaboration with Singaporean dessert guru <span class=\"xn-person\">Janice Wong<\/span>. <\/span><b>Living Room<\/b><span>&#8216;s menus embrace the hotel&#8217;s location on the edge of <\/span>Asiatown<span> with a focus on Sake and <\/span>Soju<span>, as well as Asian small bites. <\/span><b>29\/30<\/b><span> is a two-level bar with uninterrupted harbour views, the perfect place to celebrate <span class=\"xn-location\">Sydney<\/span>. A beacon at the apex of Darling Harbour, the <\/span><b>WET Deck <\/b><span>(pool) level bar evokes an underwater world with coral-inspired lighting and is a great spot for casual <\/span>tapas<span> and cocktails. Meanwhile, Level 30 above takes things up a notch with elevated cocktails, a menu of vintage Champagnes by the glass, and the above-sea-level d\u00e9cor of a <\/span>superyacht<span>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>UP AND AWAY<br class=\"dnr\"> <\/b><span>Switching the mood, <\/span><b>AWAY<\/b> <b>Spa<\/b><span> is an oasis of concrete calm designed to leave guests feeling rested and recharged in an idiosyncratic but nevertheless deeply restorative space. The five treatment rooms and connecting spaces are gently enclosed by the meditative, geometric art of <span class=\"xn-person\">Bradley Eastman<\/span> (aka <\/span>Beastman<span>). In addition to unique circular pods for beauty treatments, the spa features a bar for those who like to socialize while they decompress. The hotel&#8217;s <\/span><b>FIT Gym<\/b><span> is complete with <\/span>Technogym<span> equipment, whereas <\/span><b>WET Deck<\/b><span> is a place to chill poolside with stellar views of Darling Harbour. The 30-metre open-air infinity pool showcases a giant jellyfish motif crafted from vivid glass mosaic tiles, a further nod to the hotel&#8217;s joyful eccentricity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>BUSINESS IS PLEASURE<br class=\"dnr\"> <\/b><span>Whilst <\/span>W<span> <span class=\"xn-location\">Sydney<\/span> is destined to be <span class=\"xn-location\">Sydney&#8217;s<\/span> newest playground, it also means business. Located just steps from <span class=\"xn-location\">Sydney&#8217;s<\/span> International Convention Centre, the hotel features 1300-square-meters of exceptional event space across eight versatile rooms. Set on level five, <\/span>W<span> <span class=\"xn-location\">Sydney&#8217;s<\/span> 592-square-meter <\/span>pillarless<span> Great Room features floor-to-ceiling windows that afford extraordinary views of the city. The design connects to the lively Darling Harbour setting, with light fittings and a graphic carpet that explode in a creative tribute to <span class=\"xn-location\">Sydney&#8217;s<\/span> famous fireworks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span class=\"xn-location\">W Sydney<\/span> reimagines luxury for a new era, creating a vibrant new scene for Sydneysiders and visitors to the city,&#8221; says <b><span class=\"xn-person\">Craig Seaward<\/span>, General Manager of <span class=\"xn-location\">W Sydney<\/span><\/b>. &#8220;It&#8217;s a complete departure from the city&#8217;s traditional hotels and this unique W spirit is something you feel at every touchpoint, from our eclectic venues to the cool blue rooms and high energy programming. I can&#8217;t think of a better location for our new W hotel than <span class=\"xn-location\">Sydney&#8217;s<\/span> amazing harbour.
