The report continued: \u201cU.S. holds major significance in battery production after China, which makes it one of the key lithium-consuming countries in the world. The country has huge reserves of this important metal. According to USGS, lithium resources from brines and minerals accounted for 7.9 million tons in U.S., in 2022. Market players in U.S. are focusing on getting a hold on the battery supply chain due to increasing production of EVs in the country and as transportation of batteries is dangerous. In 2018, Interior Department listed lithium as a critical mineral, which paced up the mine permitting process. In January 2021, the Bureau of Land Management approved Thacker Pass Mine proposed by Lithium Nevada Corporation. This mine is believed to serve as the largest source of commodity supply in U.S. and is expected to be able to produce about 60 kilotons of battery-grade carbonate by 2026.\u201d Active mining stocks in the markets this week include: <strong>Lithium South Development Corporation <\/strong>(OTCQB: LISMF) (TSX-V: LIS), <strong>Lithium Americas (Argentina) Corp. <\/strong>(NYSE: LAAC)\u00a0(TSX: LAAC), <strong>Standard Lithium Ltd.<\/strong> (NYSE American: SLI) (TSX-V: SLI), <strong>American Lithium Corp. <\/strong>(NASDAQ: AMLI), <strong>Arcadium Lithium\u00a0plc <\/strong>(NYSE: ALTM).<\/p>\n<p>Grand View Research continued: \u201cThe market is characterized by a high degree of innovation to optimize both the manufacturing process, and also obtain high purity lithium.

Manufacturers have been focusing on developing and innovating new products by improving their production process.

The Alba Sabrina claim is the largest of the five, salar located claim blocks which total 3,287-hectares of the 5,687-hectare Hombre Muerto North Lithium Project (\u201cHMN Lithium Project\u201d) package. Pumping well PW23-AS-02 has been completed to 400 meters of depth and is being prepared for a long-term pumping test.<\/p>\n<p>Initial assessments suggest the well could be highly productive. Emergence, which is brine surging out of the hole, has been observed. This early indication is a promising sign for brine production potential.<\/p>\n<p>The planned installation of a custom-made metal capsule, functioning as a valve to control upwelling, further underscores the anticipation of substantial brine production. Implementing this valve highlights our proactive approach to managing the well&#8217;s emergent behavior, indicative of its expected high yield. A 20 HP pump set is to be deployed to a depth of approximately 58 meters, which aligns with the presence of the first filter in order to optimize brine pumpability. As the pumping operation commences, adjustments to pump capacity or depth may be made to maximize brine extraction.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are very pleased with our results to date and await further information from this wells performance,\u201d stated Adrian F. C. Hobkirk, Founder, President &amp; CEO.<\/p>\n<p>Upon long-term pump test completion of well PW23-AS-02, a pumping well is planned to be drilled on either the Viamonte or Norma Edith claim blocks south of Alba Sabrina. Continued development success and our Preliminary Economic Assessment Financial Model, published on March 04, 2024, has brought attention to the Company. Management is reviewing potential industry alliances or other potential business transactions and will apprise the shareholders of any developments.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. William Feyerabend, CPG, a Consulting Geologist and Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101, participated in the production of this news release and approves the technical and scientific content contained herein.\u00a0<strong><em>CONTINUED\u2026.<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0<strong>Read this release for the Lithium South news at: <\/strong><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=Ewh_wTOHtrPR5S6tibr0dPiu9qOkzEh5-pBo6S71WUIA_Zl5ulLCmr4sYwUqxByRQ_CCw8YPZE8xRGKI6NLsFd9wl74mAdlWXkldKMClhf5A09Uhoy9ofUvxjbqOb28EHvzwh4CS53IO96-cr_7_NQ==\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.financialnewsmedia.com\/news-lis\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>Other recent mining developments in the markets include:<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Lithium Americas (Argentina) Corp.<\/strong> (<strong>NYSE: LAAC<\/strong>) (<strong>TSX: LAAC<\/strong>) recently <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=1SnUQMSdc_AHvTKFwgUCxMLzZbnHprjGfNSzsJqa_ELFREc28GqVmMZ_ACDiAHcqccrQwd0nGAGBZtEp5VzKMKfonPBM79mLiUy-utyPvAbOkhy6-Drl17Ody40yYchQK7m8xlf8D7WgqSJiin27y_g90G-4V05F6pOEXGOxGDU=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">announced<\/a> fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, as well as its 2024 outlook.
