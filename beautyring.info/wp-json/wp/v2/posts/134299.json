With the ability to repair stretched musculature and trim excess hanging skin, a tummy tuck can provide natural-looking results after pregnancy, massive weight loss, or simply because a patient desires a more defined abdominal contour. When researching a tummy tuck and the various options for <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.doctorgoldberg.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Westchester plastic surgery<\/a>, many individuals wonder about the difference between standard abdominoplasty and a \u201cmini tummy tuck,\u201d which refers to a more abbreviated version of the procedure. Dr. Neal Goldberg highlights distinctions between the two treatment options and how patients can identify the best technique for their unique needs. <\/p>\n<p>While the exact details of each tummy tuck vary due to the personalized nature of the procedure, a full abdominoplasty generally involves bringing together separated internal musculature, removing excess skin, and slimming fat buildup in the abdomen. The belly button may also be reconstructed depending on a patient\u2019s needs, providing extensive and comprehensive enhancement of the midsection and torso. As a result, recovery after a full tummy tuck may be relatively longer than the healing period required by a mini tummy tuck. <\/p>\n<p>In contrast, a mini tummy tuck is designed for individuals who are only bothered by mild to moderate aesthetic concerns (sagging skin, excess fat, etc.) in their abdomen. This procedure removes excess skin below the naval, but does not address the internal abdominal muscles. There\u2019s also usually no need for belly button reconstruction during a mini abdominoplasty. Since the musculature isn\u2019t treated, patients generally experience an accelerated recovery period when compared to a full abdominoplasty. The incision and resulting scar may also be relatively shorter. <\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, discovering the most optimal tummy tuck technique for you requires a consultation from a board-certified plastic surgeon with experience performing body contouring procedures. When patients are under the guidance of a qualified aesthetic plastic surgeon, the safety and effectiveness of their procedure can be maximized. <\/p>\n<p>About Neal Goldberg, MD, FACS<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDr. Neal Goldberg is a Westchester-based board-certified plastic surgeon who offers the latest treatment offerings in aesthetic and reconstructive surgery.
