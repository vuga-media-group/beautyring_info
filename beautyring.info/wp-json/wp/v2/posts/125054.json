Cohan disregarded the spirit of the Revolution, and denied any non-original music its rightful recognition.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 George May<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>NEWARK, DELAWARE, UNITED STATES, June 29, 2023\/<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/\" dir=\"auto\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">EINPresswire.com<\/a>\/ &#8212; Where do we learn about love? About hate? About selfishness? About generosity? We learn from our parents. We learn from our friends. From our Clergy. But for many people, we learn from the movies we watch. <\/p>\n<p>This July 4th, many Americans will learn about Independence Day and the life of George M. Cohan, a flamboyant Irishman, and the personification of American patriotism, from the 1942 film biography Yankee Doodle Dandy starring James Cagney. <\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0422031\/bio\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Warner Brothers songwriter M.K.(Moe) Jerome<\/a> played a significant role in the making of that film. He taught Cagney to dance in the stiff leg way that Cohan used as well as other members of the cast, which included Cagney\u2019s sister Jeanne (who played Cohan\u2019s sister in the film.) Moe was so active on the set, playing the piano, and coordinating the twelve major Cohan numbers the cast performed, that the film\u2019s producer William Cagney (Jimmy\u2019s brother) dubbed him the movie\u2019s \u2018\u2019choreographer.\u2019\u2019 <\/p>\n<p>\u202fMoe and his lyricist partner, Jack Scholl, also wrote two new songs for the film, \u2018\u2019All Aboard for Old New York,\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Good Luck Johnny.\u2019\u2019 People who watched had no idea that they weren\u2019t authentic Cohan numbers\u2014until James Cagney revealed the truth. <\/p>\n<p>Cagney was so upset that many who worked on the film did not receive the screen credit they deserved. Violating the spirit of the Revolution (\u201cno taxation without representation\u2019\u2019) Cohan would not allow any music which was not his from receiving credit. <\/p>\n<p>Not long after the 1943 Oscar ceremonies\u2014in which Cagney won as Best Actor\u2014the only Oscar he ever won in his career, Cagney took out a full-page ad in Variety thanking those he felt were ignored. At the top of the list of six men were M.K. Jerome and Jack Scholl who, Cagney wrote, \u2018\u2019did a masterful job of telling the entire story of \u2018little Johnny Jones\u2019 in about 12 minutes of verse.\u2019\u2019 Moe would never forget Cagney\u2019s kindness or Cohan selfishness. <\/p>\n<p>Yankee Doodle Dandy was Cagney\u2019s last film at Warner Brothers. He left the studio to form his own production company. Other great roles lay ahead, like White Heat (1949) and Mister Roberts (1955) but none required Moe\u2019s talents. He never worked with Cagney again. <\/p>\n<p>So, on this Independence Day, remember the film\u2019s forgotten men overlooked by Cohan, the American version of the British King. <\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p>\u202f\u202f\u202fGary May is a historian and grandson of J.K.
