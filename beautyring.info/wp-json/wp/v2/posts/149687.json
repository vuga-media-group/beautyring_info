Ron Hubbard created the Writers of the Future Contest (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.writersofthefuture.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.writersofthefuture.com<\/a>) in 1983 to provide a means for aspiring writers of speculative fiction to get that much-needed break.  Due to the success of the Writing Contest, the companion Illustrators of the Future Contest was created in 1988.<\/p>\n<p>The annual Contests draw entrants from around the globe and are free to enter.  Winners retain full rights to their work, and each is given cash awards.  Grand Prize Winners receive an additional $5,000. The Contest flies out all winners to Los Angeles for an expense-paid, weeklong workshop given by Contest judges, culminating in a Black Tie Gala Awards event.<\/p>\n<p>In the 40 years of the Writers of the Future Contest, there have been 559 winners and published finalists.  The past winners of the Writing Contest have published 2,000 novels and nearly 6,300 short stories.  In addition, 16 winners have a combined 41 New York Times bestselling books.<\/p>\n<p>In the 35 years of the Illustrators of the Future Contest, there have been 406 past winners who have produced over 6,800 illustrations and 390 comic books, graced 700 books and albums with their art, and visually contributed to 68 television shows and 40 major movies.<\/p>\n<p>The Writers of the Future Award is the genre\u2019s most prestigious award of its kind and has now become the largest, most successful and demonstrably most influential vehicle for budding creative talent in the world of speculative fiction.  Since its inception, the Writers and Illustrators of the Future contests have produced 40 anthology volumes (with this event) and awarded upwards of $1 million in cash prizes and royalties.  <\/p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.writersofthefuture.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.writersofthefuture.com<\/a> and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.galaxypress.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.galaxypress.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Emily Goodwin<br \/>Author Services, Inc.<br \/>+ +1 3234663310<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/707116699\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/WotFContest\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WotFContest\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/john-goodwin-8b2ab18\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/WOTFContest\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/WritersoftheFuture\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@wotfcontest\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">TikTok<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=zL12WNN6iQwCHgn6&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      April 28, 2024, 01:15 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/707116699\/winners-announced-for-the-40th-annual-l-ron-hubbard-writers-and-illustrators-of-the-future-achievement-awards\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"channels\" dir=\"auto\">\n        Distribution channels:<br \/>\n        <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/books\" title=\"Book Publishing Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Book Publishing Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/business-economy\" title=\"Business &amp;
