Our glasses are made for living. We do it; explore it, seek it, &amp; most importantly live it.&nbsp;<\/p><p>OUR PHILOSOPHY&nbsp;With a peculiar following of style-makers &amp; a core pillar of social responsibility, the 3rdEyeView philosophy stands on being a small accessory with a big impact.&nbsp; Our [ON SIGHT] program collaboration w\/ local non profits provides vision screenings, eye exams and new eyewear to the underprivileged.

My brand was created out of rebirth. The concept of unlimited transformation. Like the life cycle of a butterfly; who seeks solitude in its cocoon before emerging and spreading its wings to fly, I too had to gain my strength from within and now its time to soar. This past year created a lot of opportunities for self reflection and helped me gain the courage to create this brand. A realization of a life long dream unfolding and blossoming before my eyes.

I was born in Santa Marta, Colombia, grew up in Monteria, and currently live in Medellin. Im passionate about craftsmanship and hard work, so I hand-make all the designs in my brand along with some local artisans. Andra is all about providing people with a spiritual connection while being fashionable and in accordance with current trends. Andra was initially started as a business creation for a degree project. I was in Guadalajara, where I attended the largest jewelry fair in Latin America. I saw a large sign that said, jewel the business of your life, and decided to undertake this project. The name of my brand comes from the Andes Mountains, which is the longest continental mountain range on earth. The grandeur and majesty of the mountain range are some of our main sources of inspiration. I love fashion, jewelry, and design, and I also believe in spirituality and energies transmitted through stones. Each stone we sell at Andra is unique, colorful, and comes with a special meaning, just like each woman who wears it.<\/p><p>As a child, I used to take jewelry classes, which I loved! Thats where I learned how to make my first necklaces. Ive always been passionate about fashion but also knew how superficial it could be. With stones, I found the perfect balance between a fashion brand and something that allows individuals to connect with their essence. Our boho-chic styled accessories inspired by Colombia are made of gold-plated brass and 925 sterling silver for deluxe designs. The way the stones are used for each Andra design adds a bit more elegance to your look. Since theyre the trendiest this reason, our current collection includes chains and hoops. We are a brand that highlights and accompanies the beauty of the authentic, strong, and brave woman. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/andrajoyeria\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external sponsored\" style=\"color: rgb(140, 151, 154);\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">@andrajoyeria<\/a><\/p><p><strong>ASHTON JEWELRY<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625538258597-88ZIDR936L26M2546V6I\/193847371_1771541583049163_1843684965223018822_n.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"193847371_1771541583049163_1843684965223018822_n.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625538258605-SVFDZTGVJBKJH4K7IP7L\/197405589_1773524869517501_1612970404697927512_n.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"197405589_1773524869517501_1612970404697927512_n.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625538258154-U50HT7QGIYMMPXM0RT6H\/184420266_1756046227932032_5640365202346054702_n.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"184420266_1756046227932032_5640365202346054702_n.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p>[USA] Personal Design. Distinctive Jewelry. Made by Hand.&nbsp;The Lure of Handmade. There is inherent value in handmade jewelry. It takes an incredible amount of time to produce just&nbsp;one piece of jewelry, and each piece receives the utmost attention to detail. The Raw Materials - Bold and graceful, my jewelry is handcrafted and custom made from recycled fine silver (999), sterling silver (925), 18k and 24k gold. The diamonds, sapphires and other precious&nbsp;gemstones are ethically sourced. Leftover materials go into a scrap jar and are melted and reused to create other pieces of jewelry.&nbsp; The Etching Process<\/p><p>Etching is a process using a resist and acid to add textures and designs to metal. After melting, hammering, forming and cleaning the piece, I use a pancake griddle, computer circuit board paper or asphalt and an acid bath to etch and create distinct designs incised in the metal. The&nbsp;process takes several days to complete. About Me - I am a Colorado jeweler who fell in love with metalsmithing in high school, winning an award for one of my first pieces. An MBA, consulting career, and two children later; I returned to my artistic craft and focus upon making stylish &amp; elegant jewelry that I enjoy wearing.

Not only does it collaborate with the concept of snakeskin throughout my collection, but it is also the overall meaning &amp; message behind it. Historically, serpents represent fertility or creative life force. A symbol of rebirth, transformation, immortality &amp; healing. The inspiration quote I use for my line is The sky above, the sand below, peace within it corresponds with my meaning of Cottonmouth Swim.&nbsp; Unlike snakes we cannot shed our entire skin, but we do have the ability to go through rebirth, transformation &amp; heal ourselves, finding the peace within. I wanted to show off how snakeskin can be distinctive, just like us humans we come in various colors, shapes &amp; sizes. I believe snakeskin can be fierce, striking, sexy, edgy yet gentle, resembling some of my personalities along with the styles of bathing suits. Diving into Opulence. I added the matching couples set for the lovers out there. When both coordinated in their Cottonmouth Swim, they are not only telling everyone they're together but in terms of looking fashionable. Best part of my swim products is that they are made of American REPREVE &amp; eco-friendly ink.

She found herself searching for the perfect outfits for her trips and began to notice it was difficult for her to find exactly what she was looking for. She was always interested in fashion and knew how to work a sewing machine from watching her grandmother as she grew up. After searching for the perfect bikini and finding nothing, she decided it was time to make her own. She posted her first creation on Instagram and people began asking her where they could find her bikini. When she made them aware that she was the one who created it, they encouraged her to start her own swimwear line. Summer of 2019 she decided to do just that.&nbsp; Since the idea of the brand came from her wanting to design looks for herself to wear on vacation, she decided to name the brand DAV. It comes from removing the S in her last name Davis. She wants the collection to reflect her style and prides herself on the fact that she would wear any and all of her designs.&nbsp; So far DAV has two collections, with the 3rd debuting at 2021 Miami Swim Week. She believes this collection will be her best yet because she has put the most time and effort into it. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/davibystace\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external sponsored\" style=\"color: rgb(140, 151, 154);\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">@davibystace<\/a><\/p><p><strong>FEELYN SWIM<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625481231348-5EUGOU8JY2CDF222RHP4\/FEELYNV.jpeg?format=1000w\" alt=\"FEELYNV.jpeg\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625481231249-2GYKWJDYSGFYFAWK1UYO\/FEELYNVV.jpeg?format=1000w\" alt=\"FEELYNVV.jpeg\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625481230442-KPL1YNLDHQQAF3XU1100\/FEELYN.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"FEELYN.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p>[CANADA] Feelyn is a Canadian luxurious womens swimwear brand founded by lifelong best friends Gilda Lio and Dee Tassielli at the age of 23.

Hiromi creatively designs exclusive styles all made by Japanese high-end Kimono textiles. The Kimono was originally a Japanese garment with many unique features: form, motif, design, fabrics, and accessories. It has a long history  more than 1,000 years  in Japan, yet in its native country the art of kimono creation is on the verge of crisis. Reduction of the kimono market, aging of artisans, and lack of their successors are slowly fading the once vibrant art. Hiromi hopes to reverse the trend and bring her collection all made by Kimono textiles to its rightful forefront in fashion. Hiromi Asai first developed womens fashion made by Kimono textiles, presented Hiromi Asai &amp; Kimono Artisan Kyoto collection at 2016 F\/W New York Fashion Week, and distributed it to the world.

The idea of Illegal swimwear was created by Janelle Harmon in 2017. Janelle is a native of Philadelphia, Pa. who travels a lot for work and leisure. Swimwear is a stable item in my suitcase for all travel. I was constantly asked about the swimwear I would wear on various vacations and when giving out the information for the sites I procured my swimsuit collection, I noticed to get the style swimsuit I desired there was no one stop shop. When I would give out recommendations, many of my friends who wore sizes beyond Large were often in a space where cute trendy swimsuits were not available. The majority of suits available were designed with a more conservative consumer base in mind. I became inspired to create a brand of swimwear that was risky and trendy but all inclusive with options for women up to a 5x in size. Illegal Swimwear is a brand whose intention is to bring confidence and sexiness to the pool or beach. Women do not have to be subjected to modesty if their character screams risk taker. At the time I was not able to put Illegal swimwear into action so it was simply a folder of ideas and resources. In the beginning of 2020, Covid-19 hit my industry hard and I found myself not working and eventually furloughed. During my time off I decided now more than ever is the time to pour into my dream of creating a swimwear brand. The concept of the brand I was creating was there but it needed a name. The name Illegal swimwear came from the inspiration of my belated Aunt Berneice. Aunt Neicy as she was affectionately called, encouraged being different, expressing yourself and not submitting to what was defined as standard. Her inspiration is what led me to Illegal Swimwear. The name alone will peak your interest. The seductive styles will draw you in and the confidence you feel when wearing your suit is what keeps you here. At Illegal swimwear, our motto is Defy everything Appropriate, Be courageous, Be sexy, Be Illegal. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/illegalswimwear\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external sponsored\" style=\"color: rgb(140, 151, 154);\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">@illegalswimwear<\/a><\/p><p><strong>IWAWHY<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625478155141-UJODTTDZ00DZ6HRHZNCK\/IwaWhy+Pikake+Nouveau+Set.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"IwaWhy Pikake Nouveau Set.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625478151290-VW2JC6XMK9WOABP14JX9\/IwaWhy+Blush+Bombshell+Squad.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"IwaWhy Blush Bombshell Squad.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625478153271-7V8ZLA50XAFGT3CHY4RF\/IwaWhy+Chacha+Abalone+1.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"IwaWhy Chacha Abalone 1.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p>[USA] FROM HAWAII WITH ALOHA IwaWhy is a premier swimwear brand based in Kona, Hawaii, taking the industry by waves.

With a background in Arts, Silvia worked for almost 20 years in the corporate world before moving to New York when jewelry design became her art expression. Silvia developed IZA in 2011 with the intention of merging art with the intimacy of jewelry. IZA quickly evolved in its use of materials and has since developed into the full line of &nbsp;jewelry that it is today. The brand is ever-experimenting with the boundaries of traditional jewelry. Inspired by the tradition of art breaking with convention, IZA offers a new perspective on jewelry with a thoughtful balance of tension &amp; scale. IZA re-contextualizes jewelry into unexpected arrangements and modern silhouettes. The pieces deliver the experience of art through simple &amp; valuable objects. Our selection of jewelry is defined by signature contour shapes, unexpected material arrangements, and other worldly stones at a times. All IZA jewelry is crafted in New York with the best quality materials. IZAs pieces are organic, bold and kinetic. She goes for versatile and easy to wear and refers to her pieces as mini sculptures because each piece is unique. Her materials are mostly brass and copper with gemstone accents. She employs various techniques which give them a signature look, including unique cuts. The result is a look of elegance and modernity. Since its launch IZA has been recognized by Vogue, Paper Magazine, L'Officiel, and ELLE to name a few, and has been worn by Alicia Keys, Janelle Mone  Cardi B, and India Arie amongst others. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/izabysilviadavila\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external sponsored\" style=\"color: rgb(140, 151, 154);\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">@izabysilviadavila<\/a><\/p><p><strong>JAGGED HALO JEWELRY<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625477787478-LQ9KBMJKK1PHGPODIXCO\/JAGGED2.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"JAGGED2.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625477787688-8KE98TMRDC2992QW19MA\/JAGGED.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"JAGGED.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625477788150-M8K7HJPOGDKMV9Y0GVGP\/JAGGED3.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"JAGGED3.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p>[USA] Featured in Harpers Bazaar and Rebel Magazines, and worn by Latin Grammy Winner Chiquis Rivera and Pop Singer Alice, Jagged Halo Jewelry is the brainchild of its creator Haleh. With a passion that began in childhood, she now realizes her dream of designing her own line of bold, edgy, yet easy to wear jewelry.&nbsp; We pride ourselves on crafting quality pieces at affordable prices, utilizing materials as durable as they are alluring.&nbsp; The name of the brand captures its essence, symbolizing the duality that shapes both the designer and her creations. The fierce visuals of gunmetal gray and spikes speak to her darker side; the soft edges and delicate metals point to her sensitive nature. I began this line because I rarely came across quality jewelry that was also edgy, bold and most importantly a big bang for my buck. Most of my pieces are multifunctional. Necklaces can be wrapped as bracelets, and some are long enough to be worn as belts. All my designs are produced with bases of stainless steel or nickel &amp; lead free brass that are either gold filled or layered heavily in gold plating to ensure they are both visually striking and hypoallergenic. My brand embodies inclusivity, diversity and badass-ness. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jaggedhalojewelry\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external sponsored\" style=\"color: rgb(140, 151, 154);\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">@jaggedhalojewelry<\/a><\/p><p><strong>JAMEMME<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625465020760-KW32RYVPNBZODA9GRHWO\/jamemme_resort21--202111628.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"jamemme_resort21--202111628.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625465019974-VXMAJOPIHMIELFVQPTKN\/jamemme_resort21--202111231.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"jamemme_resort21--202111231.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625465019973-W8ZAK7T1TNLE1GMSXJ4M\/jamemme_resort21--202111011.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"jamemme_resort21--202111011.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p>[UKRAINE] JAmemme is a wearable couture brand based in Kyiv, Ukraine.

THE STORY - Christine Rochlitz, founder and head-designer of LUCKYNELLY  BERLIN, had always been very interested in fashion, design, interior, painting, colors, new trends and creating unique and exclusive things, so she studied fashion design at the University of applied science and arts in Bielefeld, Germany with successful graduating and established the brand in Berlin in 2012. The brand name was created by Christine's beloved Bearded Collie dog NELLY and her cute little rabbit \"LUCKY\" who were the muses for and for the decision to use only cruelty-free and vegan materials and to renounce of any animal skin, fur, silk and wool. She started using cork for the collections because it looks and feels like real leather and can be embossed to have the snake or crocodile print. But there are so many more innovative ecological vegan materials to find. As a real crazy material stalker she found the most innovative ecological vegan materials in the world as the sewable wood and slate stone, Piatex (made from Pineapple fibers), Muskin (made from mushrooms), Malai (made from Coconuts), Desserto (Cactus \"Leather\") silver colored washable paper, foldable ceramic that can be cut by scissor for making jewelry and Apple Skin (made from apples waste) to name a few that are used now for fashion, years ago. After two years of tough work, the British Vogue contacted her and wanted to present Christine and the brand LUCKYNELLY as one of the new talented designers in the world. The unique style also attracted attention and recognition at the British ELLE, Harper's Bazaar and Cosmopolitan, which published in printed issues. \"With my fashion accessories I want to show that vegan fashion is very luxurious, unique and the lasting trend for our future.\" \"My inspirations for new handbags and collections I get from nature, from animals, these beautiful creatures, with an iridescent look as the rose chafer and iridescent snakes. And there are so many more beautiful things you can find in nature  wood structures, fields, flowers, anywhere even in the city.\" \"For my designs I let inspire me by the beauty of nature, because it already carries all the perfect design in itself.

PRSVR, which represents the fundamentals of Passion Resilience Sacrifice Values Respect, has created a Heritage in dressing defining moments for unique people. Innate entrepreneurs, Brandon and Margaret Williamson sacrificed their 401k earnings (and wedding fund!) to launch what would become the starting grounds for so many creative stories today. The self proven Designer Brand manages to translate new shapes, colorways, and silhouettes into designs that are truly wearable. PRSVR also maintains the exclusivity of true designer brands by making every release Direct and Small Batch. By focusing on unique items, PRSVR has been the secret of many favorite fashion moments of the past 8 years. With brick and mortar experiences set in Chicago, Brooklyn, Washington D.C., Atlanta, Detroit, Miami, LA, and now Burbank, in person interaction has been a focus of the brand since day one. Family owned and operated since 2012, PRSVR has partnered with McDonalds, The Recording Academy, Upscale Hype, The Hollywood Reporter, and many more, which has allowed for the brand to continue to elevate the culture, and their views on Family, Fashion, and Philanthropy. Under the vision of Designer Brandon Williamson, PRSVR is \"designed 'for people with somewhere to be' he jokes as he ponders what he hopes his vision portrays.. \"Independent thought.. independent decisions. Our ability to tell what we think the future is, and to see others agree. We, as designers are helping tell stories that haven't been constructed yet at the time we design them, and for some people we really nail it. That is our 'Genius Thing' at work.\" PRSVR is a digitally native brand, but has always had a strong position within retail. \"We knew that in order for people to accept us as a Luxury House, we would need to create a culture that allowed you to feel safe at the price point. There were several layers to how we were able to present an elevated standard. The genius thing we did, was we persevered, hence the namesake.\" says Designer CEO Margaret Williamson. A former executive in Corporate America, Margaret has brought on new meaning to the term CEO, by properly positioning the brand to navigate the changing environment and trends. Margaret has created the vision and the plans that bring Brandon's designs forward. The result is a unique perspective on clothes that you actually want to wear. Before marrying and launching PRSVR, each owner individually trained with Fortune 50 companies. PRSVR translated that experience into a boutique brand that secretly services the Entertainment Elite while raising a family and a brand. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/prsvr\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external sponsored\" style=\"color: rgb(140, 151, 154);\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">@prsvr<\/a><\/p><p><strong>QUOIFISH SWIMWEAR<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625474207620-2MYN13S0T7Q3AJZLAWS0\/QUO1.jpeg?format=1000w\" alt=\"QUO1.jpeg\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625474208159-TASJT2PD104NTA8MGM43\/QUO3.jpeg?format=1000w\" alt=\"QUO3.jpeg\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625474207670-73YE5OI37Y2BKXC4WQFZ\/QUO2.jpeg?format=1000w\" alt=\"QUO2.jpeg\"><\/span><\/p><p>[USA] QuoiFish Swimwear was founded on July 16, 2018 on South Beach in Miami (USA).

We believed a bikini could be more than just a bikini - it could be an ode to the beautiful places it is worn and the oceans it swims through. In a constant state of salty hair and muddy feet we stay awestruck by each and every sunset, moved by how the colors of the ocean blend with the reef, drooling at acai bowls and consciously sharing our ocean playground with its inhabitants - and this is what we use as inspiration behind each and every design. Rhea was created for the stargazing, rain dancing, moonlight skinny dippin' babes. Those who celebrate the moment - a fleeting sunset, a crashing wave, the last few drops of a coconut. The women who need a bikini to keep up with their days of chasing waves, but also a brand that supports the preservation of their earth playground.

Our belief is that the form an artwork takes should be inspired by its materials; Not the other way around, as is the case in traditional art forms, in which the artist 'transforms' base materials into something very different. SOLOMEINA stands behind truth and quality to materials; We believe the nature of your materials and what you stand for should not be hidden, but celebrated. Every piece is original, handcrafted and personal to us. Our hope is to create works that are reflections of the world through our eyes. Pieces that carry a part of us and that reflect our constant excitement, the dynamism we see in the world and the free-flowing qualities of space that we're fascinated with.

We believe that clothing is genderless, and we cater in equal measure to men, women, and non-binary individuals. THE CONCEPT Providing personally designed, fitted, and curated collections for each individual client is the essence of who we are. At The Tailory New York, we believe that your wardrobe should not only fit perfectly but should be designed with only YOU in mind. The end result?clients get the best of both worlds: impeccable custom fit and custom-designed pieces that work seamlessly with their lifestyle. A NOTE FROM THE FOUNDER - The idea for The Tailory New York began when I decided to direct my years of fashion design and mens tailoring experience towards my own wardrobe. As a pantsuit aficionado and a lover of mens fashion and tailoring, I was always drawn to tailored clothing and strived to create fashion that conveyed the same message of confidence that a perfectly custom-tailored suit did for men. Style icons like Sean Connery and Cary Grant, as well as modern-day 007 Daniel Craig (shaken not stirred), were always my style inspirations. To me, they are the epitome of refinement and sophistication, true gentlemen in style. My passion for fashion and tailoring led me through the Fashion Design program at Parsons followed by stints in custom tailoring, fashion design, fashion styling, and brand development. But the more I integrated myself in the industry, the more I realized that an impeccable fit, for men and women, was almost impossible to find in ready to wear clothing. So in 2013, I launched The Tailory New York as a way for me to combine my two passions: Fashion Design and Custom Tailoring. Everyone wants to look their best and having a wardrobe curated to your body and lifestyle not only enables you to look your best but makes you feel your best. Let us curate and design the wardrobe fit for you! <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/thetailorynyc\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external sponsored\" style=\"color: rgb(140, 151, 154);\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">@thetailorynyc<\/a><\/p><p><strong>TRUFFLE BIKINIS<\/strong><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625471317323-IRV1NBXMXTHYKXAIQUXW\/3+%282%29.png?format=1000w\" alt=\"3 (2).png\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625471318040-9SCQP9YDGGZQ5M44S64E\/TRUFFLE.jpg?format=1000w\" alt=\"TRUFFLE.jpg\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"color: inherit;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/5d4db75bd36bb3000116f4c6\/1625471317296-QFDRIPEO10X3HA7I1DFU\/2+%282%29.png?format=1000w\" alt=\"2 (2).png\"><\/span><\/p><p>[UK] Truffle Bikinis  a luxury fashion swimwear brand.

The idea is, that a bag can be that little detail which will make you feel special and &nbsp;sweeten up your day, just like a candy! The Candy Store, where all&nbsp;Candies&nbsp;start as an idea, and are then being handcrafted - is a magical place, where imagination and fun and joy and the love for color are being materialized into bags. It is a place where personal enthusiasm on certain topics is being translated into small fashion visions - with the wish to spread the joy. In&nbsp;The Candy Store, the point of fashion is&nbsp;transcendence; the desire to sweeten up the everyday banality with color and a story, that each Candy and collection tells.&nbsp;VENA&nbsp;<em>candy<\/em>&nbsp;breathes color and celebrates the beauty of it, and all the joy its different shades bring. It is about finding beautiful, very often subtle, but also unpredictable color combinations. Let there be color! Playful and sometimes a bit crazy, but always feminine Be cheerful, be playful, love Candies! The Candy Store&nbsp;experiments with materials, including (but not limited to) eco leather, faux fur and special fabrics, from suppliers mostly from Italy and Germany. Each bag is handmade, with a lot of attention to detail and completely unique, made in one sample only, to make you feel special. Since there is a lot of hand stitching involved in making a Candy, it takes approximately 1 - 2 weeks (depending on the model) to finish one bag. Each bag is made with joy and excitement, and sometimes out of the desire to materialize the vision as soon as possible, small imperfections may occur. Please take that as a part of their charm. The Candies are delicate creatures. Please treat them as such. A lot of work, time and love goes into making each single Candy.. Give back the love it deserves..  VENA&nbsp;<em>candy<\/em>&nbsp;hopes you feel nothing but joy, when wearing your Candy.
