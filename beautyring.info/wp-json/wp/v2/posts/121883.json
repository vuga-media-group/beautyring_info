Rosolie, often referred to as the \u201cIndiana Jones of the Amazon\u201d, is a naturalist, conservationist, and swashbuckling explorer with a taste for danger and a passion for saving the Earth&#8217;s wild places and their inhabitants. Rosolie\u2019s mission \u2013 and that of the series \u2013 is to save the planet before its too late, sounding the alarm for how fast we are losing biodiversity, decimating animal species, and burning jungles, \u201cleaving no future for humanity.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The Junglekeepers will be available worldwide, with distribution discussions ongoing with notable premium streaming platforms and cable networks. On each one-hour episode of The Junglekeepers, Rosolie will welcome that week\u2019s newest guest conservationist \u2013 a CEO, A-list celebrity, philanthropist, head of state, or other dignitary \u2013 then, together with his team of world-renowned guides, vets, conservationists, security forces, and more, they will tackle a mission head-on: saving elephants in Kenya, battling wildfires in the Amazon, infiltrating rhino poachers in the Congo, and countless other journeys \u2013 all aimed at stopping or slowing this existential threat. Holstein said, &#8220;this series will be real, raw, unflinchingly honest \u2013 and, with an amazing cast and unique audience engagement component \u2013 unlike anything else on television. It&#8217;s an absolute game changer at a time when one is needed.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Rosolie, who captivates the attention of hundreds of thousands on his Instagram feed, where a typical day often includes wrestling anacondas, saving rhinos, befriending elephants, and hanging with butterflies, frogs, and monkeys never before seen by most humans said, \u201cin order to illustrate what we stand to lose, I want to demonstrate what an incredible, beautiful, and exciting world we live in. This will be an expedition, a personal journey, and a great adventure across the globe. It also needs to drive home the urgency and brutality of what is happening to animals and places right now. This is a journey that can get very dark \u2013 at times devastating and always catalyzing \u2013 but it is also fun, exciting, and inspiring.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The deck for The Junglekeepers &#8212; featuring episodes and a small sample of the incredible talent attached to the project &#8212; is now readily available (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/JKDeck\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/bit.ly\/JKDeck<\/a>) and a thrilling sizzle reel is available on special request.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nPAUL ROSOLIE has lived to tell the tale of how he survived contracting a fatal tropical disease, wrestled jaguars, and was eaten alive by an anaconda. He is the author of the novel, The Girl and the Tiger, and his memoir, Mother of God, which was hailed by Jane Goodall as \u201cgripping,\u201d and called \u201cawe inspiring\u201d by Bear Grylls. Rosolie is the founder and director of Junglekeepers, a Peruvian NGO that protects over 50,000 acres of threatened rainforest on the Las Piedras River, Peru. He has appeared on countless TV shows, been the subject of award-winning documentaries, and his conservation writing has appeared in National Geographic, The Huffington Post, and The Guardian.<\/p>\n<p>MICHAEL HOLSTEIN began his career writing on HBO\u2019s The Wire and working in marketing on films such as The Rock and Independence Day. Holstein next went on to oversee hundreds of shows, including In Performance at the White House, The PBS NewsHour, Finding Your Roots and the documentaries of Ken Burns. Later, as President and Chief Content Officer for The Content Farm, he was in charge of developing, curating, directing, and producing award-winning content for cable, digital, and linear TV including NBC, Netflix, Bravo, Ovation, National Geographic, PBS, and the Travel Channel. Among many honors, his series Live at 9:30 was shortlisted for a Producer\u2019s Guild Award; his film, Soccer in the City won awards and was selected for numerous festivals; and in 2019 he received the Mayor\u2019s Arts Award for Excellence in Media Arts (the highest honor Washington DC bestows on media producers). Holstein is a regularly featured lecturer at Georgetown University, American University, UCLA, and The University of Miami (where he was communications major), and is a member of the Producer\u2019s Guild of America, the Grammys, and the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.
