The programme involves communication with people from all walks of life, including the government, business community, and NGOs, resulting in cross-sector and cross-departmental cooperation.<\/p>\n<p>Three rounds of rigorous evaluations were conducted by a group of judges over four days. The selection process considered factors such as innovation, feasibility, uniqueness, attractiveness, and sustainable business models. Seven business plans were then selected to receive subsidies from Sands China, in support of the Macao SAR government&#8217;s revitalisation strategy. Disbursed in four stages, the awarded subsidies are up to twice the enterprises&#8217; initial capital investment, capped at MOP 1 million, in order to encourage their sustainable development.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. <span class=\"xn-person\">Wilfred Wong<\/span>, executive vice chairman of Sands China Ltd., said: &#8220;We received an overwhelming response and support from all walks of life after the announcement of the project. Judges from various professions carefully selected seven exceptional projects to establish their businesses at Rua das Estalagens. We hope that this group of aspiring and creative local residents will use the energy and enthusiasm of youth to bring a new atmosphere to the neighbourhood. This project belongs to the people of <span class=\"xn-location\">Macao<\/span>, and it brings together the power of government, business, and the community, and holds hope for the future. Every step that we take shoulders the important mission of revitalising the old district. With common beliefs and goals, combined with practical actions, we are working together to reactivate the vitality of Rua das Estalagens and mobilise the economic energy in the neighbourhood in pursuit of sustainable development.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Programme applicants needed to have a minimum of MOP 300,000 in capital to embark on the entrepreneurial journey based on their own ability and ideas, and establish their businesses on Rua das Estalagens.<\/p>\n<p>After Sands China announced the programme at an <span class=\"xn-chron\">April 8<\/span> press conference, the company held seven related activities, including seminars, an open day, and entrepreneurship training courses on marketing writing and pitching. The activities attracted more than 600 participants over the 72-day period leading up to the final review date. After the selected projects successfully settle in the neighbourhood, Sands China plans to launch the second phase of the project based on the actual situation of the neighbourhood and store operations.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Cheang Kai Meng<\/span>, acting president of the Cultural Affairs Bureau of the Macao SAR (IC), said: &#8220;With the launch of the Entrepreneurship Recruitment Programme for Rua das Estalagens, Sands China has made great efforts in showcasing the uniqueness of the historic street while attracting <span class=\"xn-location\">Macao<\/span> residents to start their businesses in a bid to rejuvenate the neighbourhood.
