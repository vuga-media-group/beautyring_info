Featured talent and shows to date have included art from <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/al-diaz.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Al Diaz<\/a>, famed Jean-Michel Basquiat collaborator, \u201cThe Rise and Fall\u2026 of Jean Calude Van Damme\u201d, which the NY Times called \u201cGleefully juvenile!\u201d, and weekly performances by Cirkus Moxie.

As a sustainability and social justice leader in the hospitality space she is helping to prioritize practices like pursuing zero waste, while working with co-Executive Directors Isaac Bush and Alex Orthwein to identify and partner with BIPOC and women-owned \/ led suppliers and organizations.<\/p>\n<p>Together, Bush and Orthwein built Brooklyn Art Haus to serve as a hub for creatives across Brooklyn, New York, and beyond. To support the versatile performance spaces, they envisioned Cafe de Artistes reminiscent of European cafe culture. From a 9am coffee to a 2am disco party, the cafe is a place to fill up with conversation about a just wrapped show over a delicious Mediterranean fare and luscious elixirs, crafted with care by GM Ronnie Pessin &#8211; Syndicated Bar and Theater (BK), PYT and B\u00e5coShop (Los Angeles). It all takes place against a backdrop of an ongoing gallery rotation of visual artists in partnership with curators Silvertuna Studios <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/silvertunastudios.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http:\/\/silvertunastudios.com<\/a> and Collect With Lulu <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/collectwithlulu.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http:\/\/collectwithlulu.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn response to watching small theaters and studios close during the pandemic, we were inspired to build Brooklyn Art Haus. It is a love letter to the artistic process. This organization is a home base for innovation and multiculturalism that speaks to the moment. It offers a different producing practice that focuses on equity, support, and the continued generation of work. We are a place for dialogue and ACTION!\u201d &#8211; Isaac Bush, Co-Executive Director<\/p>\n<p>To date, Brooklyn Art Haus has executed 35+ shows, hosting over 5000 people in its performance spaces, gallery, and Cafe de Artistes.<\/p>\n<p>Highly recommend stopping in and experiencing a show [at Brooklyn Art Haus, just] a bit off the beaten path. If you want Wicked, go to [Broadway], if you want something truly unique, go to BK Art Haus. If you&#8217;re considering popping in, don&#8217;t think, just go.&#8221; &#8211; Morgan, Patron<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Came for a drink and some small bites. Food was unique and very tasty. Service was wonderful. Will be back to catch a show soon!&#8221; &#8211; Jonathan, Patron<\/p>\n<p>To build on its artistic bedrock, Brooklyn Art Haus will prioritize partnering with nonprofits and community organizers to drive change outside of the stage and gallery. Early partnerships have focused on bolstering the work of Indie theater groups like League of Independent Theaters and Indie Space, offering free studio space, consultation, and other resources. Future partnerships will draw cohesive ties between the themes of the art and the work people are doing in communities. Brooklyn Art Haus is open and excited to connect with individuals and organizations who are prioritizing action across issues, whether it be on behalf of the Black Lives Matter, supporting queer artists, education access, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Brooklyn Art Haus is proud to be an independent performance center inspired by and here for the community it serves.<\/p>\n<p>A full schedule of performances and events for July and August 2023 can be found here. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bkarthaus.com\/performances\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.bkarthaus.com\/performances<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Brooklyn Art Haus and Caf\u00e9 des Artistes will be open Sunday-Thursday from 9:00am-midnight, and Friday-Saturday from 9:00am-2:00am \u2013 and is located at 20 Marcy Ave, Brooklyn NY 11211.<\/p>\n<p>Current programming includes, but is not limited to: Monday&#8217;s Squirrel Comedy Theater (UCB alums and programmers), Tuesday&#8217;s Cabaret\/Variety show called Fantastic Future Funhaus, and the world premiere of Invulnerable Nothing&#8217;s production called Galatea 2.0, a US\/UK co-production.
