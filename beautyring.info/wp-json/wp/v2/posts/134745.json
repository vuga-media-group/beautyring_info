The growth is attributed to the increasing demand for commercial and residential construction around the world and the extensive use of metallic materials in the construction process. The non-metallic segment, on the other hand, is projected to estimate the fastest CAGR of 5.7% throughout the forecast period. The growth is attributed to the on-metallic materials that offer a lot of great benefits, like heat insulation, sound insulation, fire protection, and stability.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The new installation segment to dominate the market during the forecast period-<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Based on installation type, the new installation segment held the largest market share in 2021, accumulating nearly three-fifths of the global air duct market revenue, and is predicted to retain its dominance during the forecast period. This is due to the global population rapidly expanding and urbanization accelerating. However, the retrofits segment would showcase the highest CAGR of 4.9% throughout the forecast period. This is because the extensive use of HVAC systems in the food processing and the pharmaceutical industry has caused the equipment to deteriorate and necessitate retrofitting.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Buy This Research Report @\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=aojiCZHrc-DrWryBLeRv2U3KvspjhDau2n5_FSA-KdDWwqH5A-f4ybf2nLgScJA8q54Uany_4ilWGlE8Y29GI1x0D2goeZ3Vo2wV7x_bhCWHn__t0gpE63I7OKpfiTB4L6dCQxs7apXk3aIYPsMYq18m6uVHczJzD3qY_WEiBuRX0f8RCbdgcKKURstQ49M_MXiH4xMkg9su8uK59y5aBWIM7AUaHCrdzFLWMMI_3pcxO6HQFfYorGbji9IWcUzt\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/checkout-final\/7346266b4f1d3289b5e7a95f807abe49<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The commercial segment to rule the roost by 2031-<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By end-user industry, the commercial segment held the major market share in 2021, contributing to more than two-fifths of the global air duct market revenue, and is projected to rule the roost by 2031.
