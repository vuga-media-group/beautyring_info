This event will showcase the cinematic achievements of Kurdistan and its global diaspora, spotlighting 17 exceptional films created by talented filmmakers who share the rich tapestry of Kurdish heritage.<\/p>\n<p>The founder of the New York Kurdish Film Festival, Ms. Xeyal Qertel, a distinguished Kurdish woman, educator and resident of New York, expressed her vision for the festival, stating, \u201cOur goal is to ensure audiences in New York City are exposed to Kurdish film, culture, and the resilience of our people. Through the power of cinema and cultural events, we aim to illuminate the beauty and struggles of the Kurdish identity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ticket holders have the opportunity to meet the filmmakers, and other artists in-person. The New York Kurdish Cultural Center will also host an opening weekend reception featuring traditional Kurdish food and chai. <\/p>\n<p>Marking an essential moment in history, this year\u2019s festival has been strategically timed to honor the enduring spirit of Kurdish resistance, commemorating 100 years since the Lausanne Treaty. The treaty resulted in the division of Kurdistan among countries like Turkey, and eventually Iraq and Syria, which were mandates of Great Britain and France, respectively. This year\u2019s NY Kurdish Film Festival aims not only to spread awareness but also to celebrate the indomitable will of the Kurdish people who have steadfastly resisted oppression despite facing historical injustices.<\/p>\n<p>A Journey Through Kurdish Culture and History<\/p>\n<p>Spanning a wide spectrum of genres, the festival will feature documentaries, dramas, and short films, live Kurdish music, a program for children, and a govend\u2014traditional Kurdish circle dancing&#8211;performance. A Kurdish American novelist will give a talk on his new book. Attendees will also be treated to Kurdish cuisine. With a dedicated focus on unearthing the essence of Kurdish culture, history, and the ongoing struggle for freedom, this event promises to be a transformative cultural journey.<\/p>\n<p>The opening night of the festival will witness the screening of the profoundly poignant film \u201cThe Pasha, My Mother, and I.\u201d This evocative creation by filmmaker Nevine Gerits pays homage to her mother, Pervin, who hailed from a noble Kurdish family and dedicated her life to tireless activism in pursuit of Kurdish freedom. Through this film viewers will gain intimate insights into Pervin\u2019s journey, making it a deeply personal and historically significant experience. Nevine will join the festival for an audience discussion.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond the opening film, the festival boasts an array of compelling cinematic works. Hailing from West Kurdistan, Rojava, filmmakers like R\u00eager Azad Kaya, Sevinaz Evdike, and Manal Masri will present the captivating films \u201cWhen the Seedlings Grow,\u201d \u201cThe Wedding Parade,\u201d and \u201cTouching Freedom,\u201d respectively. From North Kurdistan, Bakur, a powerful documentary titled \u201cTearing Walls Down\u201d sheds light on several imprisoned Kurdish women politicians, while \u201cThe Wheel\u201d by Met\u00een Ewr memorializes an episode of Kurdish resistance in the early 1990s. East Kurdistan, Rojhelat, will contribute, among others, \u201cHope\u201d by Mozghan Kavousi, an accomplished activist venturing into directing for the first time. Iraqi Kurdistan will be well represented with films like \u201cThe Hole in the Wall\u201d by Bilal Korkut, offering insightful explorations of different facets of Kurdish life and struggle. Filmmakers from Iraqi Kurdistan will travel to New York City to participate in-person.<\/p>\n<p>Several directors will offer Q&amp;As after their film is shown, either live or virtually.<\/p>\n<p>The film festival selection committee and volunteers represent the entire Kurdish diaspora, as well as American friends of the Kurdish community. The New York Kurdish Culture Center\u2014the parent organization of the film festival\u2014worked with the U.S. Embassy \u2013 Erbil Consulate for cultural visa processing for official invitees from Iraq.<\/p>\n<p>New York Kurdish Film Festival History:<\/p>\n<p>The New York Kurdish Film Festival, established in 2017, takes place every fall over several days.
