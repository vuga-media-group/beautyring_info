The world of Connor and Mishti, two young Red Pandas, expands with the friendship of a pangolin and guidance from a wise Sarus Crane, leading children through a story brimming with friendship, sacrifice, and courage.<\/p>\n<p>In this timeless narrative, young readers are both entertained and guided on the values of camaraderie and resilience, while also exploring the delicate intricacies of our natural world \u2013 themes that are poignant and essential in today&#8217;s climate.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the pages, brought to life by the talented illustrator Xinting Guo, children will discover a world where the playful strokes of art bring to life the lush habitats and the endearing personalities of animals that need our attention the most \u2013 the endangered species. The delightful mix of abstract and realistic art captures imaginations and sparks conversations between children and parents about the joy in the moment, the significance of friendship, and the pressing necessity to protect our environment.<\/p>\n<p>When reflecting on the motivations behind &#8220;Red Pandas Journey to Sikkim,&#8221; author Celia Straus shares insights into the powerful blend of nature&#8217;s wonder and the urgency of conservation that sparked the birth of this enchanting story. &#8220;As a child my favorite books were always about animals, from Winnie the Pooh to Charlotte&#8217;s Web. Now, with six young grandchildren of my own, and a passion to do what little I can to save endangered species, it is my deepest pleasure to be able to tell this story aided by the brilliance of Xinting Guo&#8217;s illustrations. Pangolins are the most heavily trafficked animal on earth. Red Pandas are quickly becoming extinct. But between the covers of this little book, they demonstrate the value of friendships,show great courage, take joy in the moment and, finally,find safety.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>The acclaim for &#8220;Red Pandas Journey to Sikkim&#8221; echoes far and wide, as evidenced by the glowing endorsements from critics and reviewers alike. Here&#8217;s what a few have to say:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis book could be particularly useful for introverted children, as it shows why having friends is joyful and important, not just for themselves, but for others in their time of need. Overall, this is an excellent picture book for preschool and elementary-age kids.\u201d \u2013 Michaela Gordoni, Reader Views<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRed Pandas Journey to Sikkim is a MUST READ for parents and their kiddos. The amazing writing and beautiful drawings tell a story of friendship and adventure. My 4-year-old girl and 2-year-old son were entranced the whole time!!!\u201d \u2013 Amazon Review<\/p>\n<p>\u201cStraus&#8217;s beautifully written narrative brings the characters to life, demonstrating the importance of resilience, environmental awareness, and the power of friendship. Xinting Guo&#8217;s illustrations are visually charming, bringing the characters to life with vivid colours and attention to detail.\u201d \u2013 Amazon Review<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI love the illustrations and the story in this book. The red panda is illustrated in a vivid and beautiful way! A wonderful children\u2019s book!\u201d \u2013 Amazon Review<\/p>\n<p>A pivotal aspect of this book&#8217;s journey is its humanitarian footprint.
