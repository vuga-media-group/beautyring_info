Recognizing these signs is crucial for preserving dental wellness and overall quality of life.<\/p>\n<p>Structural Integrity of Teeth<\/p>\n<p>Tooth Decay<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nStatistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveal that nearly one in five seniors in the U.S. suffers from untreated tooth decay. While sugary and acidic foods are the most commonly known culprits, aging factors such as thinning enamel, root exposure, along with medication side effects including dry mouth,  harmful bacteria in the mouth and weaker immune systems greatly increase risks.  Additionally, compromised manual dexterity hinders effective brushing and flossing, increasing the risk of decay. Why is this important? Simply put, everyday events such as being able to enjoy eating and chewing favorite foods, laughing and smiling without being self conscious are much more difficult to do with   weakened and damaged teeth. <\/p>\n<p>Professional cleanings are essential in combating tooth decay. Dental teams provide more than just cleaning\u2014they offer personalized oral hygiene regimens tailored to each patient\u2019s needs, effectively removing plaque and tartar buildup and strengthening enamel to fortify teeth against decay. Essentially making sure your teeth are able to function for a lifetime.<\/p>\n<p>Missing Teeth<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe inevitability of tooth loss as humans age underscores the importance of proactive dental care. Approximately 20% of seniors aged 65 and above have lost all their natural teeth, which poses challenges beyond aesthetics. Missing teeth can impair speech and chewing and lead to long-term jaw complications, necessitating prompt attention.<\/p>\n<p>Restorative dentistry offers solutions such as dental implants, bridges, and dentures to restore function and aesthetics for seniors with missing teeth.  <\/p>\n<p>Gum Health Management and Treatment<\/p>\n<p>Receding Gums <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nNatural aging can lead to receding gums, exposing tooth roots, and increasing sensitivity. Poor brushing habits or teeth grinding can exacerbate this condition, increasing vulnerability to decay and escalating the risk of gum disease and tooth loss if left untreated. <\/p>\n<p>Specialized gum disease therapy uses targeted interventions to effectively address receding gums. These techniques are tailored to individual needs and aim to restore gum health, reduce sensitivity, and prevent further complications. <\/p>\n<p>Gum and Periodontal Disease<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nPlaque buildup is a persistent threat that catalyzes gum disease, starting with reversible gingivitis and potentially progressing to irreversible periodontitis and destruction of jaw bone that holds teeth in the mouth.  Without intervention, periodontitis can erode soft tissue and bone, leading to tooth loss\u2014a serious concern among aging adults. Think of it as the foundation of a beautiful house being washed away. As bone washes away around teeth, the foundation is weakened or gone and tooth loss may be inevitable. Furthermore periodontal disease has been linked to heart disease and can affect overall health.<\/p>\n<p>Advanced periodontal infection therapy addresses gum disease, managing it and preserving teeth AND its supporting structure through personalized treatment plans. Continuously monitoring and follow up of gum issues is very important as there is no cure for periodontal disease. <\/p>\n<p>Dry Mouth Issues in Seniors<\/p>\n<p>Dry Mouth<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAlthough not an inherent consequence of aging, seniors are more susceptible to dry mouth, often due to medication side effects or respiratory issues. Reduced saliva production accelerates dental problems, creating a high decay risk, pain, and ultimately weak teeth. <\/p>\n<p>Comprehensive dental checkups can identify the underlying causes of dry mouth. Tailored solutions, including therapeutic mouthwashes and saliva substitutes, help alleviate discomfort and promote oral health. <\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.carolinasmiling.com\/contact-us\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Schedule a consultation<\/a> with Carolina Family Dentistry today for further information on senior dental health needs.
