Rudy and Steve&#8217;s tragic passing due to Covid in 2020 and 2022, respectively, has left a void in the music industry, but the Salas family has made the decision to keep their music alive for now through \u201cTierra Legacy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tierra has had a remarkable career spanning generations and includes chart-topping hits. The band was named &#8220;Best R&amp;B Vocal Group&#8221; by four leading magazines, including Billboard, in the early 1980s. They began their career in East Los Angeles with a unique blend of rock, pop, jazz, R&amp;B, and salsa, creating an infectious Latin\/R&amp;B rhythm that produced classics such as &#8220;Together,&#8221; &#8220;Gonna Find Her\u201d and &#8220;Memories,&#8221; Tierra was also the first Latino\/American band to have four songs on national charts and two simultaneously in the Top 100.<\/p>\n<p>Tierra&#8217;s legacy lives on through the band&#8217;s new iteration, \u201cTierra Legacy\u201d, wholly owned by the Salas family. The band includes David Salas (Rudy&#8217;s son), Richard Salas (Rudy and Steve&#8217;s brother), original and longtime members who created the hit songs for Tierra, and two fresh and exciting new lead singers. Tierra Legacy continues to captivate fans with a strong social media presence, extraordinary live shows and new music, keeping the dynamic and unforgettable band alive.<\/p>\n<p>It is essential to note that Joanna Salas, Rudy&#8217;s wife at the time of his death, is currently being sued in Los Angeles Superior Court by the Salas family for misleading the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The claim as to ownership of the trademark is the subject of pending litigation: Los Angeles County Probate Case No. 22STPB08383 and Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. 21STCV25207.
