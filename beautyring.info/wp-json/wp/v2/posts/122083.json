Moreover, the rising usage of alpha olefins as paper-sizing chemicals, biodiesel, synthetic lubricants, plasticizers, and oil-field chemicals, is expected to create several growth opportunities for the alpha olefins market during the forecast years. However, the cost involved in the raw materials and manufacturing of the components is projected to hinder the growth of the market in the upcoming years.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=zXEdBWYWW_TLA0tl6HKUiwsKJeq-e_GORtRuMqfDQThA7Vp8sRaS8jzQxziVliw00UAC15yMkQeKXgs3_FmkAHoZBZizbbuF8nXs12TXPm8cWhXSIODUxP4_qEZj5YjKKpEkQss30DZ5y9RSt-SO1ufawTuVpmr57NiOKSbs_L-dSLP9NFIDvhW_SCultBb3UnOK9kzULEmKoy-pAQwCYjO23AXFgyizibCpFVYCqWg=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>Request an Exclusive PDF Sample of the Alpha Olefins Market (Including Tables, TOC, and Figures)<\/b><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Segments of the Alpha Olefins Market\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The report has divided the market into segments based on product, application, and region.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Product: 1-Hexene Sub-Segment to be <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>Most Productive\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The 1-hexene sub-segment accounted for the largest market share in 2021. The increasing use of 1-hexene as a co-monomer to produce polyethylene and plasticizers due to the rising expansion of the packaging industry is predicted to drive the growth of the sub-segment during the forecast period.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Application: Polyethylene Sub-Segment to be <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>Most Profitable\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The polyethylene sub-segment generated the highest share in the alpha olefins market in 2021. This is mainly because polyethylene is considered the most significant polyolefin plastic owing to its processing, chemical, and mechanical stability. Moreover, the increasing demand for polyethylene in packaging materials such as films, plastic bottles, bags, and containers is expected to boost the growth of the sub-segment during the forecast period.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Region: North America <\/b><b>Market<\/b><b> to Hold the Maximum Share of the Market\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The North America region is expected to hold the largest share of the alpha olefins market during the forecast period. This is mainly due to the rising implementation of technological advancements and expansions in the alpha olefins sector in the region to improve their profit margin. In addition, the availability of cheap raw materials and the extraction of shale gas across the region are factors expected to drive the regional growth of the market during the forecast period.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=03N9n9fUxCGojfVM9DTZ-JztW7IKuWv5FrZTAbLzxedg4qBtgM6mBtI-wI3IjnUbhIb_Y0O_XODuxMWqKwFJrir0EZAREDIAKTg2aTodT2i3fe99BruIAPqIxkwT0wqofGzEPfCOdGUJWx_PqLi4pkckZvCYOpmDYqtfctWhvrm6ByKXCzI--rK1CeLGCnysaYbJQlU4BI34xkGqyml20fyH7CJtbKnQbKp8asy6_10=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>Ask an Expert Analyst or Schedule a call to Get the Latest Trends on Alpha Olefins Market<\/b><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>COVID<\/b><b>-19 <\/b><b>impact<\/b><b> on the Alpha Olefins Market\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has brought several uncertainties across various industries.
