Integrating 17 manufacturers into a seamless inventory ordering and management experience, 'AIMS' is now available and on-display at \"The Exchange\" -- the largest gathering of forward-thinking independent eye doctors in the world. AIMS 2.0 Inventory Management Systems for Eyewear with RFID See the AIMS 2.0 Inventory Management Systems for Eyewear with RFID on display at The Exchange 2023 in San Antonio DALLAS, April 10, 2023 (Newswire.com) - Vision Source's yearly gathering, \"The Exchange,\" happens from April 19-22 in San Antonio. More than 3,000 independent optometrists and opticians gather to discover the latest advancements for their optical offices. The AIMS Eyewear Order Management System will be demoing the latest RFID-enabled system for eye doctors. The AIMS system is powered by SimplyRFiD's Wave enterprise inventory system and optimized for eye doctors by the Frame Source Group. AIMS gives eye doctors the ability to compete with online and big-box retail by offering in-person try-ons, fast delivery, and a huge frame selection of 100,000 frames never before seen. \"Ever wonder why the frame you want or saw on a celebrity isn't there? Because 'best sellers' only last on the board for one day!\" said Greg Smith, head of sales for Frame Source. \"With AIMS, the best sellers go back on the board, and AIMS handles ordering a fresh frame directly from the manufacturer. With AIMS, the best frames are always in stock.\" AIMS is directly integrated with 17 manufacturers sending stock levels and providing online ordering and drop shipping for optometrists. Integrated Manufacturers: A&A * Charmant * Design Eyewear Eight to Eighty Eyewear * Europa * Iconyx * Kenmark * L'Amy * Luxottica Match Eyewear * Modern Optical * MODO * Mondottica * Morel * Riserva\/FSD * Tura * WestGroupe * * offer same-day shipping on all frame orders These manufacturers represent the top brands with more than 100,000 frame choices. Sample brands include Ann Taylor, Burberry, Chanel, Dolce, Oakley, Persol, Ralph Lauren, Ray-Ban, Riserva, SuperFlex and hundreds more. At the Show A hands-on demo is available to experience how RFID reduces inventory time from one day to one minute. In attendance will be Carl Brown, President of SimplyRFiD, and Greg Smith, head of sales for Frame Source Group. A virtual demo from last year's Exchange is on TikTok.
