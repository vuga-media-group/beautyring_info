AHLA is calling on the council to hold an economic impact hearing as soon as possible and to enact a resolution in opposition to Unite Here&#8217;s homeless in hotels ballot measure to more clearly inform the public of the council&#8217;s stance on the measure.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Homelessness is a serious and complex problem that can only be addressed by professional social and health care workers with specialized\u00a0training. Unite Here&#8217;s insistence on forcing hotel workers and guests to deal with this issue is dangerous,&#8221; <b>said AHLA President &amp; CEO <span class=\"xn-person\">Chip Rogers<\/span>. <\/b>&#8220;If Unite Here succeeds in turning all LA hotels into homeless shelters, eventually there will be no hotels \u2013 and no hotel workers \u2013 left in the city. Safety concerns will prevent workers from taking hotel jobs and drive tourists to other locations. That&#8217;s a fact, and these poll results prove it.\u00a0That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re calling on Unite Here to drop its dangerous demand to turn hotels into homeless shelters \u2013 in LA or any other city where they might try it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To schedule an interview with an AHLA representative to discuss Unite Here&#8217;s fight to force hotels to house homeless people next to paying guests, email <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection#046961606d6544656c68652a676b69\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"5e333b3a373f1e3f36323f703d3133\">[email\u00a0protected]<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><b>Morning Consult survey methodology<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>The survey by Morning Consult on behalf of AHLA was conducted <span class=\"xn-chron\">Sept. 18-20, 2023<\/span>, among 2,203 U.S. adults across the country.
