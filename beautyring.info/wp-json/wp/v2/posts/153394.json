However, her enthusiasm quickly turned to distress as she became the target of severe workplace harassment. <\/p>\n<p>Despite seeking support from the firm administration and experienced colleagues, Gordon found herself isolated and without recourse or mentorship. Prominent employment attorneys informed her that she could either fight for justice or maintain her career, but not both. This disheartening advice led Gordon to leave the legal profession, a decision that haunted her for years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d is a compelling narrative that combines memoir and journalism. Gordon shares preserved memos, emails, handwritten notes from that challenging time, and new interviews with former colleagues, industry insiders, and experts in hostile work environments. The book provides a raw and honest reflection on gender discrimination and abuse of power in Big Law.<\/p>\n<p>According to Gordon, the memoir\u2019s cover alone is an if-you-know-you-know nod to the California legal community, featuring the distinctive floor tiles of San Francisco\u2019s Embarcadero Center, where Gordon spent three years in Big Law. However, her first year at Schiffer Mulligan forms the crux of \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gordon\u2019s decision to document her experiences serves as both a personal catharsis and a public service. By finally giving voice to her younger self, she validates the experiences of many who have faced similar challenges in Big Law and other professions. The book quickly climbed to the number one spot on Amazon\u2019s list of lawyer and judge memoirs, resonating deeply with readers in all industries who appreciate its unflinching honesty and critical examination of workplace culture.<\/p>\n<p>In a five-star review on Amazon, Heather Rosnow, remarked, \u201cThis book is hard to put down. I read it in two days. I am not a lawyer but I have been harassed on the job, suffered trauma and heartbreak. I could relate in so many different ways.\u201d Another reviewer commented, \u201cIt&#8217;s easy to condemn outright assault, but the more subtle workplace bullying described in this book often goes under the radar and can have lasting scars.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For more information about Erin Gordon and her work, visit her website at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.eringordonauthor.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.eringordonauthor.com<\/a>  or connect with her on LinkedIn at Erin Gordon.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Erin Gordon<br \/>Erin Gordon, Writer &amp; Editor<br \/>+1 415-309-7733<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/719409023\/mailto:Erin@ErinGordonAuthor.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Erin@ErinGordonAuthor.com<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ErinGordonAuthor\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/leslieagordon\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/eringordonsf\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=DKGPuszpYDY4E1kn&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      June 12, 2024, 15:23 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/719409023\/new-book-exposes-toxic-power-in-big-law\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
