She is a serial entrepreneur. Besides her main passion of art and fashion.

What do Fashion and Style mean to you? And what motto do you have?<\/strong><\/p><p><em style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Oxana De Castro: <\/em><em>Fashion and style are two different things! Fashion is what are the current trends now. Something that is cool today, but probably not going to be cool tomorrow. Style is something particular to a certain individual, something that one cant put a finger on, but seen and felt right away. To me style is much more important than fashion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Style is lasting and continues through all fashion trends. One can dress in all the latest trends and most expensive fashion items but still lucking of style. I stick to two personal mottos:&nbsp;I improve the world by enjoying it&nbsp;and A grateful heart is the foundation for all other virtues.&nbsp;Both reflect deep in me.<\/em><\/p><p><strong>What inspired you to start your career as a designer?&nbsp;What gave you pause?<\/strong><\/p><p><em>I dont consider myself a designer. I can be in the role of designer, a manager, an artist, sales person, PR person and list is long. Generally, I dont like to put any label on myself. But if I need to put one professional tag on myself that would be  an entrepreneur. I created FOXYLAB NEW YORK just because I have been always passionate about fashion and art, so in combining these together I found myself. I wanted clothing with the deeper meaning and now FOXYLAB is more than just a clothing brand but multifunctional platform for inspiration&nbsp;and discovery for all creative minds.<\/em><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_Oxana_De_Castro_FXLB_streetwear-4_1659850730.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV Oxana De Castro FXLB streetwear 4 1659850730 jpg\"><\/p><p><strong>What was the most difficult obstacle you had to overcome in launching your brand and other businesses?<\/strong><\/p><p><em>There are two most difficult obstacles for me. First is to find a passionate and qualified team  this is a high importance for any business. One can have many amazing ideas, however persuading those without reliable team is simply impossible. Second is to find a reliable and quality product manufacturer. It took me multiple mistakes and years to find it. This is a huge obstacle in the fashion industry.<\/em><\/p><p><em><span class=\"ql-cursor\"><\/span><\/em><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_Oxana_De_Castro_FXLB_streetwear-3_1659851310.JPG\" alt=\"24Fashion TV Oxana De Castro FXLB streetwear 3 1659851310 JPG\"><\/p><p><strong>Your latest collection,Disclosing Athletes Creativity, is incredible! How did you come up with the idea to collaborate with international athletes and artists and to release such a unique drop?<\/strong><\/p><p><em>Our <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/foxylabny.com\/dac\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external sponsored\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"><em>new collection <\/em><\/a><em>was inspired by Tokyo summer Olympics. It was March 2021 and first post covid Olympics were coming. It was lots of conversations around it and this subject came up during the lunch with my team member. She mentioned that athletes are artists in their nature too. That was a start. That lunch led us to the idea to pare athletes who were coming to the Olympics with the international artists. So, they can create art in pair, and not just art but art with the meaning for both  artist and athlete. Each collaboration has a name and there is a meaning behind it. FOXYLAB monitored interaction between the pairs and helped to come to the desired art results. And as usual we used our t-shirts as a canvas for the final art of each pair.<\/em><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_FXLB_streetfashion-4_1659850768.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV FXLB streetfashion 4 1659850768 jpg\"><\/p><p><strong>What message do you think your style sends to your clientele? Who is your primary clientele?<\/strong><\/p><p><em>Our gender fluid seasonless streetwear styles bring the message of the&nbsp;freedom of expression coupled with a sense of belonging to the art community.&nbsp;We are artwear clothing brand and go to online source for inspiration and discovery how art and fashion coexists together. Our primary clientele are talented, courageous, free creatives and those who appreciate art. People with a street culture attitude and those who see fashion beyond just clothing, but instead as a part of the lifestyle.<\/em><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_FXLB_streetfashion-0_1659850791.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV FXLB streetfashion 0 1659850791 jpg\"><\/p><p><strong>Who are your favorite designers, fashion houses? Which of their creations do you like? Who wore them, when, etc?<\/strong><\/p><p><em>I have few favorites.&nbsp;Schiaparelli early and nowadays creations are one of my very favorite. For me this fashion house is the founder of art in fashion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Schiaparelli&nbsp;turned the fabric into a painting canvas and was first to collaborate with the best artists of those days. I love&nbsp;Schiaparellis lobster dress and shoe hat in collaboration with Salvador Dali. I know that for those times, these designs were shocking. Nowadays&nbsp;Schiaparelli didnt disappoint either and continues to flourish in fashion and art.&nbsp;I adore their iconic cone bustier.<\/em><\/p><p><em>Iris van Herpen creations are another favorite. Iris is an artist, a fashion legend who uses the best craftsmanship combined with the best digital technologies of today. Multiple world museums keep showing her work which is just another prove that everything she is doing is art.&nbsp;I love vintage Dior dresses with full skirts. It is less of art for me, but extra gorgeous haute couture that I have a weak spot to. It inspired me to create our tailored to measure dress. It stands out from all our pieces and was created for a special upcoming project. This dress was already worn by few famous people.<\/em><\/p><p><strong>Do you think the fashion business follows standard business cycles or does it have a periodicity of its own?&nbsp;What part of the cycle do you think we are in now?<\/strong><\/p><p><em>Fashion industry follows the standard business cycles with the same old formula steps - introduction of the trend, then trend rises, reaches its peak, and follows by decline.&nbsp;The only difference from the past, is that now the life span of the cycles became significantly shorter. This is the saddest part for me.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p><p><em>Trends rise and fell with the extremely fast speeds due to large competition, improved design technology, marketing tools and of course social media.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the unfortunate Catch 22 situation  there are many trends but they all start feeling mainstream very fast. So, the companies keep creating, competing, people keep spending, fashion brands doing more collections, there are more fashion weeks. We keep exhausting the system, ourselves and also keep carelessly treating the environment.<\/em><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_FXLB_streetfashion-2_1659850897.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV FXLB streetfashion 2 1659850897 jpg\"><\/p><p><strong>How recession-proof do you think the fashion industry is? What about your niche of the industry?<\/strong><\/p><p><em>Fashion is not recession proof, but the luxury fashion niche is recession proof.&nbsp;Those items are passed through generations and always in demand. People who have money still have them during the recession and are able to afford luxury items. With the recession it will be a decline in a consumer spending for fashion, less international trade. It will be more early markdowns&nbsp;and recession is definitely tough on already difficult business of fashion. Including our niche.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_FXLB_streetfashion-3_1659851093.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV FXLB streetfashion 3 1659851093 jpg\"><\/p><p><strong>Do you like social media and being in the public eye? Are there good and bad things about it and about the effect it has on the public?<\/strong><\/p><p><em>I dont mind social media. For professionals Instagram became a LinkedIn of our days and a great marketing tool. You are the one to choose how much and what to post about your life, so you can create any desired image. Social media is time-consuming, I am a true believer that one should balance its use just like everything else in life. Too much of anything becomes damaging. Plus, our generation should always be conscious not to compare perfect Instagram images to the real life. It is never the same.<\/em><\/p><p><strong>Whats next for you? New collections, collaborations, shows?
