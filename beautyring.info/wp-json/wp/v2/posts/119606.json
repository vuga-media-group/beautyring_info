In addition to providing access to valuable capital, Marriott is utilizing its extensive\u00a0relationships with seasoned hotel developers, operators and lenders to assist and support eligible owners&#8217; hotel projects.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We see hotel ownership as a powerful economic generator \u2013 creating good jobs and revenue in the community and an\u00a0on-ramp to prosperity and inter-generational wealth for hotel owners.
