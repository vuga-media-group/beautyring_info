Armstrong shared with podcast host Camille Milner how her book helps parents approach divorce consciously and thoughtfully. In a 3-part series of the podcast, she emphasizes the importance of protecting children during a divorce, offering proven co-parenting tips and discussing what it takes to have a \u201cgood divorce.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am not an advocate for divorce; I think couples should get married and stay married for the long term\u2014that was always my plan,\u201d Sarah Armstrong said. \u201cUnfortunately, things don\u2019t always work out as planned, and divorce is more common than ever. I just don\u2019t believe that divorce has to be a negative cloud that follows you, your children and your ex-spouse through their lives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A Collaborative Divorce (or \u201cgood divorce\u201d) protects children and preserves co-parenting relationships by seeking to remove animosity between ex-spouses and encouraging parents to be present and spend quality time with their children. It\u2019s a more peaceful process for resolving family law disputes where couples work with lawyers, divorce coaches, child specialists, mental health professionals and financial neutrals to craft their own divorce agreements. Decisions are made by the couple without going to court or involving a judge or other third-party decision maker.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Mom\u2019s Guide to a Good Divorce: What to Think Through When Children Are Involved\u201d offers key learnings meant to prepare parents for the decisions they need to make when considering a divorce, ranging from thinking through legal and financial considerations, to communicating with a former spouse, to envisioning their post-divorce lifestyle, all while keeping their children as the focus. <\/p>\n<p>Sarah Armstrong is a divorc\u00e9e, mother, mentor, author, volunteer and the vice president of global marketing operations at Google. Her personal mission is to offer insights and information to moms and dads about how they too can have a \u201cgood divorce.\u201d Her work has been recognized as industry leading around the world resulting in her being named one of Ad Age\u2019s \u201cWomen to Watch\u201d and her inclusion in Ad Age\u2019s Book of Tens (Top Ten Who Made Their Mark in 2009).
