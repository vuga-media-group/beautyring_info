said <span class=\"xn-person\">Chip Ohlsson<\/span>, chief development officer, Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts. &#8220;Adding MasterBUILT\u2014one of <span class=\"xn-location\">Canada&#8217;s<\/span> premier hotel development companies\u2014to that growing list speaks to the quality of the ECHO prototype and its highly efficient, ROI-driven design, which offers among the most rentable square-footage in the industry.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>Canadian Success Story<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>One of <span class=\"xn-location\">Canada&#8217;s<\/span> fastest growing hotel development and investment companies, MasterBUILT Hotels was founded in 2011 and has tremendous expertise in site evaluation, project design and project management\u2014having constructed over two dozen Microtel by Wyndham hotels spanning all 10 provinces, with additional hotels currently under development.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The success Wyndham is seeing with ECHO is not by chance\u2014it&#8217;s a testament to the care that was put into designing the brand,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">David Donaldson<\/span>, president and CEO, MasterBUILT Hotels. &#8220;From day one, Wyndham made a point of seeking the input of experienced developers and then actioning on their insights. The result is a brand that resonates as strongly with hotel developers as it will with guests. While other brands have since tried to tap into and mirror ECHO Suites&#8217; success\u2014Wyndham, with its unmatched scale, owner-first approach and industry-leading support\u2014continues to lead the pack.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>Unprecedented Growth<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>With the addition of MasterBUILT Hotels, ECHO Suites Extended Stay by Wyndham now has pipeline of 265 hotels across the U.S. and <span class=\"xn-location\">Canada<\/span>, making it one of the largest of any extended stay hotel brand. Multiple projects have already broken ground and are in various stages of construction across <span class=\"xn-location\">Virginia<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Texas<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">South Carolina<\/span>, with over a dozen more slated to break ground in the months ahead. The Company expects to have 100 hotels open over five years, with the brand&#8217;s first locations beginning to make a meaningful contribution to Wyndham&#8217;s overall portfolio in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose-built, all new-construction, 124-room ECHO Suites prototype requires under two acres of land and has a highly competitive cost per key. Coming in at approximately 50,000 square-feet, individual rooms average 300 square-feet. The rooms consist of single- and two-queen studio suites with kitchens as well as efficiently-designed public spaces\u2014a lobby, fitness center and 24\/7 guest laundry\u2014that help to limit labor needs.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on ECHO Suites Extended Stay by Wyndham, including development opportunities, visit\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wyndhamdevelopment.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.wyndhamdevelopment.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><b>About Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts (NYSE: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ticket-symbol\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#financial-modal\">WH<\/a>) is the world&#8217;s largest hotel franchising company by the number of properties, with approximately 9,100 hotels across over 95 countries on six continents.
