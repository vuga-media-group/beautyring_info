In the report, iXsystems was also named as a Customers\u2019 Choice for the North America region. This recognition is in addition to iXsystems\u2019 prior recognition as a Customers\u2019 Choice for the North America region in the 2024 and 2023 Voice of the Customer for Primary Storage2. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe \u2019Voice of the Customer\u2019 is a report that synthesizes Gartner Peer Insights\u2019 reviews into insights for IT decision-makers. This aggregated peer perspective, along with individual detailed reviews, is complementary to Gartner expert research and can play a key role in the buying process as it focuses on direct peer experiences of implementing and operating a solution.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Customer Experience rating for iXsystems in the Gartner report was 4.9 (25 Ratings) for Product Capabilities(23 Ratings), 4.9 for Support Experience (24 Ratings), 5.0 for Deployment Experience (23 Ratings), and 4.9 for Sales Experience (23 Ratings).<\/p>\n<p>According to one <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/reviews\/market\/distributed-file-systems-and-object-storage\/vendor\/ixsystems\/product\/truenas-enterprise\/review\/view\/5320226\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">customer review for iXsystem\u2019s TrueNAS Enterprise<\/a>, &#8220;We purchased this product to fill a gap we had for a large storage depot. We needed something that could provide scalable redundancy, snapshots\/versioning, and replication. The snapshots have worked well and saved us a lot of headaches. AD integration has been seamless for us. Support has been on point.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/reviews\/market\/distributed-file-systems-and-object-storage\/vendor\/ixsystems\/product\/truenas-enterprise\/review\/view\/4934456\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Another customer review stated<\/a>, \u201c \u201cThe process of getting TrueNAS integrated into our environment was smooth &amp; straightforward. I had to spec out a system that was suitable for our relatively tight budget, and we had to make some tweaking throughout the purchasing process to make it work. Nonetheless, our sales rep was very responsive through the process. We also have a closed network environment and needed some information to get updates and other communications working through our proxy. I asked the implementation person assigned to our company and he responded promptly and accurately &#8212; which I can honestly say is an exception among the vendors we work with! Most vendors don&#8217;t have the information on hand or don&#8217;t understand our network setup.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCustomer voices matter most, so no recognition means more to us than having them selecting iXsystems as a Customers\u2019 Choice for the North American region in two distinct Voice of the Customer reports,\u201d said Brett Davis, Executive Vice President for iXsystems. \u201cThe success of our customers and users remains our top priority as we help them leverage open storage to simplify operations and reduce cost while modernizing how they store and protect data.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>1 Gartner, Voice of the Customer for Distributed File Systems and Object Storage, 24 April 2024.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n2 Gartner, Voice of the Customer for Primary Storage, 23 March 2024.<\/p>\n<p>GARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and\/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally, and PEER INSIGHTS is a registered trademark of Gartner, Inc. and\/or its affiliates and are used herein with permission.
