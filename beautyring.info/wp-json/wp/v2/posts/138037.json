Stubis, whose book had already been awarded the highest rating of five stars by a Readers\u2019 Favorite reviewer, was honored on the stage of the Hilton Blue Lagoon Hotel in Miami in a ceremony attended by hundreds. <\/p>\n<p>The book takes readers on a dramatic adventure from cosmopolitan 1930s Shanghai to China\u2019s dusty and dangerous \u201cWild West,\u201d and is filled with fantastical but true tales of pirates, prophecies, babies sold in opium dens, and a love story between a man whose fate was said to be sealed before he was born and a woman with three identities. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce Our Lives\u201d was written by Chinese-American author Qin Sun Stubis, who was born in the squalor of a Shanghai shantytown, lived through the Great Chinese Famine and Cultural Revolution, and is now a Washington, D.C.-area writer, poet and newspaper columnist. The book follows the lives of two families over the course of nearly 100 years and chronicles the extraordinary lives of ordinary people living in the shadows of some of the greatest headlines of the 20th Century. <\/p>\n<p>This newest honor is part of a growing swell of praise and recognition for \u201cOnce Our Lives.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Debuting as an <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Once-Our-Lives-Creative-Non-Fiction\/dp\/1771837969\/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1699197357&amp;sr=8-1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Amazon<\/a> #1 New Release for 41 days, \u201cOnce Our Lives\u201d has been named a Gold Winner of the international Nonfiction Book Awards, the #1 winner of the PenCraft Book Awards for literary excellence in culture\/history, the 2023 Best Book Awards winner for cross-genre nonfiction, and a winner in the Readers\u2019 Favorite 2023 International Book Awards for cultural nonfiction.

She saw her defiantly honest father imprisoned for using the wrong words. Shunned as political pariahs, Qin and her family sustained themselves with books and stories of adventure and past glory. With the help of a borrowed radio, an eccentric British teacher, and a fortuitous assignment as a library assistant, Qin discovered and fell in love with Western literature, committing to memory the strange but beautiful sounds of Keats, Wordsworth, and Lincoln. <\/p>\n<p>But it was in bed late each night, after scouring local parks for enough firewood to cook the family\u2019s meal of rice, that Qin and her three small sisters heard the dramatic stories that make up this book. The four girls listened to their mother, an aspiring actress in the early days of Asian cinema, recount colorful tales of pirates, prophecies, fortunes won and lost, babies sold in opium dens, glorious lives and gruesome deaths. Based on actual experiences and family lore from the Post-Imperial to Post-Cultural Revolution eras, these stories represent a wealth of colorful but largely overlooked Chinese history. <\/p>\n<p>Eventually, through sheer grit and perseverance, Qin won admission to the famed Shanghai Institute of Foreign Languages and graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English and English Literature. With the help of family, friends, and a powerful U.S. Senator, Qin was granted a visa to study abroad. She arrived in America with two suitcases and not much more. After winning several scholarships, she graduated with a master\u2019s degree and a profound love for her new adoptive country.  <\/p>\n<p>For the past 15 years, Qin has been a newspaper columnist and writes poems, essays, short stories, and original Chinese tall tales inspired by traditional Asian themes. Her writing is inflected with both Eastern and Western flavors in ways that transcend geography to touch hearts and reveal universal truths.
