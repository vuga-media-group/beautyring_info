Najar provided a harrowing account of the grisly murder and investigation into the death of Tomas De La Riva, whose relationship with a woman turned deadly. Najar is a former Riverside County sheriff&#8217;s deputy who was a part of the investigation, and recalled how De La Riva was targeted in an execution-style murder in 2003 stemming from an elaborate plan his girlfriend and her lover were accused of hatching.<\/p>\n<p>The air date of the episode of \u201cGreen Eyed Killers\u201d featuring Najar Investigations has yet to be released.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cViolent crimes that lead to death or serious injury are often a result of a volatile relationship or extramarital affairs. Unfortunately, Mr. De La Riva became a victim of this common situation, and ultimately it cost him his life,\u201d said Najar. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis case was a sad and tragic story about an innocent man who died at the hands of someone he trusted. We took the investigation seriously from day one with the intention of getting justice for Mr. De La Riva, and hopefully some closure for his family.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Historically, crime statistics have indicated the victims of murder had a previous relationship to their killer. Women are more likely than men to be victims of intimate-partner violence that results in their death. In 2021, 34% of female murder victims were killed by their intimate partners. Men accounted for about 6% of those murder victims, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In California, an average of 124 women were the victims of murder by their intimate partners. In addition, about 45% of those victims were in the process of separating from their partner, according to non-profit organization Shelter From The Storm. <\/p>\n<p>Najar Investigations provides an array of private-investigative services for its clients, including but not limited to: infidelity, background investigations, fraud claims, missing persons, asset tracing and more. The services offered by Najar Investigations could be of tremendous value to prospective clients who are experiencing a tumultuous relationship and harbor concerns about their personal safety.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHopefully, viewers who watch the episode become enlightened by the details of the murder case involving Mr. De La Riva and consider taking precautionary measures if their relationship has become volatile \u2013 and they suspect it could lead to violence,\u201d said Najar.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about Najar Investigations, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.najarinvestigations.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.NajarInvestigations.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">WriteAgency.net<br \/>WriteAgency.net<br \/>+1 951-370-7900<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/718295023\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=m7SeNwy5VHSzNaIb&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      June 14, 2024, 10:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/718295023\/najar-investigations-featured-in-upcoming-episode-of-a-e-networks-documentary-series-green-eyed-killers\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
