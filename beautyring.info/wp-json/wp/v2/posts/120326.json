Parenting requires time and effort to ensure that children grow up in an environment of love and care, where they are given the amount of independence they require as well as the proper care that every child deserves. Despite the fact that their parents love and care for their children unconditionally, some children go through life without these advantages, and some are even neglected to the point where they develop psychological traumas that scar them for the rest of their lives.<\/p>\n<p>In his book, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Help-Hurting-Child-Approaches-Therapeutic\/dp\/1990695558\/ref=monarch_sidesheet\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Help for the Hurting Child: Christian Approaches to Therapeutic Parenting<\/a>, Larry E.
