Canister vacuums generally have more suction power than upright models. This power makes them particularly well suited for cleaning bare floors. Canister vacuums tend to be slightly lighter than upright models. On the other hand, the upright segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 6.8% from 2023 to 2032, owing to its versatile usage, adjustable features, and innovative motor. They can be used as vacuum cleaners for hardwood floors and carpets.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The electric segment to maintain its lion\u2019s share throughout the forecast period:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Based on mode of operation, the electric segment held the highest market share in 2022, contributing to around four-fifths of the global industrial vacuum cleaner market, and is estimated to maintain its lion\u2019s share throughout the forecast period. Electric vacuum cleaners have a higher capacity for collecting dust as compared to pneumatic ones. In addition, the canister doesn\u2019t need to be emptied frequently. This is the reason why electric vacuum cleaners are an ideal appliance for people who suffer from allergies. However, the pneumatic segment would display the fastest CAGR of 6.2% during the forecast period. Pneumatic vacuum systems have several advantages when compared to conventional vacuum systems. Since they are powered by compressed air, pneumatic vacuums do not have any moving parts. Pneumatic vacuum systems are a great option for hazardous materials, including combustible materials.<\/p>\n<p>The food and beverages segment to maintain its lead position during the forecast period:<\/p>\n<p>Based on end-user industry, the food and beverages segment accounted for the largest share in 2022, contributed more than two-fifths of the global industrial vacuum cleaner market revenue, and is projected to maintain its lead position during the forecast period. owing to variou<\/p>\n<p>s factors such as the rise in disposable income of people, the availability of many food and beverage options, the rise in retail shops, and the rise in the e-commerce industry, which eventually drive demand for industrial vacuum cleaners. However, the pharmaceutical segment is expected to exhibit the fastest CAGR of 6.7% from 2023 to 2032. Due to the increase in the geriatric population, awareness regarding healthy lifestyles, the onset of new diseases, and various government initiatives across the world that focus on developing their own medical infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Asia-Pacific region to maintain its dominance by 2032:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Based on region, Asia-Pacific held the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2022, accounting for more than half of the global industrial vacuum cleaner market revenue, and is likely to dominate the market during the forecast period. Simultaneously, the same region is expected to witness the fastest CAGR of 6.5% from 2023 to 2032. The expansion of the industrial vacuum cleaner market in Asia-Pacific is attributable to rapid economic growth and population growth in countries such as China, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia, which eventually is expected to drive growth in the industrial sector. <\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Enquire Before Buying: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=8cuAGtN18TsPCK47SL1BEIuJamkQOFtLYblaQlk0P_iVGC56a3NnMpIhl8KDAnzgraUqv88Qv3jsZGh9a_cOwmy038D6P7UXjR4vAGb2gDNAKkj8a0LSQgyGy-OoQ8ujCLfLiQYd7D5Yxu-_JZMH6cYXYJQ3tSWxo16R2jMk12NMzch55FgXWTcUsorU-UAF\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/purchase-enquiry\/75118<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Leading Market Players:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 ACPL GROUP<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Alfred K\u00e4rcher GmbH &amp; Co.
