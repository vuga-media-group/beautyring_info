This democratization of comfort and functionality is reshaping the market landscape.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Shameel Abdulla, Chief Executive Officer, Clootrack.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>CLAYMONT, DELAWARE, UNITED STATES, July 19, 2023\/<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/\" dir=\"auto\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">EINPresswire.com<\/a>\/ &#8212; The sportswear industry has been at the forefront of customer experience innovation, with a strong focus on personalization, technology integration, and immersive brand experiences. A Clootrack report has highlighted the top insights into customer behavior, segmenting the audience by gender and upper<br \/>\nwear vs. bottom wear based on 32K customer reviews of 22 leading sportswear brands.<\/p>\n<p>The report identifies the top five category drivers in the sportswear industry, with Size and Fit, Material, and Fabric, and Looks and Style emerging as the most significant factors. Quality also plays a pivotal role in ensuring customer satisfaction, while Color stands out as a key driver for upper wear.<\/p>\n<p>The Comfort Renaissance: How Affordable Clothes are Making Comfort a Priority<\/p>\n<p>The sportswear industry has witnessed a notable trend in customer reviews, with a staggering 60% increase in reviews for sportswear priced under $50. Additionally, the number of stock keeping units (SKUs) in this price range has seen a significant rise of 86% in 2022. This indicates a growing demand for affordable sportswear options among consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Comfort has quickly become one of the top priorities for consumers, regardless of the price point. Quality is another essential aspect that customers are increasingly focusing on when it comes to affordable clothing.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, it was commonly assumed that lower prices automatically equated to compromised quality. However, as the market for affordable fashion expands, brands are actively challenging this perception. Consumers are pleasantly surprised to discover that many budget-friendly options offer impressive durability, attention to detail, and effective construction.<\/p>\n<p>Freedom to Move: Exploring the Significance of Comfort in Bottom Wear<\/p>\n<p>Further analysis into upper wear and bottom wear drivers reveals that the top three drivers remain consistent across both segments. However, Comfort takes a higher priority for bottom wear as athletes and sports enthusiasts prioritize freedom of movement.<\/p>\n<p>But why does comfort matter so much when it comes to athletes&amp;#39; bottom wear choices?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSports and intense physical activities require a wide range of motions, quick movements, and flexibility. Whether it&amp;#39;s shorts, leggings, or track pants, athletes require garments that provide them with the utmost comfort and freedom of movement, which is why comfort is a top priority for them.<\/p>\n<p>The Battle of Priorities: Quality vs. Comfort in the Sportswear Market, Discovered by Gender Analysis<\/p>\n<p>The gender-based analysis shows that male customers take the spotlight when it comes to reviewing sportswear, indicating their higher presence and engagement in the market. Quality is paramount for male customers, who value durability, performance, and longevity. On the other hand, female customers prioritize comfort, seeking sportswear that provides ease of movement, breathability, and flexibility. <\/p>\n<p>Understanding these distinctions helps brands cater to the specific needs and preferences of their target<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\naudience.<\/p>\n<p>A fascinating insight emerging from the gender-based analysis is the importance of<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\npockets to male customers. Pockets serve as a functional and practical feature, allowing<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nthem to conveniently carry essentials like phones, keys, or wallets while staying active.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThis revelation highlights the significance of incorporating functional design elements<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nthat cater to the specific needs of male customers within the sportswear market.<\/p>\n<p>Sportswear Industry Shifts Gears: Adapting to Customers&amp;#39; Changing Needs<\/p>\n<p>It is evident that the sportswear industry is evolving to meet customers&amp;#39; changing needs<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nand expectations. Whether it is ensuring the right fit and comfort, incorporating<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nsustainable practices, or providing a seamless purchase experience, sportswear brands<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nhave the opportunity to enhance customer satisfaction and capture a larger market<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nshare.<\/p>\n<p>For more detailed insights and analysis, please refer to the full report,<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nvisit: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.clootrack.com\/insights\/retail\/customer-experience-insights-sportswear-\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.clootrack.com\/insights\/retail\/customer-experience-insights-sportswear-<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nindustry<\/p>\n<p>These insights were the topics of a discussion in the<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_qaJvuBmczM\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_qaJvuBmczM<\/a> hosted by Dan Gingiss, an<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\ninternational CX keynote speaker.<\/p>\n<p>About CLOOTRACK: Clootrack is an intelligent customer experience analytics platform<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nthat helps brands understand why customer experience drops.<\/p>\n<p>For more information, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.clootrack.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.clootrack.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Media Contact: pr@clootrack.com<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Channasandra Madhumanjunatha<br \/>Clootrack Software Labs Private Limited<br \/>+1 9495183646<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/645216422\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/clootrack\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/clootrack\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/clootrack\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCg8_JzqzhhXIxdEUOB4DQJA\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">CX Winning Formula: Insights from the Sportswear Industry<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"_qaJvuBmczM\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"EP 09 | CX Winning Formula: Insights from the Sportswear Industry\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/_qaJvuBmczM?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=rRxySG8-s2bXKHAm&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      July 19, 2023, 15:02 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/645216422\/a-cry-for-quality-a-call-for-comfort-unraveling-the-gender-based-sportswear-customer-needs\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
