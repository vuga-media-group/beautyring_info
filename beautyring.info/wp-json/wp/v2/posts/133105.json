This episode offers listeners an insider&#8217;s look into Kim Cross&#8217; gripping book, which recently gained national attention after being covered in the 20\/20 episode &#8220;Taken at Night.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In Light of All Darkness delves into the haunting story of the Polly Klaas case, a case that still resonates in the collective memory even after 30 years. The book unravels the chilling tale of a 12-year-old girl who was kidnapped at knife point during a sleepover with her two friends. Kim Cross began working on this book in 2016 and reignited the process after meeting her friend, Meg, who has now become her research director.  <\/p>\n<p>With Cross\u2019 relationship with law enforcement, detectives, and FBI agents, this book is filled with emotion. Cross shares, \u201cThe law enforcement men, who have seen horrific crimes, wept during their interviews because this case was extremely personal to them. Their reaction moved me, which is why I had to include the emotion in my book.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ghost and Garnets Host Whitney Rivera shares, \u201cThe moment for me in the book where I realized how different this was because you had all of this input from the investigators was when they were at the crime scene and Vail Bello thought in his head, \u2018I\u2019m just going to kill him.\u2019 You would never know that. That is something no one has heard before.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Adding to this, Rivera says, \u201cThis bonus episode was a perfect treat for our listeners as we delved into exclusive, never-before-heard content right after our road trip episode to California.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Each month, Ghosts and Garnets does a road trip episode to a new state. This month, in anticipation of the interview, Ghosts and Garnets traveled to California to discuss the Polly Klaas case, providing valuable context for Kim Cross&#8217; upcoming appearance. <\/p>\n<p>Co-host Camden Schacher adds, &#8220;We are honored to have Kim Cross join us on Ghosts and Garnets. Her book is a testament to her dedication and meticulous research \u2014 it is truly next level. Our listeners are in for a compelling and thought-provoking discussion.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Ghosts and Garnets actively seeks opportunities to be involved in the community, whether it&#8217;s attending local events, supporting a non-profit organization, or interviewing a local author like Kim Cross.
