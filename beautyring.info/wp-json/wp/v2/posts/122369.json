margin-bottom:8pt;\">Moreover, due to the worldwide economic crisis and supply chain disruption brought on by the pandemic, the automotive flywheel industry experienced a number of difficulties. There was a significant drop in consumer demand for new cars because of the lockdowns and travel restrictions implemented by many nations to stop the virus&#8217;s spread. As a result, many automakers folded in order to halt or scale back production, which decreased demand for flywheels.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0in; margin-bottom:8pt;\">In addition, the pandemic compelled a lot of automakers to halt or reduce their manufacturing lines, which decreased demand for vehicle parts including flywheels. Many flywheel manufacturers experienced a reduction in sales as a result, which compelled some of them to review their business models and explore new markets or product lines.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Procure Complete Research Report Now <\/strong>&#8211; <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=wbJyuOrwjzw1aSJPUSm7q1UX_sk8KXbes6_qZ_LsjeveNLZDw8kfP2h928jgqFX9QnHe43Za3bGAPsfZ9IxWyPc2iW4Dt4HR_esrfhGF2Om9JCe_8NNDTPEsXpXHmYOxa3DFuN5SS8nTiW0on05uWUCyfBSBOq4L3V3m_yhZarKLmgyRlf6dvplSNZqlPpbBpcR-aJJJEeABjlh9eUhHyqkS0UFv2DHMmAMynEJNsc3jGRlmKakFzImcDMTKkhnM\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/automotive-flywheel-market\/purchase-options<\/u><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>The single mass segment to maintain its lead position during the forecast period.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Based on type, the single mass segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for more than three-fifths of the global automotive market, and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period. e This is due to the fact that a single-mass flywheels are less expensive to purchase and enable faster engine revving, they are appropriate for situations where there are frequent changes in engine speed and gear. This leads to the growth of the segment in the global market. However, the dual mass segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 4.2% from 2023 to 2032.\u00a0This is because dual-mass flywheels increase fuel efficiency.\u00a0Hence, they widely utilized in commercial vehicles, notably those with diesel engines and manual transmissions. An increase in the penetration of commercial vehicles is anticipated to drive the growth of the dual-mass flywheel market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The manual transmission segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By transmission type, the manual transmission segment accounted for the largest share in 2022, contributing to nearly half of the global automotive flywheel market revenue. Manual transmissions are generally less expensive than automatic transmissions, making them a more affordable option for budget-conscious consumers. Manual transmissions typically have better fuel efficiency than automatic transmissions, as they allow for more precise control over the engine\u2019s power output. However, the continuously variable transmission segment is expected to portray the largest CAGR of 4.4% from 2023 to 2032. The increasing adoption of hybrid vehicles, which often use CVT transmission due to their ability to provide smooth and effective action power transfer. The growth in these alternative powertrain vehicles has led to increasing demand for CVT transmissions, thereby boosting the flywheel market in the continuously variable transmission segment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Asia-Pacific to maintain its dominance by 2032.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Based on region, Asia-Pacific held the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2022, accounting for more than two-fifths of the global automotive flywheel market revenue, and is expected to witness the fastest CAGR of 4.3% from 2022 to 2032. The growth of the regional market is mainly attributed to the growth in the automotive industry and retail sectors.
