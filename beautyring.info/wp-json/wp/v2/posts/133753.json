The 3-day event showcases first-time filmmakers and experienced professionals who make films about addiction, treatment, recovery and mental health issues. Slated for screening is an eclectic lineup of new features, documentaries and shorts from American and international filmmakers.<\/p>\n<p>After each film, the filmmaker will perform a question-and-answer session or a clinician will do a mini-interactive process group with audience members. There will be engagement with the audience to welcome their comments, reviews, feelings and observations. These discussions will offer information on addiction as experienced by communities and families.  <\/p>\n<p>The REEL Film Festival &amp; Symposium, in its 15th year, is scheduled for Friday, October 27, Saturday, October 28 and Sunday, October 29 at the Laemmle NoHo Cinema in North Hollywood from 5 until 11 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>Opening night will feature two local filmmakers, Aimee Graham and Cal Barnes, with &#8220;The Allnighter\u201d and \u201cThe Astrid Experience.&#8221; On Saturday, the festival will highlight &#8220;Bay St. Healer,\u201d wherein a well-known psychiatrist decries overprescribing psychiatric medication. The festival will conclude on Sunday with \u201cOur American Family,\u201d often compared to the iconic PBS series \u201cAn American Family.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Also scheduled for a screening is the Israeli film \u201cStuck,\u201d which tells the story of Hatzil, a young army veteran with PTSD, and his two friends, Elad and Yachta, travel to the Golan heights and find themself stuck in a minefield. Veterans can see this film free of charge.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAddiction is a human condition that affects many in a variety of ways. While these films may be difficult to watch, they can provoke empathy and sometimes act as a cautionary tale. They can help us understand ourselves or a loved one in a very powerful way.\u201d said Leonard Lee Buschel, co-founder of Writers In Treatment and Creator of The REEL Film Festival &amp; Symposium. <\/p>\n<p>Mr. Buschel also expressed gratitude for the supporter of this year\u2019s festival presenting sponsor The Guest House, Ocala. <\/p>\n<p>In addition to films, there will also be a Narcan training session at the festival.
