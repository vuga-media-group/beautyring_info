Diagnosed with a brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in August 2006, Segal underwent a grueling 13-hour surgery and spent 33 days in the hospital. His recovery journey began in January 2007, starting from a place where he couldn&#8217;t walk, talk, or read.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI had to re-learn how to walk, speak, and read all over again,\u201d Segal shared. \u201cI decided to incorporate a musical instrument into my therapy and chose the bass. Reading music helped me re-learn reading and playing improved my hand-eye coordination.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although Segal had previously dabbled in guitar and bass, he had never formally pursued either instrument. His determination to overcome the devastating effects of his AVM through music therapy transformed him into a jazz bassist.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDuring my rehabilitation, I realized I wanted to give back to those who supported me with their love, care, and prayers,\u201d Segal said. \u201cI founded The Jazz Sanctuary to provide free music to charitable organizations and houses of worship.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Established in 2011, The Jazz Sanctuary is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that offers jazz performances free of charge to charitable organizations, senior centers, hospitals, rehab centers, community centers, and houses of worship throughout Philadelphia and the neighboring Pennsylvania and New Jersey suburbs. <\/p>\n<p>With over 800 performances to date, The Jazz Sanctuary continues to enrich the community through music.<\/p>\n<p>This June, The Jazz Sanctuary kicks off its summer season with four exciting concerts:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tThursday, June 13 at Trinity Episcopal Church (Routes 202 &amp; 413, Buckingham, PA 18912). The &#8220;Jazz &amp; Joe&#8221; concert, featuring live music, coffee, and treats, starts at 7 p.m. and features The Jazz Sanctuary Quintet: James Dell\u2019Orefice (piano), Grant MacAvoy (drums), Randy Sutin (vibes\/percussion), Eddie Etkins (tenor saxophone), and Alan Segal (bass).<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tSunday, June 23 at Saint Miriam Parish and Friary (654 Bethlehem Pike, Flourtown, PA 19031). The debut performance at this venue begins at 3 p.m. and features The Jazz Sanctuary Quintet: James Dell\u2019Orefice (piano), Leon Jordan Sr. (drums), Randy Sutin (vibes\/percussion), Eddie Etkins (tenor saxophone), and Alan Segal (bass).<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tWednesday, June 26 at St. Peter\u2019s Episcopal Church (South 4th Street &amp; Pine Street, Philadelphia, PA 19106). Part of St. Peter\u2019s annual outdoor concert in the churchyard series, the performance by The Jazz Sanctuary Quintet begins at 6:30 p.m., featuring: James Dell\u2019Orefice (piano), Leon Jordan Sr. (drums), Randy Sutin (vibes\/percussion), Eddie Etkins (tenor saxophone), and Alan Segal (bass).<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tThursday, June 27 at Gloria Dei (Old Swedes\u2019) Episcopal Church (8 Christian St., Philadelphia, PA 19147). The &#8220;Jazz &amp; Joe&#8221; concert starts at 7:30 p.m., featuring The Jazz Sanctuary Quintet: James Dell\u2019Orefice (piano), Leon Jordan Sr. (drums), Randy Sutin (vibes\/percussion), Eddie Etkins (tenor saxophone), and Alan Segal (bass).<\/p>\n<p>The Jazz Sanctuary\u2019s mission is to maintain and share America&#8217;s great music invention, jazz, by performing at community gatherings, supporting other charitable organizations, and providing educational development through their Sanctuary Jam program. They also ensure fair compensation for their musicians.<\/p>\n<p>To support their mission, The Jazz Sanctuary continues to seek additional funding and corporate sponsorships. In their most recent donation match period from December 2023 to January 2024, they raised over $11,000. Additionally, they received a $2,500 grant from The Presser Foundation.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about The Jazz Sanctuary and their upcoming events, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/thejazzsanctuary.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/thejazzsanctuary.com<\/a>.<br \/>&#13;\n<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Jim DeLorenzo<br \/>Jim DeLorenzo Public Relations<br \/>+ +1 (215) 266-5943<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/715330309\/mailto:jim@jhdenterprises.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">jim@jhdenterprises.com<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jim.delorenzo1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jhd16\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">X<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/jimdelorenzo\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jimdelorenzo\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/jhd16\/videos?app=desktop\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Alan Segal reveals the secret origin of The Jazz Sanctuary in a recent interview.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"b22WHK-LTbs\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Message in the Music W\/ Alan Segal - Jim DeLorenzo&#039;s Storytelling with a Purpose\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/b22WHK-LTbs?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=qxFgCwQLc2_6Qtaj&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      May 29, 2024, 14:30 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/715330309\/reflecting-on-an-origin-story-that-begins-with-brain-surgery-the-jazz-sanctuary-continues-vision-of-founder-alan-segal\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
