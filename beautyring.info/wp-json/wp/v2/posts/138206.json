The global K-beauty products market size was valued at $10.2 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $13.9 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 9.0% from 2021 to 2027.<\/p>\n<p>Sample Copy of Report: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/request-sample\/6149\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/request-sample\/6149<\/a><\/p>\n<p>K-beauty products refer to the skincare and makeup products originated from South Korea. These beauty products emphasize particularly on skin aesthetics such as health, hydration, and luminous textured skin. Korean women have traditionally favored glowing \u2018glass\u2019 skin over layers of foundation and lengthy skin care regimes with focus on toning and clarifying. Their beauty standards focus on the appearance of moisture on the skin, resulting in an augmented fondness for cremes over powders. Products in this segment are manufactured using unique ingredients such as snail slime, bee venom, starfish extract, pig collagen, and morphing masks.<\/p>\n<p>Global per capita income has witnessed a strong growth rate over past few years, particularly in emerging economies. Increase in urbanization, growth of middle class consumers, and surge in rate of female participation in labor force in many developing and developed markets has encouraged adoption of convenience-oriented lifestyles, making K-Beauty products more desirable. In addition, as consumers become more meticulous regarding their lifestyle choices, they are looking deeper than superficial solutions and choosing more traditional healthy approaches of beauty. Hence, the rise in demand for natural and organically derived ingredients in cosmetic and personal care products, has created new avenues in the K-beauty cosmeceutical market.<\/p>\n<p>Based on product type, the sheet mask segment accounted for the highest market share in 2019, holding more than one-fifths of the global K-beauty Products market, and will continue its lead position during the forecast period. This is attributed to its ease of application and convenience. However, the cleanser segment is expected to register the highest CAGR of 11.0% from 2021 to 2027. The fact that Korean cleansers are manufactured using naturally derived ingredients such as green tea leaves, olive oil, and essential oils which maintain the skin pH balance and hence are highly moisture retentive drive the growth of the segment.<\/p>\n<p>Complete Report: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/checkout-final\/514a87c7d4640642d66c2a8ba051208a\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/checkout-final\/514a87c7d4640642d66c2a8ba051208a<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Based on end user, the female segment contributed to the highest share in terms of revenue in 2019, accounting for more than two-thirds of the global K-beauty Products market, and is projected to maintain its dominance in terms of revenue during the forecast period. This is attributed to the trend of  skin care and makeup product manufactured with ingredients capable to address their specific issues. However, the male segment is projected to portray the highest CAGR of 9.9% from 2021 to 2027. <\/p>\n<p>Based on region, Asia-Pacific, followed by North America, held the largest market share in 2019, contributing to more than two-thirds of the global K-beauty Products market, and will maintain its leadership status by 2027. Consumers in this region are more focused on products that cater to skincare regimes. In addition, consumers increasingly demand beauty products manufactured using natural and organic ingredients instead of synthetic. These factors drive the growth of the market in this province. However, Europe is expected to grow at the highest CAGR of 12.0% during the forecast period. <\/p>\n<p>Key Benefits For Stakeholders<\/p>\n<p>\u25cb This report provides a quantitative analysis of the
