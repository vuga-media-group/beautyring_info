The platform \u201chelps connect patients, doctors, and lab and radiology centers for a more seamless medical experience\u201d and timely scheduling. At the same time, LabFinder provides \u201cone central repository for users\u2019 testing results. Results are stored and shared in one convenient portal [and are often available in 24-48 hours], allowing patients to be more empowered with their health and medical decisions,\u201d according to an Internet description of the system. <\/p>\n<p>Digital platforms like LabFinder offer clinicians readily available information to which they can refer before writing patient orders for medical tests. Allowing clinicians to indicate whether proposed tests are duplicative for a patient or offer results similar to what has already been obtained through prior testing, Dr. Segal says. \u201cThese electronic exchanges also give patients pricing information, allowing them to shop around for the most cost-effective testing services at high-quality laboratories and radiology centers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In a 2019 report from the Health Care Cost Institute (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/bitly.ws\/\/BI5b\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http:\/\/bitly.ws\/\/BI5b<\/a>), investigators found that the same testing services \u2013 sometimes in the same or similar metro regions \u2013 can vary by as much as 25-39 times.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Segal is certainly not alone in his concerns about testing charges. As reported in Forbes (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/bitly.ws\/BHXS\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http:\/\/bitly.ws\/BHXS<\/a>) magazine, results of a national poll published in 2018 by the West Health Institute\/NORC at the University of Chicago determined that 40 percent of Americans either skipped a treatment or avoided a medical test because of cost.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, such depressing numbers have not changed much in more recent years,\u201d Dr. Segal says. According to healthsystemtracker.org, National Health Interview Survey data collected through 2021 shows four in 10 adults reporting either they or a household family member delayed medical testing or care due to cost.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, delays in providing patients with timely access to health care is not simply a matter of dollars and cents, Dr. Segal states. He cites a 2018 study in the journal Diagnosis (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/bitly.ws\/BI5Z\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http:\/\/bitly.ws\/BI5Z<\/a>) in which authors write: \u201cInappropriate use of laboratory resources, due to excessive number of tests not really necessary for patient care or by failure to order the appropriate diagnostic test, may lead to wrong, missed or delayed diagnosis, thus potentially jeopardizing patient safety. It is estimated that five percent to 95 percent of tests are currently used inappropriately, depending on the appropriateness criteria, thus significantly contributing to the potential of generating medical errors, the third leading cause of death in the United States.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The author of an Institute of Medicine commentary (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/bitly.ws\/B12e\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http:\/\/bitly.ws\/B12e<\/a>) on the physician-sponsored choosingwisely.org website states that doctors\u2019 \u201cethical and professional responsibility\u201d is to ensure \u201cpatients [receive] only the care that is needed and provides benefits.  But often physicians say they have difficulty saying \u2018no\u2019 to patients\u2019 requests for tests and treatments.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPatients make these requests because they are uninformed and feel left out of decisions involving their care. Ongoing development of secure, digital platforms like LabFinder, which provide patients ready access to their clinical information, will help make patients feel more involved in the recommendations and advice of their clinicians,\u201d Dr. Segal indicates.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cInformation technology (IT) platforms are highly functional, flexible, and secure and offer limitless data storage for physicians and patients alike,\u201d Dr. Segal adds. \u201cThese technologies also encourage networking, information sharing, communication, and use of increasingly innovative apps \u2013 all of which can help cut patients\u2019 medical costs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For patients struggling with costs of diagnostic testing, Dr. Segal offers this advice:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tCarefully consider the site where testing is done. Is a physician\u2019s recommendation for an in-office ultrasound exam less expensive than one performed at a nearby, high-volume center? Changing testing locations can sometimes result in significant savings. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tIf your physician orders a test, question it. Determine its purpose and the type of data that the test will provide. Is it vital information or simply something that would be \u201cnice to have?\u201d Would another, perhaps less-expensive test return similar information? Become an engaged patient.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tMake the most of your health insurance deductible. If you already have paid out your maximum for the year, squeeze in the additional needed tests before year\u2019s end so that insurance fully covers them (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/bitly.ws\/BK4w\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http:\/\/bitly.ws\/BK4w<\/a>).<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tUse \u201ceHealth\u201d platforms to find the highest quality, but least expensive testing centers. A study published in Health Affairs determined \u201cpatients are more vigilant custodians of cost than their doctors,\u201d according to a New York Times article about the study (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/bitly.ws\/BK5H\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http:\/\/bitly.ws\/BK5H<\/a>), and smarter than to believe higher prices simply mean better quality.<\/p>\n<p>Bio: Robert Segal MD, board-certified in cardiovascular disease, echocardiography, and nuclear cardiology.
