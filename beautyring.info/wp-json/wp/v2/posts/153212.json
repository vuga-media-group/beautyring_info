technical performance,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Ebrahim Nana<\/span>, President and founder of NanaWall Systems. &#8220;For almost a decade, CERO has been the architect&#8217;s choice for creating striking, light-filled environments with maximalized sightlines in both commercial and residential applications. Our new updates will solidify that position and allow CERO to be utilized in even more designs and configurations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Some of the new key features in CERO include:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Panels heights up to 15 feet \u2013 more than 15% taller than the original, with the possibility for seven or more tracks and open corner designs;<\/li>\n<li>New minimal sill that visually disappears with finished flooring inserts and provides barefoot friendly transitions;<\/li>\n<li>Rails and stiles with an ultra slim and uniform 1 5\/16&#8243; (34mm) top to bottom, side to side, yielding a symmetrical and minimalist design with beautiful sightlines and 98% glass to frame ratio;<\/li>\n<li>For commercial exterior projects, cero transforms glazed floor-to-ceiling facades into flexible openings in settings such as offices, hotels, restaurants, and auto dealerships;<\/li>\n<li>For commercial interiors and offices, CERO is a fully tested and acoustically rated minimal sliding glass wall capable of reaching sound control up to a unit STC 43;<\/li>\n<li>Breathtaking design possibilities for residential projects, allowing floor-to-ceiling openings in clerestory and double height living spaces;<\/li>\n<li>NanaWall&#8217;s technical support team \u2013 including experienced installation managers and certified installers \u2013 work with the architect and contractor every step ensuring precision installations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>NanaWall CERO offers multiple track and concealed carrier systems for smooth gliding with the minimal, flush, and performance sill options. An integrated screen is available for configurations that slide and meet the jam.
