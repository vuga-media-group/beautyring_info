Immigrating from Cameroon, where Queerness is criminalized, a young man finds his purpose through performance and eventually becomes the very first winner of iconic reality show RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. Marshall Ngwa (aka BeBe Zahara Benet) came to the US in pursuit of education and discovered his gifts in the art form of drag. Filmed over 15 years, the documentary parallels Marshall\u2019s fight to maintain the trajectory of his career alongside a deep connection with his traditional African roots and family.<\/p>\n<p>BeBe attended the screening in Los Angeles, along with director Emily Branham. Award-winning journalist Jasmyne Cannick moderated a Q&amp;A with both following the screening.<\/p>\n<p>The screening at the Pan African Film &amp; Arts Festival provided a platform for \u201cBeing BeB\u201d\u2019 to reach a diverse audience eager to engage with LGBTQ narratives. The festival\u2019s commitment to showcasing underrepresented voices and fostering dialogue around issues of race, identity, and sexuality made it the perfect venue for the documentary\u2019s premiere.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled to shine a spotlight on \u201cBeing BeBe\u201d and celebrate the incredible legacy of BeBe Zahara Benet,\u201d said Cannick, who has been a part of the festival for more than 20 years. \u201cAt the Pan African Film &amp; Arts Festival, we believe in the power of film to challenge perceptions and create meaningful change. This documentary exemplifies that ethos, and we are honored to share it with our audiences.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The screening was also supported by the Black AIDS Institute and BAJI, the Black Alliance for Just Immigration.<\/p>\n<p>About the Pan African Film &amp; Arts Festival<\/p>\n<p>The 32nd Pan African Film &amp; Arts Festival (PAFF) makes its return to Los Angeles February 6-19, 2024 at the Cinemark Baldwin Hills XD and Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza to present and showcase a broad spectrum of Black creative works, particularly those that reinforce positive images and help to destroy negative stereotypes of Africans and African-Americans.<\/p>\n<p>Since 1992, as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, PAFF has remained dedicated to the promotion of Black stories and images through the exhibition of film, visual art, and other creative expression.
