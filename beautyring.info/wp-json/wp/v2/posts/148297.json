Upon graduation, he joined Mountain Land Rehabilitation, Inc. working in a large rehabilitation facility in Provo, Utah. He became the Facility Rehab Coordinator where his responsibilities include: Supervising the daily operations for Physical, Occupational and Speech Therapy Services. Dr. Schultz joined Physical &amp; Sports Therapy Services in 1998 when the Orem Utah clinic was opened. Working with the general public, as well as athletes, in rehabilitating their orthopedic and sports related injuries has given Dr. Craig the opportunity to pursue his professional goals and interests. Dr. Craig is a member of the American Physical Therapy Association. Currently Dr. Schultz resides in Orem with his wife Tracy and their five children.<\/p>\n<p>TherapEase goal is to host a DEMO EVENT in every influential city in order to better educate and inform top tier, highly rated, professional Physical Therapy physicians in the metropolitan area regarding their groundbreaking Medical Knee Rehab, Recovery Devices: GenuEase, GenUbender and KneeEASE.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;TherapEase started in 2006 to develop a new approach to post-surgical rehabilitation for knee replacement patients. Physical Therapists (PTs) were searching for a device that would allow patients to mechanically bend their own knees so that they could be guided by their own pain and thus fully engage and be in control of their own recovery,&#8221; Dr. Craig A. Schultz, Physical Therapist, Orem Utah<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Schultz continues: &#8220;GenuEase is that device. GenuEase provides patients: (1) faster range-of-motion ROM recovery, (2) with fewer complications and (3) greater satisfaction than any other rehabilitation method. GenuEase is protected by two US patents and has been proven by thousands of patients in millions of therapy cycles.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Surgeons notice the improved recovery rates and flexibility of patients using GenuEase they become a partner of choice as prescribed rehabilitation services. Physical Therapists investment in a GenuEase can represent a real competitive advantage and opportunity for increased market share over clinics offering only traditional knee rehabilitation services.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Why It Works: Patients recover a greater range of motion (ROM) in less time for several reasons. GenuEase provides better isolation of the knee and more targeted rehabilitation than is possible with manual stretching, wall slides, or other traditional treatments. GenuEase supports a greater range of dynamic motion than any other method provides.<\/p>\n<p>However, the most important reason why GenuEase delivers faster recovery, and better results, is the complete elimination of patient apprehension and muscle guarding.<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: GenUbender is the lighter weight, made for home use, more portable version of the GenuEase<\/p>\n<p>THERAPIST TESTIMONIAL:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cI have had an overwhelming response from patients about the effectiveness of GenuEase. Patients have returned to my clinic because we are the only facility that has the GenuEase. As a physical therapist I value the GenuEase because the patient is always in control which drastically reduces muscle guarding. The GenuEase is also a great way to build patient confidence because the patient receives immediate feedback on range of motion progress.\u201d<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2014Tom Farnsworth P.T., M.P.T .<\/p>\n<p>THERAPIST TESTIMONIAL:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cI thought all my post-op. knee patients (especially total knees) needed was my hands-on mobilization for ROM. I was wrong. I have found GenuEase is a critical adjunct to my manual stretching. My patients, particularly the more difficult and guarded cases, gain greater ROM in less time using GenuEase.\u201d<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2014Darren Averett, DPT<\/p>\n<p>Case Studies:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nGenuEase is capable of -5\u00b0 to 135\u00b0 Range of Motion (ROM). A digital display provides the patient with a real time measure of their ROM as well as their progress across sessions. This critical information provides the intrinsic motivation which influences your patient\u2019s effort during each session. Recording and tracking session data allows the patient not only to set goals but also to recognize both their improvement over time and the value of services provided.<\/p>\n<p>Patients Start Recovery Sooner: Comparative case studies show achievement of greater ROM in less time than is possible with traditional therapy. GenuEase can be used as soon as the patient can sit unassisted \u2013 usually upon discharge from the hospital.<\/p>\n<p>Proposed GenuEase Demo-Event Locations for 2024:<\/p>\n<p>Abilene, TEXAS<br
