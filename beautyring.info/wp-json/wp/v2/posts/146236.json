Standard amenities include expresso coffeemakers, hairdryers, a safe, bottled water, large HD TV information centers, ceiling fans, and a fridge.<\/p>\n<p>The property features a <span>casino<\/span> with 86 new state-of-the-art slot machines, a full-service restaurant and bar with craft cocktails, a delicious new menu, and authentic music memorabilia. The Rock Shop sells custom Rocksino by Hard Rock apparel.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Tying in modern technology to an historic structure originally built in the 1890s, brings this beautiful property to a whole new level for Deadwood,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Steve Slowey<\/span>, Rocksino managing partner and CEO of Slowey Management Co., which operates a dozen other lodging properties in the region, including the iconic Bullock Hotel on Historic Main Street.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Knowing that we&#8217;re open, that we&#8217;re the Rocksino by Hard Rock Deadwood with properties all over the world, makes us proud to know what we&#8217;ll be presenting to people who visit this fabled Wild West town,&#8221; Slowey said.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Marc Oswald<\/span>, the Hard Rock brand partner in the Rocksino venture, noted that the newly revamped guest rooms feature top-of-the-line, custom-designed murals depicting musical themes with Black Hills and Badlands scenes, while the entire property sports musical accents as well as the standard Hard Rock memorabilia die-hard customers have come to expect.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-location\">Nashville&#8217;s<\/span> Oswald, and Deadwood native <span class=\"xn-person\">Trinity Conrad<\/span>, who acts as the Hard Rock brand&#8217;s property liaison, operate Deadwood Legacy Holdings. They said that bringing the Hard Rock brand to the Northern Hills community already is resulting in international exposure for the Rocksino, Deadwood and the entire Black Hills.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When combined with outdoor seating facing Deadwood&#8217;s Outlaw Square, amidst all the entertainment and 24-hour gaming action, as well as regular concerts, the Rocksino will quickly become the place to be in this remarkable town,&#8221; Oswald said. &#8220;In addition, Hard Rock International&#8217;s over 300 properties in more than 70 countries worldwide are already touting Deadwood&#8217;s new Rocksino via online efforts and on-property entertainment systems.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Each room is equipped with state-of-the art entertainment systems, which allows hotel staff team members to ask guests at check-in what genre of music they prefer, then be greeted by that style of music when they enter their room. The system also allows guests to access flight schedules for major cities, local and regional events, weather, pre-programmed radio stations, in-room yoga, and Bluetooth casting for accessing the guest&#8217;s favorite apps.<\/p>\n<p>To explore the Rocksino&#8217;s new guest rooms online, or to book a reservation, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4113661-1&amp;h=2506192945&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Frocksino.hardrock.com%2Fdeadwood%2Fhotel&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Frocksino.hardrock.com%2Fdeadwood%2Fhotel\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/rocksino.hardrock.com\/deadwood\/hotel<\/a>.
