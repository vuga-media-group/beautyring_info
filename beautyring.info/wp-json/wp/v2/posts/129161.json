He wanted to bring the incredible cuisine and <span class=\"xn-location\">New Orleans<\/span> vibe to <span class=\"xn-location\">Warren<\/span>. Tap &amp; Bitters was heavily influenced by Hasid&#8217;s beloved Cajun-Creole restaurant in <span class=\"xn-location\">Manhattan<\/span>, 1803.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled to bring <span class=\"xn-location\">New Orleans&#8217;<\/span> one-of-a-kind spirit to <span class=\"xn-location\">Warren<\/span> through Tap &amp; Bitters&#8217; refreshed dishes, cocktails and atmosphere,&#8221; said Rafi Hasid, restaurateur. &#8220;I have no doubt locals and visitors alike will enjoy the Southern-inspired curated menu and will feel as though they&#8217;ve been immersed in the city I love.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The new menu features items influenced by <span class=\"xn-location\">New Orleans&#8217;<\/span> culture, dining and drinking scene. Guests will be transported to NOLA as they enjoy a variety of dishes, such as Cajun broiled oysters, Louisiana Cajun chicken wings, signature gumbo and more. The menu will be updated seasonally, with a focus on incorporating fresh ingredients and sourcing local produce and products wherever possible. The beverage menu will be expanded to further infuse <span class=\"xn-location\">New Orleans&#8217;<\/span> famed cocktail culture, utilizing a variety of different bitters, fresh herbs and more. There are staples from the former restaurant that will remain on the new menu, including the expansive tap line with local craft beers and the local favorite &#8220;Tap&#8221; Burger.<\/p>\n<p>Additions to the d\u00e9cor and interior of the restaurant include more communal seating areas, cozy benches and low set tables, fresh greenery and plants, antique brass jazz instruments hung throughout and changes to the music to ensure guests feel immersed from the moment they walk through the door. There will soon be a variety of unique events and programming taking place at the restaurant, as well as regular live music.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited to see Rafi&#8217;s vision come to life,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Scott McArthur<\/span>, general manager of the Somerset Hills Hotel. &#8220;The restaurant is a fantastic complement to the hotel and an incredible culinary experience for our guests visiting from near and far.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tap &amp; Bitters originally opened in 2003 and quickly established itself as the local watering hole and go-to eatery for <span class=\"xn-location\">Warren<\/span> locals and visitors.
