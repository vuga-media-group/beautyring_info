The vast majority of the restricted cash is comprised of lender and manager-held reserves.

The loan was paid down by <span class=\"xn-money\">$142 million<\/span> and has a current balance of <span class=\"xn-money\">$293.2 million<\/span>.<\/li>\n<li>Subsequent to quarter end, the Company entered into a new <span class=\"xn-money\">$200 million<\/span> corporate financing that includes a <span class=\"xn-money\">$150 million<\/span> term loan and a <span class=\"xn-money\">$50 million<\/span> credit facility.<\/li>\n<li>Subsequent to quarter end, the Company announced the planned conversion of its Mr.\u00a0C Beverly Hills Hotel to Hilton&#8217;s LXR brand under the new name, Cameo Beverly Hills.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>MR. C BRAND CONVERSION<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Subsequent to quarter end, the Company announced the\u00a0rebranding and planned conversion of its Mr. C <span class=\"xn-location\">Beverly Hills<\/span> (&#8220;Mr. C&#8221;) in <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles, California<\/span> to the Cameo Beverly Hills. Beginning <span class=\"xn-chron\">August 4, 2023<\/span>, Cameo Beverly Hills will be available for booking on Hilton&#8217;s website at\u00a0hilton.com and join Hilton Honors, Hilton&#8217;s award-winning guest loyalty program. Following an extensive renovation, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2025, the hotel will join LXR Hotels &amp; Resorts (&#8220;LXR&#8221;). One of Hilton&#8217;s iconic luxury brands, LXR is a collection of unique, independent luxury properties around the world that focuses on individualized service and one-of-a-kind stays.<\/p>\n<p>The conversion of the hotel, which was built in 1965, will reflect its unique history and distinctive location in the heart of <span class=\"xn-location\">West Los Angeles<\/span> near iconic amenities and high-end shopping on Rodeo Drive. The Company is planning an approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$25 million<\/span> renovation to further elevate this distinctive hotel that will enable a revitalized luxury guest experience when it is completed. Added amenities and enhanced design elements will include upgrades to the guestrooms, guest bathrooms, restaurant, lobby, pool, fitness area, and meeting spaces. Remington will continue to manage the property after the conversion under a management agreement.<\/p>\n<p><b>CAPITAL STRUCTURE<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span>As of <span class=\"xn-chron\">June 30, 2023<\/span>, the Company had total assets of <span class=\"xn-money\">$2.3 billion<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-money\">$1.1 billion<\/span> of loans of which <span class=\"xn-money\">$49 million<\/span> related to its joint venture partner&#8217;s share of the mortgage loan on the Capital Hilton and Hilton La\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"xn-person\">Jolla Torrey<\/span><span> Pines. The Company&#8217;s total combined loans had a blended average interest rate of 7.0%, taking into account in-the-money interest rate caps. Based on the current level of <\/span>LIBOR<span> and <\/span>SOFR<span>, and the Company&#8217;s corresponding interest rate caps, approximately 79% of the Company&#8217;s consolidated debt is effectively fixed and approximately 21% is effectively floating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>During the quarter, the Company finalized an extension of its <span class=\"xn-money\">$435 million<\/span> mortgage loan secured by four properties: The Notary Hotel, The Clancy, Sofitel Chicago Magnificent Mile, and Marriott Seattle Waterfront. The loan was extended until <span class=\"xn-chron\">June 2024<\/span>. In conjunction with the extension, the Company paid down <span class=\"xn-money\">$142 million<\/span> of the loan utilizing corporate cash on hand, which reduced the loan balance to approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$293 million<\/span>. As part of the extension the Company also purchased an interest rate cap through <span class=\"xn-chron\">June 2024<\/span> with a strike rate of 4.69%.<\/p>\n<p>Subsequent to quarter end, the Company completed a <span class=\"xn-money\">$200 million<\/span> corporate financing. The financing includes a <span class=\"xn-money\">$150 million<\/span> term loan and <span class=\"xn-money\">$50 million<\/span> credit facility. The corporate financing is secured by The Ritz-Carlton Sarasota, Hotel\u00a0Yountville, and Bardessono Hotel and Spa.<\/p>\n<p><b>DIVIDENDS<\/b><\/p>\n<p>On <span class=\"xn-chron\">July 11, 2023<\/span>, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of <span class=\"xn-money\">$0.05<\/span> per diluted share for the Company&#8217;s common stock for the third quarter ending <span class=\"xn-chron\">September 30, 2023<\/span>. The dividend, which equates to an annual rate of <span class=\"xn-money\">$0.20<\/span> per share, will be paid on <span class=\"xn-chron\">October 16, 2023<\/span>, to stockholders of record as of <span class=\"xn-chron\">September 29, 2023<\/span>. The Board of Directors will review its dividend policy on a quarter-to-quarter basis, with a view to increasing it as financial performance continues to improve. The adoption of a dividend policy does not commit the Board of Directors to declare future dividends or the amount thereof.<\/p>\n<p><b>HOTEL EBITDA MARGINS AND QUARTERLY SEASONALITY TRENDS<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Company believes year-over-year Comparable Hotel EBITDA and Comparable Hotel EBITDA Margin comparisons are more meaningful to gauge the performance of the Company&#8217;s hotels than sequential quarter-over-quarter comparisons. To help investors better understand the substantial seasonality in the Company&#8217;s portfolio, the Company provides quarterly detail on its Comparable Hotel EBITDA and Comparable Hotel EBITDA Margin for the current and certain prior-year periods based upon the number of hotels in the Company&#8217;s portfolio as of the end of the current period. As the Company&#8217;s portfolio mix changes from time to time, so will the seasonality for Comparable Hotel EBITDA and Comparable Hotel EBITDA Margin.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Braemar&#8217;s urban hotels delivered solid second quarter operating performance,&#8221; noted <span class=\"xn-person\">Richard J. Stockton<\/span>, Braemar&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;We remain extremely pleased with the continued momentum of these hotels which has been driven by strong corporate and group demand. Further, despite challenging year-over-year comparisons, our resorts continued to perform well with strong margins. We also continue to make solid progress addressing loan maturities and look forward to making additional announcements related to our liability management program,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t be more excited about the conversion of our Mr. C <span class=\"xn-location\">Beverly Hills<\/span> to Hilton&#8217;s LXR brand and expect the strength of Hilton&#8217;s reservation system to have a significant positive impact on the demand at that property. Looking ahead to the second half of 2023, we believe our portfolio is well-positioned for continued strong performance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>INVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL AND SIMULCAST<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Braemar will conduct a conference call on <span class=\"xn-chron\">Wednesday, August 2, 2023<\/span>, at <span class=\"xn-chron\">12:00 p.m. ET<\/span>.
