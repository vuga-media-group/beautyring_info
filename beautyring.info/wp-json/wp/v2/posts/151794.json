Through this unique lens, she began to connect attitudes toward disabled people with attitudes toward animals, and later wrote her first book, &#8220;Beasts of Burden: Animal and Disability Liberation,&#8221; which received the 2018 American Book Award. An Assistant Professor in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management at the University of California, Berkeley, Taylor&#8217;s scholarly pursuits have garnered attention from publications like Orion Magazine, The Baffler, and Psychology Today. Now, with &#8220;Disabled Ecologies,&#8221; she delves deeper, highlighting the inseparability of the disablement of nature and the disablement of people.<\/p>\n<p>Naomi Klein, author of &#8220;Doppelganger,&#8221; says, &#8220;Taylor&#8217;s is a unique and generous genius. With breath-catching insight and enveloping compassion, she shares a secret of epochal urgency: people living with injury and impairment have much to teach about how to survive, and perhaps even thrive, on an injured and impaired planet.&#8221; Charting multispecies coalitions through the Sonoran Desert and the Tucson Basin\u2019s aquifer, Taylor uncovers entanglements that reveal disability as one of the defining features of environmental devastation and resistance. These stories tell of debilitating and sometimes life-ending injuries, but they also map out alternative modes of connection, solidarity, and resistance\u2014an environmentalism of the injured. <\/p>\n<p>An invaluable addition to the literature of the Environmental Justice movement, &#8220;Disabled Ecologies&#8221; is a rallying cry to center the needs of the most vulnerable. Taylor not only offers a way forward for all of us; she presents readers with a fundamentally new understanding of disability and what it means to live with injury. Rob Nixon, author of\u00a0&#8220;Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor,&#8221; says, &#8220;Taylor has gifted us a deeply original, brilliantly written work on the entanglements between ecological harm and human disability. This book illuminates what Taylor calls &#8216;the expansive web of injury&#8217; that binds human bodies to bodies of land, water, and other beings.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A deeply personal reflection on what disability means in an era of increasing multispecies disablement, &#8220;Disabled Ecologies&#8221; transcends environmental discourse. It is a powerful call to reflect on the kinds of care, treatment, and assistance this age of disability requires.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE BOOK<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8220;Disabled Ecologies: Lessons from a Wounded Desert&#8221; is a powerful analysis and call to action that\u00a0reveals disability as one of the defining features of environmental devastation and resistance, released on May 21, 2024, by the University of California Press. <\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSunaura Taylor is an artist and writer.
