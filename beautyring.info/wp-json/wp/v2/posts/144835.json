On February 1, 2024 &#8211; The historic Yamashiro Restaurant in Hollywood hosted brilliant Filipino heritage producers, filmmakers, actresses and actors for a symbolic night of entertainment advancement. The Manila International Film Festival has a deep-rooted mission; to showcase, promote, and help uplift Filipino films from the cinemas of the Philippines onto the screens of Hollywood and beyond. Organizers of the Manila International Film Festival strive to bridge the gap between the two distinct entertainment worlds in order to passionately connect the Philippine entertainment industry with the glamor of Hollywood. The Philippine film industry hopes to bring its edge of imagination to international stages, forging a new legacy for creative minds. <\/p>\n<p>During this special event, The Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP) hosted a roundtable discussion titled \u2018Shoot Your Next Film or TV Series In The Philippines!\u2019.
