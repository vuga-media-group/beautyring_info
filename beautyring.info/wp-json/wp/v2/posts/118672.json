The platform makes it possible for spa or non-spa hotels, clubs, and premium residential properties to easily provide high quality on-demand spa services such as massages, facials, nails and lash applications.<\/p>\n<p>For 10 years, Soothe has provided on-demand spa services directly to homes across the globe by connecting its community of licensed professional providers with customers seeking wellness services whenever, wherever needed. Soothe is now extending this convenience and flexibility to hotels, spas, clubs, and residential properties, enabling them to fulfill guests&#8217; increasing demand for wellness services.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Overnight, hotels, spas, clubs, and residential properties can enhance their wellness services offering with no additional overhead or fixed staffing costs \u2014 and they can do so in a way that is true to their brand,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">John Ellis<\/span>, CEO of Soothe. &#8220;For boutique hotels, it&#8217;s an easy way to offer a premium guest experience and for big hotels it maximizes periods of high demand. It&#8217;s a win win.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Health and wellness is more important than ever, and we are thrilled to help the hospitality industry meet growing demand for wellness-centric offerings,&#8221; added <span class=\"xn-person\">James Murphy<\/span>, Chief Sales Officer at Soothe. &#8220;In 2022, we were proud to fill 92% of requested shifts from our spa partners, ultimately helping non-spa and spa properties alike to unlock new revenue streams and improve the guest experience.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Soothe partner platform has been successfully adopted by over 100 properties across the top luxury hotel brands through its inaugural beta program. The platform integrates seamlessly into a partner&#8217;s existing website, appearing as a customized, branded concierge booking tool for customers. On the back end, partners have access to a pool of thousands of qualified, vetted, and licensed providers who can provide the desired service on-demand. Should the property already offer wellness services through on-site staff, spa managers can make shifts available through Soothe&#8217;s platform, allowing partners to increase availability to better serve their guests and capture potentially lost revenue. These shifts are equally valuable to many wellness providers who want flexible, part-time work in a spa environment.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to partner with Soothe to bring our guests the very best in massage bespoke services and in-room offerings. The pilot program has exceeded our expectations, and we are excited to offer our guests a unique and personalized experience that they won&#8217;t find anywhere else,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Lucy Martin<\/span>, General Manager, <u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3834393-1&amp;h=2998574767&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayfairhousemiami.com%2F&amp;a=Mayfair+House+Hotel+and+Garden\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Mayfair House Hotel and Garden<\/a><\/u>\u00a0in <span class=\"xn-location\">Miami, Florida<\/span>. &#8220;We look forward to a continued partnership with Soothe to provide unparalleled luxury services to our guests.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have been working with Soothe for almost a year now and have had nothing but positive experiences,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Benjamin Donat<\/span>, Director of Spa at the <u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3834393-1&amp;h=1149725377&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairmont.com%2Faustin%2F&amp;a=Fairmont+Austin\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><span class=\"xn-person\">Fairmont Austin<\/span><\/a><\/u>. &#8220;The Account manager works closely with you, so you get the staff that you need and your expectations are met.
