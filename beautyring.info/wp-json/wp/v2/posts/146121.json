Wyndham&#8217;s Board has evaluated Choice&#8217;s proposal carefully and in its entirety. The Board has been explicitly clear that in order to make a proposal viable for shareholders, Choice must adequately address the three key issues Wyndham has repeatedly raised: insufficient valuation, unattractive consideration mix and asymmetrical regulatory risk. Despite the Company&#8217;s efforts to engage with Choice, Choice has demonstrated that it is unable, or simply unwilling, to propose a complete offer package addressing these three issues.<\/p>\n<p>Wyndham&#8217;s Board believes all eight of its nominees are more qualified with the right mix of skills and highly relevant expertise \u2013 including decades of hotel franchising, international business and public company operating experience \u2013 to oversee the successful execution of Wyndham&#8217;s global strategy and deliver the most value to shareholders. The Board&#8217;s Corporate Governance Committee, comprised solely of Independent Directors, conducted interviews with each of Choice&#8217;s eight nominees and determined that they lack the skills, expertise and background in key areas critical to Wyndham&#8217;s business and have been hand-picked by Choice with the sole objective of selling Wyndham for far less than the Company is worth.<\/p>\n<p>The Company&#8217;s definitive proxy materials will be filed and mailed soon, including the <b>WHITE<\/b>\u00a0proxy card with instructions for how to vote. Your vote <b><u>FOR ONLY<\/u><\/b> Wyndham&#8217;s eight highly-qualified Director nominees on the <b><u>WHITE<\/u><\/b>\u00a0proxy card will be critical for our upcoming 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Wyndham&#8217;s Board also urges shareholders to discard any materials or blue proxy card they may receive from Choice.
