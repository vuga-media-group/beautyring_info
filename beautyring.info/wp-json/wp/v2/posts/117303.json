It is the first and one-of-a-kind capsule collection by FOXYLAB NEW YORK, created in collaboration with worlds top athletes and artists. FOXYLAB NEW YORK will donate 10% of all the profits from the sales of this Streetwear fashion collection to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/voices.org.ua\/en\/who-we-are\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external sponsored\" style=\"color: purple;\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">Voices of Children<\/a><span style=\"color: rgb(53, 53, 53);\">, a non-profit organization that helps Ukrainian children cope with the consequences of the war against Ukraine.<\/span><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_FoxyLab_NY_streetwear_fashion_2022_USA-20_1652155881.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV FoxyLab NY streetwear fashion 2022 USA 20 1652155881 jpg\"><\/p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(53, 53, 53);\">It all started in March 2021 with debates about the powerful impact of art on different industries, and it led the FOXYLAB NEW YORK founder <\/span><strong style=\"color: rgb(53, 53, 53);\">Oxana De Castro<\/strong><span style=\"color: rgb(53, 53, 53);\"> to a realization that sport is one of the most artistic, creative, and free-spirited phenomena that meets FOXYLAB NEW YORK adventurous identity. Then, there was the selection of a list of sports that reflect the ethics of FOXYLAB NEW YORK. The list initially included many disciplines, but then was narrowed down to six: athletics, handball, modern pentathlon, 3x3 basketball, artistic gymnastics, and beach volleyball. These sports share common values with FOXYLAB NEW YORK: audacity, heart, friskiness, courage, and ingenuity.<\/span><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_FoxyLab_NY_streetwear_fashion_2022_USA-3_1652155915.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV FoxyLab NY streetwear fashion 2022 USA 3 1652155915 jpg\"><\/p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(53, 53, 53);\">The next major step was to find those athletes who share one more fundamental thing with the brand: creativity. FOXYLAB NEW YORK interviewed around 100 athletes from all over the planet, before the six allies were selected, those who compete with daring expression and introduce innovativeness into their sports, like true artists. Given the challenging tournament schedule, preparation for the major competition of the four (this time five) years and depletion from traveling and rigid training in difficult post-covid time, FOXYLAB NEW YORK aimed to challenge the imagination of athletes and extract the pure ideas inspired by their lifestyle and professional career in sports. Each athlete had to go back in time and recall all the little moments where the connection with art played a definite role in forming their character and later helped build their athletic performance.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_FoxyLab_NY_streetwear_fashion_2022_USA-9_1652155941.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV FoxyLab NY streetwear fashion 2022 USA 9 1652155941 jpg\"><\/p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(53, 53, 53);\">As the dots between art and sport were connected, each athlete was assigned an artist-partner to embody their ideas within unique personal designs and bring them to life. To match each team of artist and athlete, a distinct personal style of each artist was carefully evaluated, and the points of intersection with the stories of each athlete were found. The goal was to establish chemistry and perfect mutual understanding between the two creators. Supervised by the FOXYLAB NEW YORK team, the six pairs of athletes and artists from different countries worked together for three months to carve out their final designs. FOXYLAB NEW YORK placed the prints on six oversized signature t-shirts and marked each piece with a special tag with the names of both creators, their signatures, and a brief description of the art fashion collaboration.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_FoxyLab_NY_streetwear_fashion_2022_USA-8_1652155971.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV FoxyLab NY streetwear fashion 2022 USA 8 1652155971 jpg\"><\/p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(53, 53, 53);\">DISCLOSING ATHLETES CREATIVITY capsule merged different nationalities, cultures, and visions, stimulated by the creative environment of FOXYLAB NEW YORK. When put together, sport and art prove that they are both moved by creativity of the performers, and their combined work leads to extraordinary results.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/24Fashion_TV_FoxyLab_NY_streetwear_fashion_2022_USA-17_1652156472.jpg\" alt=\"24Fashion TV FoxyLab NY streetwear fashion 2022 USA 17 1652156472 jpg\"><\/p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(53, 53, 53);\">Introduced below are the pairs of athletes and artists that worked together.

Ulyanas family comes from nobility and had their own coat of arms that contained a unicorn, an image, which ties to Ulyanas life closely  one of the disciplines in modern pentathlon is equestrian show jumping. Ulyana has a deep love for and feels horses. The unicorn on the family coat of arms represents her dream of going to the Olympics and becoming a top professional athlete, a dream that she brought to reality with her hard work.

His style is very recognizable, because he grew up and spent most of his life in Harlem, which imprinted its culture in him.&nbsp;Dominique believes that ones wardrobe must give its owner a feeling of confidence and underscore their authenticity.
