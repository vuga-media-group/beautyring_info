Holmberg Professor of American Music at The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, His Rabun Gap was inspired by feelings experienced while exploring the beautiful mountains surrounding the Rabun Gap-Wolffork Valley of the Blue Ridge Mountains.<\/p>\n<p>John McGinn holds music degrees from Harvard and Stanford Universities. His Three Preludes are part of a growing collection of piano pieces based on free improvisations captured and transcribed with the help of MIDI software.<\/p>\n<p>Joel Rosenbaum studied at the San Francisco Conservatory and Indiana University before embarking on a career as a film composer. He was nominated for an Academy Award for his work on the score of The Color Purple and won two Emmy Awards for his many scores for television.
