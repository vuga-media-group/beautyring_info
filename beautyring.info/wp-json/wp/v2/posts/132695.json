Leaders are also concerned about supply and demand, lack of leadership, keeping employees goal-oriented, inflation, cost of goods and labor, employees not retaining information or not caring, and employees being afraid to engage with customers.<\/p>\n<p><u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.edume.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">eduMe<\/a><\/u>\u00a0CEO and founder <span class=\"xn-person\">Jacob Waern<\/span> said: &#8220;The retail and hospitality industries are facing a number of challenges, but to see a lack of confidence around customer service and customer experience abilities so keenly felt, especially when 93% of leaders report they are spending considerable time training employees, shows the stark need for a shake up in the methods being used to provide these employees with skills and knowledge.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The report also found the proliferation of &#8216;traditional&#8217; and outdated methods being used in these frontline industries. Some 92% still make majority use of face-to-face training, or desktop based learning. All systems that require time away from customers &#8211; and delivered in a way that lowers engagement, relevance and accessibility.<\/p>\n<p>Waern continued: &#8220;Businesses need to invest in better employee training systems and processes in order to ensure that their frontline teams are equipped to provide the best possible service. We work with a number of companies that have large frontline workforces and the impact they&#8217;ve seen when employees have access to information and training on their mobile device, in exciting short forms like &#8216;TikTok for learning&#8217; as we&#8217;ve been described, has been immeasurable in bringing notable improvements in customer service, and importantly, business metrics like retention.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another challenge highlighted was the lack of accessibility. Though 24% thought better accessibility to training would improve the outcome of training initiatives, 62% do not currently embed training into HR systems like Workday and communications tools like Microsoft Teams, that they report employees are accessing daily.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the challenges, leaders are committed to upskilling employees, and understand the integral part they play in providing better customer experiences, stating &#8220;employees that go above and beyond&#8221; as a bigger influence on CX, greater than even product quality or price.<\/p>\n<p>You can see a summary of the key findings and download the full report here: <u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.edume.com\/downloads\/retail-hospitality-report-2024\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.edume.com\/downloads\/retail-hospitality-report-2024<\/a><\/u><\/p>\n<p>eduMe are sponsoring and exhibiting at the Workday customer events, Workday Rising, in <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-chron\">September 26 to 29<\/span>, and in <span class=\"xn-location\">Barcelona<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-chron\">November 14 to 16<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><b>About eduMe<\/b><\/p>\n<p>eduMe is the training platform of choice for the frontline. eduMe allows global companies, including Uber, Marriott and Hilton to seamlessly deliver immersive, consumer-grade training, in the flow of work, allowing them to improve productivity, retention and safety. eduMe is integrated into the tools your frontline already uses, such as MS Teams, Workday, Braze, Beekeeper and Fountain. eduMe is headquartered in <span class=\"xn-location\">London, UK<\/span> with offices in <span class=\"xn-location\">Santa Monica<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">USA<\/span>.
