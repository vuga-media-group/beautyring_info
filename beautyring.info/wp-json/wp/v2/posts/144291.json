This special event will honor the hope, triumphs and world-renowned musical career of child violin prodigy and Holocaust Survivor Shony Alex Braun\u2019s life, and include a screening of this new documentary, followed by an intermission, live musical performance, and cast and crew Q and A. <\/p>\n<p>Los Angeles-based Director Greg DeHart\u2019s feature-length \u201cSymphony of the Holocaust\u201d documentary is a must-see film that highlights the inspiring example of Shony Alex Braun, who miraculously survived four concentration camps, and wrote a symphony about his experiences. Shony was only 13 years old when separated from his mother and sister at the Auschwitz gates, who were tragically murdered in the gas chambers.<\/p>\n<p>While in captivity, Shony was ordered to carry dead bodies to the crematorium, and composed the \u201cSymphony of the Holocaust\u201d in his mind as a way to escape the horrors of war. Shony believed that he survived Dachau by playing the violin for the Nazis. Sadly, his father and brother were also murdered in the death camps. This film is a haunting, yet hopeful testament to the memory of the millions of Jews murdered by the Nazis during World War II.<\/p>\n<p>After the war, Shony and his wife Shari Mendelovits (also a survivor) immigrated to the United States, became proud U.S. citizens, started a loving family, and moved to Los Angeles. This violin prodigy wrote 200 musical works and performed for Kings, Queens and Presidents. Shony\u2019s \u201cSymphony of the Holocaust\u201d was his \u201cmasterpiece\u201d, and he longed to play it at Auschwitz. <\/p>\n<p>Braun first performed his symphony in Los Angeles in 1988, and it was later nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in Music. Unfortunately, Shony died from pneumonia in 2002 before fulfilling his final wish. <\/p>\n<p>In 2023, Sunn Stream President and Executive Producer Garrett Sutton greenlit the \u201cSymphony of the Holocaust\u201d film. In this documentary, Shony\u2019s family goes on a bittersweet journey to first locate his prized violin that was on loan to Armenian violinist Erik Ghukasyan. The family then travels to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp gates to fulfill Shony\u2019s final wish by having his \u201cSymphony of the Holocaust\u201d played by Erik \u201cto bring some beauty with Shony\u2019s music to this horrific place\u201d. <\/p>\n<p>When asked \u201cWho was Shony Braun?\u201d, daughter Dinah Braun Griffin expressed her love and admiration by emphasizing, \u201cMy dad was a hero to me. He focused his life on joy and forgiveness, rarely spoke about the war, and practiced violin 3-4 hours per day.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Director DeHart adds, \u201cWe hope this film resonates with people because it is a universal story across cultures and time periods about a unique triumph. We have an Armenian violinist Erik Ghukasyan fulfilling a Jewish Holocaust survivor\u2019s dream. Shony\u2019s daughter, Dinah married a Christian, and Shony\u2019s former violin restorer and good friend, was German.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To reach a worldwide audience, this Sunn Stream \u201cOriginal\u201d documentary premiered on January 27, 2024, and is now also available to watch on SunnStream.com streaming service, and on multiple platforms, including Apple TV, IOS, Google Play, Roku, and Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>LIVE MUSICAL PERFORMANCE:<\/p>\n<p>After the 71-minute film screening, Dr. Noreen Green (Founding Artistic Director and Conductor of the Los Angeles Jewish Symphony) will conduct the premiere of a chamber version of the \u201cSymphony of the Holocaust\u201d with Armenian violinist Erik Ghukasyan playing with an orchestra.
