The robotic refueling system is used during offshore replenishment to safely refuel unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). A methodology has been demonstrated for autonomously refueling Navy vessels in significant sea states by the Rapid Autonomous Fuel Transfer (RAFT) project.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Using robotic refueling robots in space, NASA demonstrated its robotic refueling mission (RRM) successfully. As well as the automotive industry, automated refueling technology could be used in the aviation sector to decrease inefficiency and decrease downtime. A robotic platform for a free-flying service satellite has been developed since 2009 that is capable of accessing, repairing, and refueling satellites in GEO. As part of the project, the team is also explored ways to provide satellite services from low Earth orbit, or LEO. As part of this campaign, RRM has developed technology. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Get Full Access of this Report @ <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=D6OumMKTIKocfvj8XR5mwTVxh_iwKRsjqzCvJvknerVGjbuG7T3ui5xfmT0tPhxTTrXcbPVTwggfyo__m8dn9D-vnbD30RX_Wn9s-HsB_-CtpI30ravKlIgvmT-gUKcVBpRX6oAVGlFE3UQU209vwdVJYKk2ObhrwclJG-__NzVJ-EIaRbdNuiJkqY6ptEJy\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>https:\/\/www.persistencemarketresearch.com\/checkout\/33485<\/u><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Key Takeaways from Market Study<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>According to the forecast, mining applications will hold <strong>40.6%<\/strong> of the market by the end of the forecast period.<\/li>\n<li>The gasoline market is projected to grow at a <strong>CAGR of 40.7%<\/strong> from 2023 to 2033.<\/li>\n<li>By 2033, the United States estimates project robotic refueling systems will generate <strong>$368.3 million<\/strong> in revenues.<\/li>\n<li>By 2033, sales of robotic refueling systems are expected to reach <strong>US$ 453.4 million<\/strong> in Japan.<\/li>\n<li>A projection shows that by 2033 the South Korean robotic refueling system market will grow by <strong>41.3%.<\/strong>\n    <\/li>\n<li>In 2033, the Chinese market is expected to be worth <strong>US$673.6 million<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p align=\"justify\"><em>\u201cRobotics and advanced technologies will play a major role in the market over the next few years.
