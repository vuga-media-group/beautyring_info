The planned separation of Seaport Entertainment from Howard Hughes will refine the identity of HHH as a pure-play real estate company focused solely on its portfolio of acclaimed master planned communities.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Anton is an outstanding leader in the entertainment and resort world. It speaks to the quality of our entertainment assets that we have been able to recruit an executive of his caliber to Howard Hughes,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Bill Ackman<\/span>, Chairman of the Board of Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. &#8220;Anton&#8217;s experience, track record, and superb leadership skills will facilitate the creation, management, and eventual spinoff of Seaport Entertainment, positioning it and Howard Hughes for greater success as more-focused, easier-to-understand companies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In his over\u00a0thirty-year career in the entertainment and hospitality industries, Nikodemus has led the development and operations of many of the travel industry&#8217;s premier destination brands. He most recently served as President &amp; COO of CityCenter for MGM Resorts International, where he oversaw operations for The Cosmopolitan of <span class=\"xn-location\">Las Vegas<\/span>, Vdara Hotel &amp; Spa, and ARIA Resort &amp; <span>Casino<\/span>. He was also responsible for the creation and development of the MGM National Harbor Hotel &amp; <span>Casino<\/span> in <span class=\"xn-location\">Maryland<\/span> and the MGM Springfield in <span class=\"xn-location\">Massachusetts<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to joining MGM in 2005, Nikodemus oversaw the redevelopment and management of the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club. He previously held management roles at luxury resorts including The Arizona Biltmore Resort &amp; Spa and The Phoenician Resort. Nikodemus\u00a0earned a B.S. in Business Management and Marketing from <span class=\"xn-org\">Arizona State University<\/span>. He completed the Advanced Finance Program at the Wharton School of the <span class=\"xn-org\">University of Pennsylvania<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I am excited to lead this new division of Howard Hughes and join the outstanding team that is forming Seaport Entertainment,&#8221; said Nikodemus. &#8220;There is tremendous opportunity ahead as we harness the potential and unlock the value inherent in these one-of-a-kind assets located in <span class=\"xn-location\">New York<\/span> and Las Vegas\u2014two of our country&#8217;s most dynamic entertainment destinations\u2014and pursue new opportunities for accelerated growth.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The anticipated spinoff of Seaport Entertainment would allow the new company to operate independently as a pure-play entertainment enterprise, equipped with a robust team of industry leaders to ensure its long-term success. The spinoff is expected to be completed year end 2024, but there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the spinoff or that the spinoff will ultimately occur.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The assets of the Seaport Entertainment lie at the intersection of real estate and entertainment,&#8221; said David R.\u00a0O&#8217;Reilly, Chief Executive Officer of Howard Hughes. &#8220;Anton brings tremendous experience building some of the country&#8217;s most-acclaimed entertainment destinations, and we are fortunate to have him taking the helm of this exciting new division of Howard Hughes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>About Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. <br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Howard Hughes Holdings Inc. owns, manages, and develops commercial, residential, and mixed-use real estate throughout the U.S. Its award-winning assets include the country&#8217;s preeminent portfolio of master planned communities, as well as operating properties and development opportunities including: the Seaport in <span class=\"xn-location\">New York City<\/span>; <span class=\"xn-location\">Downtown Columbia<\/span><sup>\u00ae<\/sup> in <span class=\"xn-location\">Maryland<\/span>; <span class=\"xn-location\">The Woodlands<\/span><sup>\u00ae<\/sup>,\u00a0Bridgeland<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> and The Woodlands Hills<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> in the <span class=\"xn-location\">Greater Houston, Texas<\/span> area; Summerlin<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> in <span class=\"xn-location\">Las Vegas<\/span>; <span class=\"xn-location\">Ward Village<\/span><sup>\u00ae<\/sup> in <span class=\"xn-location\">Honolulu<\/span>, Hawai\u02bbi; and Teravalis in the <span class=\"xn-location\">Greater Phoenix, Arizona<\/span> area.
