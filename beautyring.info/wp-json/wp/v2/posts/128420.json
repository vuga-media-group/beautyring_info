The vast majority of the restricted cash is comprised of lender and manager held reserves.\u00a0 At the end of the quarter, there was also <span class=\"xn-money\">$19.0 million<\/span> in due from third-party hotel managers, which is primarily the Company&#8217;s cash held by one of its property managers and is also available to fund hotel operating costs.<\/li>\n<li>Net working capital at the end of the quarter was <span class=\"xn-money\">$344.0 million<\/span>.<\/li>\n<li>Capex invested during the quarter was <span class=\"xn-money\">$34.0 million<\/span>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>RECENT OPERATING HIGHLIGHTS <\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>During the quarter, the Company extended its BAML Highland Pool Loan until <span class=\"xn-chron\">April 2024<\/span>. As part of this extension, the Company paid down the existing loan balance by <span class=\"xn-money\">$45 million<\/span>.<\/li>\n<li>During the quarter, the Company refinanced its mortgage loans for the 157-room La Posada de <span class=\"xn-location\">Santa Fe<\/span> in <span class=\"xn-location\">Santa Fe, New Mexico<\/span>, which had a final maturity date in <span class=\"xn-chron\">November 2023<\/span>, and the 252-room <span class=\"xn-person\">Hilton Alexandria<\/span> in <span class=\"xn-location\">Alexandria, Virginia<\/span>, which had a final maturity date in June 2023.\u00a0 These two loans were the Company&#8217;s only final debt maturities in 2023.<\/li>\n<li>To date, the Company has issued approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$51 million<\/span> of its non-traded preferred stock.<\/li>\n<li>During the quarter, the Company extended its KEYS Pool C loan. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company extended its KEYS Pool D loan and its KEYS Pool E loan. In the interest of protecting stockholder value and liquidity, the Company elected not to make the required paydowns to extend its KEYS Pool A loan, its KEYS Pool B loan and its KEYS Pool F loan.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>CAPITAL STRUCTURE<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b><span>As of <span class=\"xn-chron\">June 30, 2023<\/span>, the Company had total loans of <span class=\"xn-money\">$3.7 billion<\/span> with a blended average interest rate of 7.8%, taking into account in-the-money interest rate caps. Excluding the non-extended KEYS loans, based on the current level of <\/span>LIBOR<span> and <\/span>SOFR<span> and the corresponding interest rate caps, approximately 95% of the Company&#8217;s debt is effectively fixed and approximately 5% is effectively floating.\u00a0 Excluding the non-extended KEYS loans, currently twelve of the Company&#8217;s hotels are in cash traps.<\/span>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>During the quarter, the Company extended its BAML Highland Pool Loan until <span class=\"xn-chron\">April 2024<\/span>. As part of this extension, the Company paid down the existing loan balance by <span class=\"xn-money\">$45 million<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Also, during the quarter, the Company successfully refinanced its mortgage loans for the 157-room La Posada de <span class=\"xn-location\">Santa Fe<\/span> in <span class=\"xn-location\">Santa Fe, New Mexico<\/span>, which had a final maturity date in <span class=\"xn-chron\">November 2023<\/span>, and the 252-room <span class=\"xn-person\">Hilton Alexandria<\/span> in <span class=\"xn-location\">Alexandria, Virginia<\/span>, which had a final maturity date in <span class=\"xn-chron\">June 2023<\/span>. These two loans were the Company&#8217;s only final debt maturities in 2023. The new, non-recourse loan totals <span class=\"xn-money\">$98.5 million<\/span> and has a three-year initial term with two one-year extension options, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The loan is interest only and provides for a floating interest rate of SOFR + 4.00%.<\/p>\n<p>During the quarter, the Company extended its KEYS Pool C loan \u2013 secured by five hotels with a paydown of approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$62 million<\/span>. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company extended its KEYS Pool D loan \u2013 secured by five hotels with a paydown of approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$26 million<\/span>, and its KEYS Pool E loan \u2013 secured by five hotels with a paydown of approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$41 million<\/span>.\u00a0 In the interest of protecting stockholder value and liquidity, the Company elected not to make the required paydowns to extend its KEYS Pool A loan \u2013 secured by seven hotels, its KEYS Pool B loan \u2013 secured by seven hotels, and its KEYS Pool F loan \u2013 secured by five hotels. The Company noted that proactively choosing not to extend three of these loan pools improves its balance sheet by lowering leverage and materially improves future cash flows. The combination of the paydowns and the removal of the debt associated with the pools the Company did not extend will lower the Company&#8217;s debt by approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$700 million<\/span>.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The Company did not pay a dividend on its common stock and common units for the second quarter ended <span class=\"xn-chron\">June 30, 2023<\/span>. The Board of Directors will continue to monitor the situation and assess future quarterly common dividend declarations. The Company is current on the dividends on its outstanding preferred stock and plans to pay dividends on its outstanding preferred stock on a current basis going forward.<\/p>\n<p>The Company commenced the offering of its Non-Traded Preferred Equity during the third quarter of 2022.\u00a0To date, the Company has issued 1,935,377 shares of its Series J and 90,323 shares of its Series K non-traded preferred stock raising approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$50.6 million<\/span> of gross proceeds. The expected use of proceeds for the Non-Traded Preferred Equity is acquisitions, paying down debt, and other general corporate purposes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;During the second quarter, our portfolio delivered strong operating results,&#8221; commented <span class=\"xn-person\">Rob Hays<\/span>, Ashford Trust&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been extremely encouraged with the growth in both occupancy and ADR that we&#8217;ve been able to achieve and believe that strong performance reflects our high-quality, geographically diverse portfolio. Further, we&#8217;re encouraged that the vast majority of our hotels are now out of their cash traps.&#8221; Mr. Hays added, &#8220;On the capital management front, proactively choosing not to extend three of the KEYS loan pools improves our balance sheet by lowering leverage and materially improves our future cash flows. Looking ahead, our portfolio remains well positioned to outperform and, from a capital structure and balance sheet perspective, we will continue to focus on paying off our corporate financing and raising capital through our non-traded preferred stock.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>INVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL AND SIMULCAST<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. will conduct a conference call on <span class=\"xn-chron\">Wednesday, August 2, 2023<\/span>, at <span class=\"xn-chron\">11:00 a.m. ET<\/span>.
