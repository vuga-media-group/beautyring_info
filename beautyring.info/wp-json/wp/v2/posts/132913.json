Marriott will outline its plan to add 230,000 to 270,000 net rooms over three years, expanding its industry-leading global portfolio to nearly 1.8 million rooms by year-end 2025.\u00a0 This represents a three-year CAGR for net rooms of 5.0 to 5.5 percent. \u00a0In addition, the company&#8217;s model assumes global RevPAR growth at a two-year CAGR of 3 to 6 percent from 2023 to 2025, after rising 12 to 14 percent this year.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With global travel poised for continued robust growth, our strategy is to deliver the best brands and experiences for consumers, to attract and retain the most loyal guests and to be in more places around the world. These are our three paths to win,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Anthony Capuano<\/span>, President and Chief Executive Officer, <span class=\"xn-person\">Marriott International<\/span>. &#8220;As consumers continue to prioritize travel and experiences, we are focused on transforming our technology platform while leveraging our powerful revenue engines and our leading Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program to connect people through the power of travel. \u00a0With our extraordinary associates around the world, I am incredibly optimistic about Marriott&#8217;s future.&#8221;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Given the assumptions in its three-year model, the company could produce the following results:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Total gross fee revenues could rise 16 to 18 percent year-over-year in 2023 and at a 6.5 to 9.5 percent two-year CAGR to reach <span class=\"xn-money\">$5.4<\/span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$5.8 billion<\/span> in 2025.<\/li>\n<li>Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) could increase 18 to 21 percent year-over-year in 2023 and at a 7 to 10 percent two-year CAGR to reach <span class=\"xn-money\">$5.2<\/span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$5.7 billion<\/span> in 2025.<\/li>\n<li>Adjusted diluted earnings per share (adjusted diluted EPS) could rise 25 to 29 percent year-over-year in 2023 and at a 10 to 15 percent two-year CAGR to reach <span class=\"xn-money\">$10.10<\/span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$11.45<\/span> in 2025.<\/li>\n<li>Shareholders could see <span class=\"xn-money\">$1.9<\/span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$2.0 billion<\/span> in dividends, assuming a 25 percent payout ratio, and <span class=\"xn-money\">$9.8<\/span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$11.6 billion<\/span> in share repurchases, for total shareholder returns of <span class=\"xn-money\">$11.7<\/span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$13.6 billion<\/span> over the three-year period through 2025.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&#8220;Our asset-light and resilient business model drives powerful results,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Leeny Oberg<\/span>, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Development. &#8220;We expect to produce significant free cash flow and earnings growth over the next few years and create meaningful value for our shareholders.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>Growth Areas<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>As part of the presentation of its three-year financial model, Marriott will discuss the priority it is placing on generating valuable global rooms growth over the long term. The company will discuss its efforts to grow the distribution of its more than 30 leading brands, while also introducing new brands and offerings that meet customers&#8217; evolving needs. \u00a0It will highlight the following key priorities that support its growth plans \u2013 midscale, extended stay, leisure and luxury, and conversions.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The company expects to follow a tailored development approach in its expansion in the affordable midscale segment, recognizing differences by continent to accommodate regional customer and owner expectations. \u00a0To date, Marriott has completed an acquisition (the City Express brand portfolio) in the <span class=\"xn-location\">Caribbean<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Latin America<\/span> region, created a midscale extended stay brand in the U.S. &amp; <span class=\"xn-location\">Canada<\/span> region (StudioRes) and, just this morning, announced a new brand for its <span class=\"xn-location\">Europe<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Middle East<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Africa<\/span> region (Four Points Express by Sheraton). \u00a0The company also plans to further expand in the extended stay segment, having recently announced the launch of Apartments by Marriott Bonvoy.<\/p>\n<p>Marriott is also emphasizing luxury and leisure offerings.\u00a0 It is currently leading in luxury distribution globally, with nearly 500 open luxury hotels and 17 percent of the market, approximately 1.5 times the size of its next largest competitor. The company remains focused on extending its leading position with another 225 luxury properties in the pipeline.\u00a0 Conversions, particularly multi-unit conversions,\u00a0are also a critical piece of the company&#8217;s overall growth strategy.\u00a0 In the first six months of 2023, conversions accounted for 63 percent of room signings, including the MGM Resorts transaction, and 25 percent excluding MGM.<\/p>\n<p>Continued robust growth in Marriott&#8217;s branded residential business, cobrand credit card offerings and other adjacencies such as The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection are also expected to enhance the company&#8217;s fee growth.\u00a0 Marriott expects to continue its disciplined approach to investing capital in long term value enhancing projects that drive cash flow growth.<\/p>\n<p>Marriott will provide a live webcast of today&#8217;s investor and security analyst conference.
