While over-the-counter products are more commonly used than prescription medications, they do not require supervision from a healthcare professional, and clear guidelines for choosing breastfeeding-safe nonprescription products can be shockingly hard to find.<\/p>\n<p>The information varies depending on where you look, and can oftentimes lead to more questions. Even for professionals like pharmacists and lactation consultants, there\u2019s no definitive, evidence-based resource for which products a lactating parent can safely use while continuing to breastfeed their child. Expert pharmacist Dr. Frank J. Nice is hoping to end this gap in essential health information with the release of The Breastfeeding Family\u2019s Guide to Nonprescription Drugs and Everyday Products, published through <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.platypusmedia.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Platypus Media<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When choosing a product, it is important for breastfeeding parents to know that a medication or substance that is entirely safe for adults may be harmful when passed to an infant through breastmilk. And, even if a medication is safe for both parent and child, there is a chance the product could interfere with breastmilk production. Whether curing a headache, taming allergies, or taking an herbal supplement, navigating the bewildering variety of health products as a breastfeeding parent can be difficult. <\/p>\n<p>For example, there are some Zicam products that are compatible with breastfeeding, while others are unsafe. This is also true for some Excedrin, Alka-Seltzer, and Pepto-Bismol products, and dozens of other well-known and often-turned-to brands. In this comprehensive guide, Dr. Nice provides simple guidelines for making safe product choices. The Breastfeeding Family\u2019s Guide includes up-to-date safety information for over 1,700 different products in addition to active ingredients, and is the only book to include caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, and CBD, as well as cosmetic, herbal, and dietary products. With information organized in tables that are clear and easy to use, Dr. Nice takes the stress out of making smart and healthy choices.<\/p>\n<p>Pharmacists, obstetricians, pediatricians, midwives, nurse practitioners, lactation consultants, and parents will find this an invaluable resource. As Jack Newman, MD, FRCPC, IBCLC, co-author of What Doctors Don\u2019t Know About Breastfeeding and Breastfeeding: Empowering Parents says, \u201cThis book puts order in the confusion of overwhelming product options. Highly recommended!\u201d Lisa Marasco, MA, IBCLC, FILCA, and co-author of Making More Milk, adds \u201cNo breastfeeding parent or professional should be without it!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Frank J. Nice is the author of the Nonprescription Drugs for the Breastfeeding Mother, which has been the gold-standard reference guide since 2007. His new book, which contains updated tables and extensive additional content, replaces it as the ultimate OTC drug and herb safety book for breastfeeding families. He says, \u201cI wrote this book to help healthcare professionals make correct recommendations, and to help consumers ensure that the products they use for themselves are safe for their infants.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Nice has practiced as a consultant, lecturer, and author on medications and breastfeeding for over 45 years. He holds advanced degrees in pharmacy administration and public administration and certification in public health pharmacy. He has worked for the U.S. Public Health Service, practiced at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and served as a pharmacist and project manager at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Dr. Nice has multiple published books and has authored over 50 peer-reviewed articles on the use of prescription medications, over-the-counter products, and herbals during<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nbreastfeeding. He lives in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.<\/p>\n<p>Platypus Media is a small independent press in Washington, D.C.
