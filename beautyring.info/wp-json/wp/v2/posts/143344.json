Before leaving to find a fresh meal for her nestlings, Mama Bird reminds her that she must be brave if she wants to learn and grow. <\/p>\n<p>Little Bird knows her mother is right\u2014but she just isn\u2019t ready. Still full of nerves, she solicits the advice of the friends she knows and trusts\u2014Bee, Squirrel, the Sun, the Wind, and the Tree in which she lives. Finally, bolstered and prepared by advice from each of these helpers, Little Bird knows she is ready to soar\u2014and become Brave Bird.<\/p>\n<p>Like Little Bird, young children constantly face new, potentially scary situations\u2014from going to a new school to visiting the dentist to trying to make new friends. Even adults who have already weathered a few challenges might sometimes encounter new and nerve-wracking situations we must navigate. The fact is, the older we get, the braver we all have to be\u2014and the more we all need Little Bird\u2019s guidance in developing resilience, navigating past our fears, and soaring into the next phases of our lives.<\/p>\n<p>Enhanced with gorgeous, soothing multimedia illustrations that offer comfort to nervous kids, &#8216;Brave Bird&#8217; is releasing today, February 12, 2024.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Little Bird became Brave Bird when she found the courage to fly.
