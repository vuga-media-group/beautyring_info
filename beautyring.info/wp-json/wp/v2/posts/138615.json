His <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/andrewmatthews.com\/books\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">books<\/a> have sold over 8 million copies in 48 languages.<\/p>\n<p>Says Andrew, \u201cEverybody fails and everybody hurts. In BOUNCING BACK! I pinpoint 7 things that resilient people do &#8211; that anyone can do.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He adds, \u201cNo one is born extraordinary. We become extraordinary, resilient, unstoppable by conquering circumstances we didn\u2019t choose. Persistence matters more than talent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>BOUNCING BACK! is illustrated with Andrew Matthews\u2019 much-loved cartoons. His characters make complex ideas simple &#8211; and memorable. The book has been embraced by banks, software corporations, and by universities as recommended reading for their staff.<\/p>\n<p>Andrew\u2019s first book, BEING HAPPY! became a publishing phenomenon, selling over 3 million copies. It was recommended by psychologists to their patients. It was the basis of University courses in the USA. World golfing #1 Nick Faldo revealed, \u201cBEING HAPPY! Is my favourite book because it helped me win the British Open!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Matthews\u2019 other titles include FOLLOW YOUR HEART, HAPPINESS NOW, HAPPINESS in HARD TIMES and HOW LIFE WORKS.<\/p>\n<p>Andrew Matthews\u2019 books are bestsellers in the USA, UK, and his home country, Australia. But why are they chart toppers in China, Vietnam, South Korea, the Philippines, Russia, Mexico, Hungary, Poland, Croatia and even Iran? He explains, \u201cPeople want simple messages in simple language. My cartoons help readers remember the message.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The first printing of BOUNCING BACK! sold out in 3 weeks. The Singapore launch at the Marina Bay Sands: all seats totally sold out. Andrew recently completed an author tour of Singapore and Malaysia where he addressed Motorola, Intel, Dell, Citibank, World Resorts, and the Singapore University of Social Sciences.<\/p>\n<p>An in-demand <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/andrewmatthews.com\/speaking\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">conference speaker<\/a>, Andrew Matthews has presented to over 1,000 corporations worldwide. He also speaks in prisons, sharing his message of bouncing back with Kajang Prison in Malaysia, in Changi Prison School and Kaki Bukit Centre Prison School in Singapore, and at the Mabel Basset Correctional Centre in Oklahoma. In January 2024, Andrew will address 400 executives in Dubai.<\/p>\n<p>BOUNCING BACK! is available worldwide on Amazon, in eBook and hardcopy.
