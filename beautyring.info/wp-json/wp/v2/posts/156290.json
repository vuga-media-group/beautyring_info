Witnessing diverse cultures and values furthered his desire to showcase the many solutions available, accessible, and in practice today.<\/p>\n<p>Setting Sail Along Maine\u2019s Rugged Coast<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nCombining his love for sailing with a film tour was a natural decision. &#8220;As I gained acceptance into Maine&#8217;s film festivals I dreamed of sailing with the film to ports up and down the coast,&#8221; Merkel explains. \u201cSome of Maine\u2019s most beautiful theaters answered our call. It also became clear that this film amplifies the work of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. There are these 2030 targets for 17 goals, however, our film documents societies decades ahead, making life better for people and the planet. Filming these tangible solutions globally and now sharing them on the big screen by the power of the wind fulfills a yearning \u2013 to not throw in the towel on my son\u2019s future.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>A Life Dedicated to Making a Difference<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSince witnessing the devastating Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, Merkel has committed himself to minimizing his environmental footprint and inspiring others to do the same. He transitioned into environmental activism and served as Dartmouth College\u2019s Sustainability Director for several years.<\/p>\n<p>Saving Walden\u2019s World\u2014The Film<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSupported by an Earthwatch Gaia Fellowship, Merkel explored sustainable living in Kerala, India, and the Himalayas. In 1995, he co-founded the Global Living Project, laying the groundwork for his film. Merkel&#8217;s firsthand observations of climate change effects spurred him to document cultures achieving significant carbon footprint reductions while advancing healthcare and education access.<\/p>\n<p>Expanding on this vision, Merkel journeyed to Slovenia, Cuba, and Kerala again, creating a film that celebrates these cultures&#8217; successes rather than highlighting their shortcomings. &#8220;What was so unusual is that people [in these countries] are used to Americans coming there to tell them they&#8217;re doing something wrong,&#8221; Merkel reflects. &#8220;I was asking about their successes\u2014and people really lit up.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The film Saving Walden\u2019s World showcases these sustainable alternatives, draws parallels to women\u2019s empowerment and reproductive rights, and underscores our collective capacity for social justice\u2014a vision intensified by Merkel&#8217;s experience as a parent. &#8220;Solutions are possible. A better world is possible,&#8221; he asserts. &#8220;We, as adults, must leave a better world for our children, not simply assume they&#8217;ll figure it out.&#8221;<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMaine and Beyond\u2026<\/p>\n<p>Each screening along the tour will spotlight one of the UN&#8217;s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, culminating in New York City during Climate Week and the UN Summit of the Future in September.<\/p>\n<p>See \u201cSaving Walden\u2019s World\u201d at These Maine Screenings and Festivals:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nJuly 28: Maine Outdoor Film Festival, Portland, MD<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAugust 4: The Strand, Rockland, ME<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAugust 11: Vacationland Film Festival, Biddeford, ME<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAugust 13: First Parish Church, Yarmouth, ME<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAugust 17: Harbor Theatre, Boothbay Harbor, ME<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAugust 26: Alamo Theatre, Bucksport, ME<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSeptember 1: Criterion Theatre, Bar Harbor, ME<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSeptember 8: St. Andrews Film Society, St. Andrews, NB<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nOctober 9: McHenry County College, Crystal Lake, IL<\/p>\n<p>Watch the film trailer and get tickets at SavingWaldensWorld.org<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis film will stir your heart.\u201d \u2014Vicki Robin, Author, Social Innovator<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJim Merkel offers a special mix of practicality and idealism; a workable mix.\u201d \u2014Bill McKibben, Climate Activist, Author<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a former engineer working on weapons who went through a dramatic change in consciousness, his words have a special power.\u201d \u2014Howard Zinn, author of A People&#8217;s History of the United States<\/p>\n<p>Saving Walden&#8217;s World thanks its sponsors: McHenry County College, Sierra Club Maine Chapter, Mabel Wadsworth Center, Alliance for Sears Island, Maine Film Association, UN Kerala Forum, UpStream Watch, Maine Media, Friends of Harriet L.
