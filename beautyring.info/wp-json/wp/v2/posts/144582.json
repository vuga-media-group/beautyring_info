Attendees of the event will learn &#8220;to connect and think more creatively, &#8221; she stated.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is particularly important for speakers and authors who are consistently working to develop new and innovative ways to deliver content that can inspire solutions to everyday problems.  If you can&#8217;t come up with a new twist on an old problem, you&#8217;ll be trying to solve the problem the same way and expecting different results. We know what that means; you\u2019ll be stuck with the problem forever. The experiential nature of the applied improvisational method from the arts is a solution with research to back it up,&#8221; Campbell asserts.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Campbell&#8217;s diverse background uniquely positions her to bridge the worlds of writing and performance through applied improvisation. The keynote is designed to provide speakers and authors with practical insights into using creative thinking to captivate audiences, enhance communication, and infuse a fresh perspective into their craft.<\/p>\n<p>After Campbell co-founded an improv and stand-up comedy company in the San Francisco area in the 90&#8217;s, she began teaching an applied version of the method to Silicon Valley businesses in 1995. &#8220;I realized there is a difference in the way performers learn improvisation, always looking for the funny in any situation, and the way groups or teams who aren&#8217;t getting along well need to learn it. &#8221; In the second instance, she realized, &#8221; I needed to spend much more time in both the introductory phase, to discharge the normal anxiety that people bring to this work,  and the post-exercise debriefing process.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Later, she completed her doctoral work with an interprofessional group of clinicians at Stanford&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Hospital by facilitating an applied improv workshop with longitudinal test-of-change results over a decade ago. &#8220;But this method is certainly not just for healthcare,&#8221; says Campbell. &#8220;My first applied improvisation groups were with Silicon Valley start-ups.&#8221;  Both her last two business books, Improv to Improve Healthcare and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.businessexpertpress.com\/books\/improv-to-improve-your-leadership-team-tear-down-walls-and-build-bridges\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Improv to Improve Your Leadership Team<\/a>, emerged out of this work.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo simplify the method, I&#8217;ve outlined  12 principles of applied improv that point to basic elements in the experiential learning environment. The first two are key for all business leaders, especially entrepreneurs, since the whole point of being inclusive is about relationships:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 Accept all offers (i.e., have an open mind about suggestions and reply \u201cYes, and\u2026\u201d before you say \u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 Risk being imperfect (for leaders, this is so difficult!)&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As both a storyteller and a healthcare professional, Dr. Candy Campbell has seamlessly integrated her dual expertise to craft a keynote that transcends traditional professional development. Attendees can anticipate an interactive session that not only entertains but also equips them with tangible skills to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of professional speaking and authorship.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are excited to host our own Dr. Candy Campbell and offer speakers and authors a unique opportunity to explore the intersection of creativity and effective communication, &#8221; said Irvine Nugent, past DC Chapter President, who will emcee the event.  &#8220;Her interactive keynote promises to be a catalyst for innovation, providing valuable insights that can elevate the impact of their words and stories, which we will highlight directly after, in a story competition. &#8220;<\/p>\n<p>This interactive keynote is expected to draw professionals from the speaking and authorship communities, creating a forum for cross-disciplinary collaboration and idea exchange. Dr. Candy Campbell&#8217;s engaging style and proven expertise in applied improvisation make this event essential for anyone seeking to enhance their skills and resonate more profoundly with their audience. <\/p>\n<p>The meeting is open to all.
