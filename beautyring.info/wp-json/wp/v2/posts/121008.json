As part of the  ESA Spark Funding program, the company received support for the development  of a device that uses a new, specially designed coldplasma  to provide an effective and sustainable treatment of acne  and other skin diseases and irritations. <\/p>\n<p>Acne &#8211; widespread skin condition of youth<\/p>\n<p>With a probability of occurrence of almost 100 percent, acne is the number one skin infection in adolescence and puberty. While a majority  of 60  percent  of  cases are mild acne that can be treated with non-prescription drugs, the remaining 40 percent are  acute or even chronic cases that require medical attention. The latter type of acne often presents a therapeutic challenge, as it is associated with acute lesions (destroyed cell tissue), severe inflammation and rapid scarring. In addition, patients with acne often suffer from low self-esteem, reduced quality of life and depression. <\/p>\n<p>Cost factor acne-prone skin<\/p>\n<p>In addition to this dermatological and psychological burden, acne also puts a financial strain on patients. An individual acne treatment (this only includes acne products but no professional medical care) costs about \u20ac 1,000 per year. On the other hand, the costs charged to the healthcare provider average \u20ac690 (up to \u20ac870) per acute acne period, including inpatient stays, outpatient services, emergency care and pharmacy costs during the episode.<\/p>\n<p>Cold plasma against hard-to-reach acne bacteria<\/p>\n<p>Acne infections are mainly caused by the anaerobic bacterium Cutibacterium acnes. Therefore, the device developed by terraplasma will produce cold plasma, which is able to efficiently inactivate these bacteria, which are mainly found in follicles and pores (and are therefore difficult to reach with creams and liquids), without damaging the surrounding healthy tissues. <\/p>\n<p>Cold plasma makes the skin open to creams, medications and healing<\/p>\n<p>Another goal is to design the cold plasma in such a way that it improves the absorption of antibacterial creams and liquids and is effective against other skin diseases and irritations.    Initial preliminary investigations have shown very positive results when using cold plasma on the skin: on the one hand, the cold plasma ensures that the regeneration of the skin cells is stimulated and, on the other hand, the skin pores are opened \u2013 this means that creams, but also externally administered medications can be better absorbed. <\/p>\n<p>Ambitious goals with successful signs<\/p>\n<p>In order to achieve all these goals, terraplasma will build  on  the extensive practical knowledge already gained by the company in the development of the successful  plasma care<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> (medical device class IIa) for professional wound treatment and plasma derma care<sup>\u00ae<\/sup><sup>\u00ae<\/sup>  &#8211; (medical device  Class I) for the professional treatment of skin diseases. <\/p>\n<p>As part of the funding program, the new device from terraplasma (working title tpSkin) will be developed primarily for use by end users with the following core properties:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tTransferable: no cables or hoses and battery operation with charging by induction<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tPractical: small, handy and can be used in one-handed operation<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tSimple: uncomplicated operation by medical laymen possible<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tkompakt: Use of new low-line plasma source based on SMD (Surface Micro-Discharge) technology<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tInnovative: newly developed, bactericidal plasma, which is gentle on the tissue in addition to combating acne and improves cream absorption<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tTenable: only air and electricity are needed for plasma production<\/p>\n<p>Terraplasma is confident that it will be able to intensively test the new device with the first prototypes at the end of the year as part of this funding program. Special attention is also paid to the compact size and cost of the device, which should be convincing in commercial form \u2013 terraplasma is still looking for a partner for marketing \u2013 not only because of its effectiveness. <\/p>\n<p>About terraplasma<\/p>\n<p>The terraplasma GmbH (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.terraplasma.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.terraplasma.com<\/a>), founded in 2011 as a spin-off of the Max Planck Society and based in Garching near Munich, offers innovative solutions for the development of cold plasma products in areas where germs are undesirable, odors or harmful molecules cause problems. Cold plasmas are partially ionized gases that inactivate bacteria, fungi, viruses, spores and odor molecules very efficiently. With different basic technologies, terraplasma cooperates with well-known companies in the fields of medical technology, hygiene, water treatment, odor management, air purification and surface modification. As a partner of industry, terraplasma&#8217;s goal is to develop and market needs-based cold plasma solutions together with its partners. A young team that works with a great deal of creativity and sophistication, many years of extensive know-how in the field of cold plasma technology and numerous patents from a wide variety of areas support the company on its road to success.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nPress contact: Florian Kreutz kreutz@terraplasma.com +49 89 95 45 769 23<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Florian Kreutz<br \/>terraplasma GmbH<br \/>+49 8995457690<br \/>info@terraplasma.com<br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/terraplasma\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/terraplasma\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/terraplasma-gmbh\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/terraplasma\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCtpMR0uBC7EGDiBUzjsVf1g\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@terraplasma?lang=de-DE\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">TikTok<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=UMxTAD5GyiEI-voi&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      May 12, 2023, 10:33 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/633303009\/cure-skin-sustainably-with-cold-plasma-and-be-effective-against-acne-tpskin-for-easy-support-of-skin-health\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
