After 15 years in corporate America, Tarris lost her central vision and eventually her six-figure career in a battle with Stargardt disease, a genetic condition that caused her legal blindness. In addition to being a novelist, Tarris is a screenwriter and actress who uses slivers of her life-experienced pie to create vivid characters and roller coaster journeys to inspire and entertain others. Tarris received a Bachelor of Science degree in marketing and business administration from Indiana University, where she also became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. She currently resides with her two children and husband in the great city of spaceships (Houston, TX). <\/p>\n<p>For more information, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tarrismarie.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.tarrismarie.com<\/a>, or connect with the author on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook at @tarrismarie.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon link: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Blaque-Pearle-Tarris-Marie\/dp\/B0BR4XNNCD\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Blaque-Pearle-Tarris-Marie\/dp\/B0BR4XNNCD\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Blaque Pearle<br \/>Publisher: Black Odyssey Media<br \/>Release Date: September 26, 2023<br \/>ISBN-13: \u200e979-8985594171 <br \/>Available from Amazon.com and everywhere books are sold<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Trish Stevens<br \/>Ascot Media Group, Inc.<br \/>+1 832-334-2733<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/659928986\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AscotMediaGroup\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AscotMediaGroup\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/trish-stevens-99728335\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=PXhLjQgEj4Dbd3jg&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      October 05, 2023, 18:36 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/659928986\/legally-blind-author-announces-debut-of-series-centered-on-flawed-but-fierce-black-women-in-america\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
