This season, five resorts will see new chairlifts (four of them high-speed), plus exciting new lift-served terrain at Keystone \u2013 all designed to help skiers and riders make the most out of every minute on the mountain. The projects will increase uphill capacity, giving guests more time to learn new skills, explore new terrain, and discover new peaks.<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>This season at <b>Keystone Resort<\/b>, for the very first time, guests will have lift access to Keystone&#8217;s high alpine, thanks to the installation of a brand-new, high-speed, 6-passenger chairlift in <b>Bergman Bowl<\/b>. The Bergman Express will provide lift access to more than 550 acres of intermediate-and-above-level high alpine terrain, including 16 new trails in Bergman and Erickson Bowls. In addition to offering an inviting high alpine adventure, Bergman Express will elevate the guest experience by improving skier and rider circulation across Keystone&#8217;s three mountain peaks.<\/li>\n<li><b><span class=\"xn-location\">Breckenridge<\/span> <\/b>continues the transformation of the Peak 8 Base Area with the upgrade of 5-Chair to a new, high-speed quad \u2013 the FIVE SuperChair. With this lift upgrade, all four chairlifts that service Peak 8 will now be high-speed to assist with improved flow and circulation out of the resort&#8217;s most popular base area. The new investments will provide a clear path to progression on Peak 8, with Rip&#8217;s Ride servicing learning and beginner terrain, FIVE SuperChair servicing beginner and intermediate terrain, and the <span class=\"xn-location\">Colorado<\/span> and Rocky Mountain SuperChairs servicing intermediate and advanced terrain.<\/li>\n<li><b>Whistler Blackcomb&#8217;s<\/b> Fitzsimmons Express will be replaced with a high-speed, 8-person chairlift \u2013 the first of its kind across Vail Resorts&#8217; North American resorts. The upgrade will help reduce lift line wait times out of the base at Skier&#8217;s Plaza in <span class=\"xn-location\">Whistler Village<\/span>, increasing uphill capacity and improving circulation in the mid-mountain area.<\/li>\n<li>At <b>Stevens Pass, <\/b>the iconic Kehr&#8217;s Chair will be replaced with a new fixed grip quad ahead of the 2023\/24 season. The new chair brings modern upgrades and comfort while also increasing uphill capacity. Kehr&#8217;s Chair has historically provided access to advanced terrain off Big Chief Mountain, where guests can choose to take intermediate or advanced trails back to the base area or can continue to Double Diamond to access a diverse network of trails on the backside.<\/li>\n<li>At <b>Attitash Mountain Resort<\/b> in <span class=\"xn-location\">New Hampshire<\/span>, the much-anticipated Mountaineer, a high-speed, 4-passenger chairlift replacing the Summit Triple, will reduce ride time by more than half, increase uphill capacity and improve the flow of the Attitash base area.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>4. Skip the Ticket Line: Your Phone is Your Ticket to the Slopes.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>With Mobile Pass &amp; Mobile Lift Ticket on the new <i>My Epic<\/i> app coming to guests this fall, your phone is your ticket to the slopes. Mobile Pass &amp; Mobile Lift Ticket will be available for the 2023\/24 winter season at all Vail Resorts&#8217; U.S. resorts, with availability at Whistler Blackcomb to follow in future seasons. The new technology will allow guests to buy their pass or lift ticket online, activate and store it on their phone in the new <i>My Epic<\/i> app, put their phone in their pocket, and get scanned, hands free, via Bluetooth\u00ae technology designed for low energy usage.<\/p>\n<p>This will reduce the need to visit the ticket window or wait to receive a pass or lift ticket in the mail. In support of the company&#8217;s Commitment to Zero sustainability commitment, this change over time will also reduce the waste created by plastic cards and RFID chips.<br class=\"dnr\">\u00a0<br class=\"dnr\">Plastic cards will continue to be available to any guests who cannot or do not want to use their phone as their pass or lift ticket. Plastic cards will continue to be used at Whistler Blackcomb, as Mobile Pass will not be available at the resort during the 2023\/24 season. The company will also activate the plastic cards of renewing Pass Holders and mail plastic cards to all new guests for the 2023\/24 season, as part of the transition to Mobile Pass &amp; Mobile Lift Ticket.
