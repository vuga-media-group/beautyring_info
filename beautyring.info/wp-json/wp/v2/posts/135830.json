As part of the series, HHEC, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.36chambers.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">36 Chambers ALC<\/a>, will present a special screening of the new documentary &#8220;<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=k9ZDkKUo4Ao\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">A Wu-Tang Experience: Live at Red Rocks Amphitheatre<\/a>&#8221; on Wednesday, November 15 at 7:00pm. Lincoln Center\u2019s Chief Education Officer, Lee Bynum, will moderate an insightful post screening discussion with RZA, Wu-Tang Clan founder and co-director of the film, co-director and producer Gerald K. Barclay of Gee-Bee Productions, and HHEC Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Martha Diaz.<\/p>\n<p>The event will also commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Wu-Tang Clan&#8217;s seminal debut album &#8220;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers),\u201d which revolutionized Hip-Hop upon its release on November 9, 1993. As part of the event, City Hall will present a proclamation officially declaring November 9 as \u201cWu-Tang Clan Day\u201d in NYC. The night will also honor the memory of founding Wu-Tang Clan member Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard aka ODB (Russell Tyrone Jones), born on November 15, 1968, on what would have been his 55th birthday. Councilmember Chi Oss\u00e9, Chair of the Cultural Affairs, Libraries, and International Intergroup Relations Committee, will be on hand to present ODB\u2019s family with a council resolution, expected to come up for vote in early November, that will designate November 15 as \u201cOl\u2019 Dirty Bastard Day\u201d in NYC.<\/p>\n<p>Combining performances and revealing interviews with group members and associates, classical musicians, and concertgoers, the film documents the extraordinary concert at the iconic Red Rocks Amphitheatre where the Wu-Tang Clan, backed by the 60-piece Colorado Symphony Orchestra, weaved together songs from their vast discography of group and solo albums. Their setlist created a live score to a real-time screening of the seminal martial arts film The 36th Chamber of Shaolin\u2014the movie that largely inspired the Clan\u2019s aesthetic and the title of their groundbreaking debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers).<\/p>\n<p>The documentary deconstructs stereotypes that limit classical music and Hip-Hop as mutually exclusive musical genres, dismantles these imposed limitations, and collapses boundaries and artistic mediums to amplify the ways classical music, Hip-Hop, and film can coalesce in a beautiful, innovative union.<\/p>\n<p>Adjacent to the theater, in the Furman Gallery, there will be an exhibit specially curated for the evening. Meaningfully titled \u201cTranscendence,\u201d the exhibit features work by former graffiti writers, street artists, and documentarians, inviting audiences to traverse the synchronous journey of Hip-Hop music and art as it scaled beyond all expectations, shattering cultural norms and perspectives for generations to come. \u201cTranscendence\u201d is inspired by the release of Gerald K. Barclay\u2019s memoir, \u201cShooting The Clan: Eyewitness To The Rise Of The Wu-Tang Clan.\u201d The exhibit proudly features never-before-seen archival footage of Wu-Tang Clan by Barclay, a life-sized portrait of late, beloved Clan member, ODB, and dynamic works by New York-based artists\u2014all commemorating the triumph of Hip-Hop&#8217;s 50th anniversary.<\/p>\n<p>Following the event, there will be a private reception sponsored by Le Kool Champagne, Vuelo Tequila, Kakes NYC and Killah Koffee.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about the event, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.LincolnCenter.org\/WuTang\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.LincolnCenter.org\/WuTang<\/a><\/p>\n<p>About Hip-Hop Education Center<br \/>The mission of the Hip-Hop Education Center is to catalyze social change and equity through transnational research, curated curricula, collaborative programming, career and leadership development, and an archive of Hip-Hop education and culture. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.hiphopeducation.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.hiphopeducation.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p>About 36 Chambers ALC<br \/>36 Chambers ALC stands as a record label and lifestyle company, brought to life by the vision of RZA, founder of the legendary Wu-Tang Clan.
