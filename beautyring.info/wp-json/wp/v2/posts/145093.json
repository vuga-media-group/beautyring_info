Moreover, the same segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 5.5% from 2021 to 2030. This is attributed to reformate process being one of the major production process by which aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene and toluene are produced.<\/p>\n<p>The drugs segment to maintain its lead position during the forecast period<br \/>Based on end use, the drugs segment accounted for the largest share in 2020, contributing to more than two-fifths of the global toluene market, and is projected to maintain its lead position during the forecast period. This is due to the increasing severity of diseases in the pharmaceutical sector where toluene is widely used as an intermediate for producing central nervous system (CNS) depressant drugs. However, the blending segment is expected to portray the largest CAGR of 5.7% from 2021 to 2030. The increasing rural &amp; commercial housing demand and increasing sales of automobile has surged the growth of the paints &amp; coatings sector where blended toluene is widely used for producing paints, paint thinners, and lacquers. This factor boosts the growth of the toluene market for blending applications.<\/p>\n<p>Interested in Procuring This Report?
