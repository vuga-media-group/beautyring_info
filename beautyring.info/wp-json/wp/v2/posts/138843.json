He wanted to know where the questions came from; who got the prizes; who came up with the ideas for the games; who picked the contestants; how the celebrities came up with those funny answers; how much that wheel weighed; how the host became the host. He now spends his adulthood collecting the answers to those questions, and turning them into 11 books about the history, and making, of TV game shows.<\/p>\n<p>Already an unlikely choice of career, it began in equally unlikely circumstances: Nedeff served as Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s tour guide on a visit to Madame Tussaud\u2019s Hollywood for a segment of the comic\u2019s TBS show. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI already had a secret desire to write a book,\u201d explains Nedeff, \u201cjust to prove to myself that I could. Two things happened during that segment\u2014I got to strike up a conversation with Conan O\u2019Brien about my obsession with game shows, and I actually said, out loud, \u2018I\u2019d like to write a book someday.\u2019 And that\u2019s something everybody says. \u2018I\u2019d like to write a book someday\u2019 is the mating call of the guy with no sense of direction to his life. And I realized, now, since I had said it out loud, that meant I\u2019d better do it, or else I\u2019m just another guy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI also got 15 minutes of fame from being on the show. Fans would take photos with me at Madame Tussaud\u2019s. And I decided I\u2019d better jump on that. I used the 15 minutes of fame to make contact with the folks at BearManor Media and promote myself, and that got the ball rolling.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nedeff has since authored 11 books, including:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; \u201cThis Day in Game Show History\u201d<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n-\u201cQuizmaster: The Life and Times and Fun and Games of Bill Cullen\u201d<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n-\u201cThe Matchless Gene Rayburn\u201d<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n-\u201cGame Shows FAQ\u201d<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n-\u201cOkay? Okay! Dennis James\u2019 Lifetime of Firsts\u201d<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n-\u201cIt\u2019s More Than Password! The Life (and Wife) of Allen Ludden\u201d<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n-\u201cMonty Hall: TV\u2019s Big Dealer\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s More Than Password!,\u201d his biography of Betty White\u2019s husband who hosted the long-running \u201cPassword,\u201d received what Nedeff calls \u201cthe ultimate endorsement.\u201d In the last photo of Betty White posted on social media, a copy of the book is visible in front of the actress, on her coffee table.<\/p>\n<p>His newest release is \u201cGong This Book,\u201d a history of \u201cThe Gong Show\u201d and a look at the life and career of its eccentric creator\/host, Chuck Barris. Nedeff spoke to a number of Barris\u2019 employees, all of whom shared warm memories of a boss that they remembered as generous and kind. Even though he had a job to do, Nedeff made it a point to thank his interviewees for their role in the shows he watched so devoutly as a child.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI love game shows,\u201d says Nedeff, \u201cand the best part is, I guess, they love me back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nedeff has since left the wax museum life and works behind-the-scenes on game shows. He\u2019s served as a question researcher for over a dozen game shows, including \u201cDouble Dare,\u201d \u201cMaster Minds,\u201d \u201cSplit Second,\u201d and \u201cCollege Bowl.\u201d He is also a researcher and archivist for the National Archives of Game Show History, a wing of the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York. In this role, Nedeff helps catalog and gather props, set pieces, photographs, and other memorabilia from game shows past, and produces the museum\u2019s series of oral histories with noteworthy figures from TV game shows.<\/p>\n<p>Nedeff says, \u201cThere\u2019s some truth to the memes on social media. When you see a picture of Bob Barker next to a picture of chicken noodle soup and somebody is posting about their sick days out of school, there\u2019s really something to be said there about the fact that people depend on game shows for just a small bit of comfort during a rough time. It\u2019s a chance for people to escape from whatever else is going on in the world, forget their troubles, and watch somebody win the car, the cash, and the washer\/dryer. And if they happen to get a self-confidence boost for a few minutes because they solved the puzzle or blurted out the correct answer before the contestants on the screen, that\u2019s a bonus.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The prize money on game shows has opened new doors for the winners. William Peter Blatty lived off the $10,000 in cash he won on \u201cYou Bet Your Life\u201d while he wrote a novel\u2014&#8221;The Exorcist.\u201d Kirstie Alley was a big winner on &#8220;Match Game&#8221; shortly before her acting career took off. Paul Reubens, a\/k\/a Pee-Wee Herman, credited his payday from \u201cThe Gong Show\u201d with keeping him afloat financially as he developed his act in theatre productions.<\/p>\n<p>Game shows also provide, as Nedeff likes to say, \u201crecreational education.\u201d People remember the tidbits that they hear on game shows. Nedeff says, \u201cThere\u2019s a story that a family survived a tornado by gathering together in their bathtub, and the reason they got in the bathtub during a tornado is because one of them remembered hearing a question about that in \u2018Hollywood Squares.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nedeff says, \u201cI was once a passenger in an Uber and the driver saw me wearing a \u2018Wheel of Fortune\u2019 pin. He told me the story of moving to the U.S. in the 1980s and watching \u2018Wheel\u2019 twice a day, because it helped him learn what the letters of the alphabet were called and hearing the solution to the puzzle helped him learn how those letters sounded when they were turned into words. There\u2019s a wonderful extra benefit to that kind of light entertainment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Ben Ohmart<br \/>BearManor Media<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/674125815\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/authoradamnedeff\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/adam-nedeff-43a1805a\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=38DlBCD0DdwRdvOx&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      December 11, 2023, 03:37 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/674125815\/author-doesn-t-play-around-when-it-comes-to-the-history-of-game-shows\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
