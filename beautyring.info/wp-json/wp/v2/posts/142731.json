This year, the festival focuses on several key commemorations and offers a deep dive into the history and contemporary experiences of the Caribbean and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>Three films in <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bhm2024.eventive.org\/films\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">ADIFF Black History Month program<\/a> commemorate important moments and personalities: Produced by Rwandan filmmaker Eric Kabera in 2001, 100 Days by Nick Hughes was the first feature film made about the 1994 genocide that took place 30 years ago this year. To commemorate the 80th anniversary of Jacques Roumain\u2019s passing, ADIFF presents Jacques Roumain: Passion for a Country by Arnold Antonin, a documentary celebrating the influential Haitian writer and activist. This year marks the centennial birth of James Baldwin. I Heard It Through the Grapevine is an incisive 1982 documentary by Pat Hartley &amp; Dick Fontaine that follows the writer as he retraces his time in the South during the Civil Rights Movement, reflecting with his trademark brilliance and insight on the passage of more than two decades.  <\/p>\n<p>The range and impact of the African American experience is explored through Fighting for Respect: African American in WWI by Joanne Burke a documentary that delves into the cultural and social struggles within the African American community.  Mr. Emancipation: The Walter Perry Story celebrates the life of a notable figure in Canadian history and their impact on the Emancipation Day celebrations.<\/p>\n<p>Spotlighting <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bhm2024.eventive.org\/films?filterTags%5B65b27350b78d2200335970a1%5D=true\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Caribbean History<\/a> is a double feature with Catch a Fire by Menelik Shabazz \u2013 one of the pioneers of Black British cinema &#8211; that explores Paul Bogle&#8217;s revolutionary spirit and legacy in Jamaica, and Barrow: Freedom Fighter by Marcia Weekes about Errol Barrow&#8217;s journey to Barbadian independence. Additionally, the award-winning Walter Rodney: What They Don&#8217;t Want You to Know by Daniyal Harris-Vajda and Arlen Harris uncovers Cold War conspiracies and the fight for justice. This film is in the program courtesy of The Walter Rodney Foundation and the Ameena Gafoor Institute.<\/p>\n<p>It is in 1888 that Brazil abolished slavery. 100 years later, Afro-Brazilian director Zozimo Bulbul made Abolicao, a historical documentary that reflects on the abolition movement in Brazil and brings to light the pivotal moments of Brazilian history and its impact on the African Diaspora. The Esmeraldas Beach by Patrice Rayna is a powerful documentary that sets out to expose the invisibility of Afro-Ecuadorians and rectify the narrative of the country\u2019s history.<\/p>\n<p>ADIFF brings to the program two restored copies of two African classics: Sambizanga by Sarah Maldoror is a revolutionary fiction film that chronicles the awakening of Angola\u2019s independence movement and Shaihu Umar by Adamu Halilu, a story of African slavery, Islam and the power of family ties based on the novel of the same name by Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, first Prime Minister of Nigeria, himself the son of a slave.<\/p>\n<p>These selections not only honor the history of Africa and the African Diaspora but also showcase the diverse and dynamic stories that define a global community. ADIFF is committed to illuminating these narratives through cinema, fostering a greater understanding and appreciation of black history and culture. <\/p>\n<p>For more information about the ADIFF Black History Month, please e-mail pr@nyadiff.org.

Through robust programming that gives meaning to the word &#8220;diverse,&#8221; the selections in this year&#8217;s festival illuminate the experiences of those living in the African diaspora around the world.  The New York-based husband-and-wife programmers, Reinaldo Barroso-Spech and Diarah N&#8217;Daw-Spech, have chosen more than a dozen films that, through a variety of modes and genres, further dimensionalize already complex issues specific to those living in these communities. Naturally, documentary lends itself to this mission, though several narrative features and a short fiction add to the plenitude of information.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Diarah N&#8217;Daw-Spech<br \/>ArtMattan Films<br \/>+1 212-864-1760<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/686516586\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Black History Month Promo Trailer<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"rQWXIEIgRTc\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"ADIFF New York Presents: Black History Month HM 2024\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rQWXIEIgRTc?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=_cCIE44rhnp94--p&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      February 06, 2024, 18:22 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/686516586\/african-diaspora-international-film-festival-celebrates-black-history-month-with-a-global-perspective-february-23-25\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
