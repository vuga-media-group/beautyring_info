Through his evaluation, Ryan aims to ignite audiences\u2019 appreciation for a bygone era when films held the power to deeply impact lives.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cArguing about films in a video store was our Twitter. It was real, passionate, and it sometimes changed our minds,\u201d Ryan says. With a keen eye for detail, Ryan covers a decade that commenced with classics like \u201cGoodFellas\u201d and concluded with the enigmatic \u201cMagnolia.\u201d Among the featured films are beloved titles such as \u201cMalcolm X,\u201d \u201cBefore Sunrise,\u201d and \u201cClueless,\u201d each contributing to nineties cinema culture.<\/p>\n<p>Drawing from his years working as a video store clerk in a small Ohio town, Ryan fills his analysis with real world experience. \u201cThe Last Decade of Cinema\u201d showcases twenty-five diverse films, including \u201cPretty Woman,\u201d \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d \u201cMenace II Society,\u201d \u201cThe Prince of Tides,\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>Showcasing the bold creativity of filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino, Amy Heckerling, Spike Lee, Robert Altman, and Paul Thomas Anderson, the book also includes interviews with Patricia Arquette and Alexander Payne. Scott Ryan\u2019s signature blend of humor and smart observation illuminates what made these films endure and why they\u2019re still relevant in today\u2019s cinematic landscape.<\/p>\n<p>Screenwriter Helen Childress, known for her work on \u201cReality Bites,\u201d reflects on Ryan\u2019s book. \u201cI feel like Scott Ryan could have written this directly to me and others in our generation who have basically \u2018given up\u2019 on movies. It is at once tribute and eulogy, so bittersweet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ryan emphasizes the importance of preserving the art of cinema for audiences. \u201cIf we let art slip out of the hands of grown-ups and only create movies for children and teenagers, the human experience in film will be gone for good.\u201d He encourages readers to immerse themselves in the complexity of cinematic narratives, advocating for the transformative power of film to inspire and enlighten.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Last Decade of Cinema\u201d is aimed at veteran cinephiles and newcomers alike, offering insightful commentary while acknowledging a highly influential era in modern cinematic history.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT SCOTT RYAN\u202f <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nScott Ryan, a multifaceted author, publisher, and television historian, is a pop culture and entertainment industry expert. With a portfolio that spans oral histories, behind-the-scenes stories and critical exploration of film and television, his latest book, \u201cThe Last Decade of Cinema\u201d, explores fifty-five movies from the nineties, offering an analysis of their impact on pop culture both at the time of their release and their lasting significance today.\u202fRyan\u2019s previous works include \u201cMoonlighting: An Oral History\u201d, where he unveils the untold story behind the groundbreaking TV series, and \u201cthirtysomething at thirty: an oral history\u201d, alongside \u201cThe Last Days of Letterman\u201d, which chronicles the end of an era in late-night television. In \u201cScott Luck Stories\u201d, he ventures into the realm of comic short stories, showcasing his unique blend of wry humor and journalistic acumen. As the managing editor of \u201cThe Blue Rose Magazine\u201d and co-founder of Fayetteville Mafia Press, Ryan has solidified his position as a raw and honest pop culture storyteller.\u202f He is the co-host of \u201cTiger Talk\u201d on YouTube which follows the Massillon Tigers high school football team. He also co-wrote a book about the Tigers\u2019 state championship win in 2023 called \u201cMassillon Against the World.\u201d With all this, it still burns him that he never won Employee of the Month at Video Time where he learned to love film by stealing VHS tapes and movie posters.
