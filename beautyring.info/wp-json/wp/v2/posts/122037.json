As a result, premiumization play a key role in the overall luxury perfume market growth. Today\u2019s customer seek for superior quality and content when it comes to using any kind of consumer good products including perfumes irrespective of its high end price tags. This results in increase in demand for premium brand perfumes.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the developed countries have witnessed surging demand for luxury perfume products. For instance, as per the sources, the UK premium fragrance revenue sales increased by nearly 8.0% in 2016. However, the overall fragrance market of the country saw a decline by 2.5%. This is attributable to the rise in per capita income of target customers coupled with extended product offerings of luxury perfume manufacturers. Thus surge in demand for various fragrance products triggers growth of the market.<\/p>\n<p>According to International Fragrance Association, artisanal and niche fragrances are the fastest growing segment of the fragrance segment. The significant growth of the segment is attributable to the fact that majority of target customers seek for natural or organic products for its consumption. Artisanal perfumes are processed with natural and exotic ingredients instead of synthetic elements. They are usually produced in smaller quantities and not distributed widely but sold through limited retail formats. Taking this customer buying behavior into consideration, most of the key players in the global luxury perfume market have been strategizing on acquiring several key artisanal perfume manufacturers. For instance, in 2015, Japan based Shiseido purchased independent perfumer Serge Lutens. Similarly, in 2016, L\u2019Or\u00e9al acquired Atelier Cologne. Key mergers and acquisitions initiated by manufacturers expected to drive the growth of the market during the luxury perfume market forecast.<\/p>\n<p>REQUEST FOR CUSTOMIZATION :- <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/request-for-customization\/6189\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/request-for-customization\/6189<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Celebrity fragrance is another segment contributing to the growth of the global luxury perfume market analysis.
