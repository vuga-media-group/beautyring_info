We are excited to introduce author and weather anchor Guy Brown\u2019s second book, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.platypusmedia.com\/product-page\/how-cats-say-i-love-you\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">How Cats Say I Love You<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Cats are more than just cuddly critters: they also get nervous, hyper, relaxed, lazy, or angry\u2014just like us! It falls on us to discover what our furry friends are trying to communicate: are they playfully chirping or peacefully purring? Is their tail wrapped around your legs or tucked between their own? Maybe they need some time alone, or maybe they\u2019re hungry for a treat! Featuring a diverse cast of children and a colorful range of cats from all around the world, this book teaches young readers about all the ways their friends\u2014human and feline alike\u2014share their feelings. <\/p>\n<p>In a world where primary education is increasingly online, away from busy classrooms and social problem-solving, learning empathy is more important than ever. Best for readers ages 2-7, How Cats Say I Love You shows young kids how both humans and felines communicate their emotions. This picture book teaches kids to pay attention to the social cues around them. By recognizing when their cat is angry and learning how to respond to their needs, kids will be empowered to apply those new skills to their friends and family.<\/p>\n<p>Janan Cain, author of the bestselling books The Way I Feel and The Way I Feel Too, calls this social-emotional learning read \u201cA fun and engaging book with lively illustrations\u201d that \u201cteaches young children to explore emotions and communication with the help of cats from around the world. A valuable resource for teachers and parents alike.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even when a character is sad, angry, or overstimulated, the illustrations by Davide Ortu maintain a warm, cheerful palette throughout the book. This tells readers that all emotions are okay to feel; sometimes you just need time alone or to take a break. The fuzzy linework and textured swathes of color are inviting to readers both young and old. The diverse cast of characters allows children of many different nationalities to identify with the story or find their own household cats on the pages. <\/p>\n<p>Beyond the lively illustrations, parents, librarians, and educators will love this book because of how it helps fuel children\u2019s observations of the world around them and can inform their interactions with family members, friends, and peers. How Cats Say I Love You is a great way to ignite a conversation between a child and their caregiver about understanding and respecting physical and emotional boundaries. Above all, this book gives examples of healthy ways to communicate and respond to social stimuli. <\/p>\n<p>Author and TV meteorologist Guy Brown can be seen forecasting the weather on-air today in the Big Apple, New York City. Previously, he spent several years as a weather anchor in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area of Minnesota. He enjoys volunteering at local elementary schools, where he shares his passion for meteorology with children.
