This is reflected in the company&#8217;s approach toward refurbishment and resource conservation.<\/p>\n<p>During the reporting period,\u00a0Atour\u00a0launched two new products, <span class=\"xn-person\">Atour Light<\/span> 3.0 and Atour 4.0 &#8220;With Nature,&#8221; a midscale hotel offering and an upper midscale variation. They underwent refurbishment using modular designs, with modular elements accounting for over 90% and 80% of the overall designs, respectively. This initiative significantly reduces maintenance costs and non-essential construction waste.<\/p>\n<p>Sustainability practices extend beyond decoration. Atour hotels now are equipped with less carbon-intensive amenities, such as 100% biodegradable paper cups, as well as\u00a0natural\u00a0cotton beddings and\u00a0natural bamboo paper products\u00a0manufactured without bleach or fluorescents, easing the burden on the environment.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Atour promotes water conservation across its some 1,210 hotels (as of the end of last year) using the dedicated-loop system for circulating hot water, resulting in a reduction of 12.67 tons of water consumption per room annually.<\/p>\n<p>Atour prioritizes customer experience, introducing innovations from Atour APLUS services to Late Night Congee to ensure customers feel at home during their stays. Customers can expect a carefree experience and peace of mind, thanks to Atour&#8217;s commitment to purified indoor air, fire safety, cleanliness, hygiene, and strict user privacy protection.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Atour has reinforced its support for franchisees through its &#8220;Six Commitments to Franchisees&#8221; and &#8220;Eight Supply Chain Procurement Commitments,&#8221; empowering them\u00a0with a responsible supply network, rights guarantees, as well as training on sustainability. For instance, the company vows to address franchisees&#8217; complaints within 48 hours and refund price differences\/offer refunds.<\/p>\n<p>Originating from Yaduo, a remote village in southwestern <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span>, Atour has consistently given back to its place of inspiration by encouraging local villagers to grow tea, fueling economic development and rural revitalization.<\/p>\n<p>As the report indicates, Atour purchased a cumulative 150 tons of processed tea leaves worth\/for <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB 37 million<\/span> from the villagers, benefiting some 1,400 households. As part of its charitable engagements, it also donated a batch of clothes with a value of around <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB 2 million<\/span> to the needy and supported targeted poverty alleviation efforts.<\/p>\n<p>In urban areas, Atour contributes to societal well-being by offering resting places in its <span class=\"xn-location\">Shanghai<\/span> headquarters\u00a0for frontline workers such as couriers, delivery rider, and sanitation workers\u00a0during their downtime.<\/p>\n<p>Ten years after its birth, Atour prides itself on creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace for its employees. Currently, over 58% of its 4,248 employees are female, and the company employs 17 people with physical disabilities and 162 members of ethnic minorities.<\/p>\n<p>On the corporate governance front, Atour has established an ESG working group tasked to report directly to its Executive Committee. The ultimate goal is to implement a coherent sustainability strategy throughout its corporate hierarchy, thereby embedding ESG concepts into Atour&#8217;s mission and core values.<\/p>\n<p>Recognizing board diversity as a pillar for sustained growth, Atour aims to include factors like one&#8217;s gender, age, culture and professional background when nominating future board members. Currently, there are three independent directors and two female directors on the eight-member board.<\/p>\n<p>In aligning with its strategic vision to boast a network of 2,000 premier hotels by 2025 and deliver the optimum &#8220;Chinese experience,&#8221; Atour is set to invest more resources and energies in the realm of ESG.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Looking ahead, we aim to enhance our sustainable development initiatives and capacities consistently, turning our original aspirations of warmth and generosity into increased resilience through concrete measures,&#8221; said Mr. <span class=\"xn-person\">Haijun Wang<\/span>, founder and CEO of Atour.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We remain committed to creating an intimate ambience where people can warmly connect and contributing to a greener ecology and a kinder, more compassionate society.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>About Atour Lifestyle Holdings Limited<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Atour Lifestyle Holdings Limited (NASDAQ: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ticket-symbol\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#financial-modal\">ATAT<\/a>) is a leading hospitality and lifestyle company in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span>, with a distinct portfolio of lifestyle hotel brands.
