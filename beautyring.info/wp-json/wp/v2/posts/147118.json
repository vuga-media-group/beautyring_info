But ten years later, less than thirty individuals are left in the wild. &#8216;Lemon and Cedar&#8217; draws attention to the plight of these beautiful animals, and prompts child readers to get to know more about this critically endangered species whose range once encompassed the whole of the southeastern US. <\/p>\n<p>Cedar, a red wolf, lives in the Alligator National Wildlife Refuge, a protected area of land on the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula in North Carolina. This area is the only safe haven for wild red wolves, which often fall victim to vehicular accidents or are killed by farmers who mistake them for nuisance coyotes.<\/p>\n<p>But Cedar yearns to explore the world outside the Refuge\u2014and to find out if there are other red wolves somewhere out there. Accompanied by his friend Lemon, a cottontail rabbit with a daredevil\u2019s penchant for adventure\u2014as her willingness to be friends with a wolf can attest\u2014Cedar sets off on an epic journey to find others like him. Along the way, the pair will encounter other animals both friendly and hostile, and will have to work together to continue their journey safely. But as they travel, one question lingers: if Cedar does find other red wolves, what will happen to the pair\u2019s unusual friendship?<\/p>\n<p>Richly and realistically illustrated with vivid oil paints that faithfully capture the spirit of the many animals within its pages, &#8216;Lemon and Cedar&#8217; is scheduled for release on April 2, 2024.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Cedar the red wolf has always wondered if there are other red wolves like him in the wild. So when a plucky cottontail rabbit named Lemon stumbles into his clearing and takes him up on his offer for an adventure, an unlikely friendship is formed as the pair embark on a journey, leaving their home at the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge for the first time. Along the way, Lemon and Cedar meet a seabird on the sandy beaches of the Outer Banks; discover large, winged predators while traveling through a swamp; and have a close call with a four-legged foe in a cornfield. Despite the obstacles they face, Cedar and Lemon persist on their quest, searching for red wolves and finding friendship along their way to the Great Dismal Swamp.<\/p>\n<p>Conservation of wildlife is important. Ten percent of the author\u2019s proceeds will be donated to the Red Wolf Coalition.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;About the Author&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Christel Dyer developed a passion for books and the environment early, as a child growing up in coastal Virginia. She now lives in Chesapeake, Virginia, where she works in the public sector as a wastewater engineer and scientist and spends her free time advocating for sustainability and the environment.<\/p>\n<p>After learning about red wolves and how few remain in the wild, Christel decided to try her hand at writing a children\u2019s book. She hopes &#8216;Lemon and Cedar&#8217; will excite children to protect the Earth and the species that populate it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;About the Illustrator&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Eric Freeberg has illustrated over twenty-five books for children, including &#8216;The Wizard of Oz,&#8217; &#8216;Greek Myths,&#8217; and &#8216;Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales.&#8217; He was the winner of the London Book Fair\u2019s International Children\u2019s Illustration Competition, the Holbein Prize for Fantasy Art, and the Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation Award; and was also the runner-up winner of the SCBWI Magazine Merit Award, as well as the winner of an honorable mention in the SCBWI Don Freeman International Portfolio Competition and the second-place winner in the Clymer Museum\u2019s Annual Illustration Invitational.
