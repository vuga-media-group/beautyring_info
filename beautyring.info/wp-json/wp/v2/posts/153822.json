Sometimes beautiful, sometimes brutal, the prose is always thoroughly engrossing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Reader Views wrote, \u201cIf Ernest Hemingway was black, gay, and writing about growing up in the [1960s], he would have written something like Leonce Gaiter\u2019s \u201cA Memory of Fictions (or) Just Tiddy-Boom.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>More personal than his previous work, \u201cA Memory of Fictions (or) Just Tiddy-Boom\u201d plays with the nexus of memory and make believe. \u201cI can\u2019t even tell where the facts of my life end and my perceptions of those facts distort them to the level of fiction. With this book, I stopped pretending I could tell the difference. It\u2019s part truth, part twisted truth, part complete fancy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The focus on the black, \u201cstriver\u201d middle-class of the 1960s is also a unique aspect of the novel. \u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly valuable to look at this black bourgeois class to understand some of what you\u2019re seeing today. A significant aspect of the backlash you see now comes from a racist reaction to the striver\u2019s dream\u2014African-Americans firmly in the seats of American power. A president, for instance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gaiter\u2019s other novels have also met with acclaim. \u201cI Dreamt I Was in Heaven \u2013 The Rampage of the Rufus Buck Gang,\u201d is a historical novel based on a shocking, little known episode in American history. Harvard Magazine noted, \u201cThe novel\u2019s raw, unvarnished portrait of the Old West sounds and feels both grittier and more real than the place frequently seen in Hollywood Westerns and on television.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>Dick Adler of The Chicago Tribune praised his noir, \u201cBourbon Street, comparing it to the works of James Sallis, Dick Lochte and James Lee Burke. Now comes a debut book by Leonce Gaiter,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat deserves a place on that map.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.leoncegaiter.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Author information<\/a>: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.leoncegaiter.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.leoncegaiter.com\/<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFor review copies or interview requests, please contact info@buckrampage.com.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nLink to <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.leoncegaiter.com\/Press\/index.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">press information<\/a>: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.leoncegaiter.com\/Press\/index.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.leoncegaiter.com\/Press\/index.html<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Cait Longeer<br \/>Legba Books<br \/>+1 530-636-3581<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/720443701\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/@leonceg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">X<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=UaS60R_svwJb965n&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      June 18, 2024, 15:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/720443701\/part-memoir-part-fiction-new-novel-presents-a-jazzy-riff-on-race-sex\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
