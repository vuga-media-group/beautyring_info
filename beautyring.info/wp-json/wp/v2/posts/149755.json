In addition to providing respite for wounded warriors and families, the 6-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot multi-purpose space\u00a0PenFed Grand Lodge will impact warrior groups by delivering programs for post-traumatic stress counseling, job training, entrepreneurial training, and education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Willing Warriors has long valued its partnership with PenFed Credit Union and the PenFed Foundation, as well as our community partners,&#8221; said President and Co-founder of Willing Warriors, <span class=\"xn-person\">Shirley Dominick<\/span>. &#8220;Their support, whether through donations, sponsorships, or volunteering, has been instrumental in our journey. It demonstrates a deep commitment to caring for warriors and their family members. We are bringing life-changing stays and impactful programs to our military heroes, and we couldn&#8217;t have done it without your support. Thank you for standing with us!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In addition to PenFed Foundation&#8217;s support for the PenFed Grand Lodge, PenFed Credit Union donated <span class=\"xn-money\">$300,000<\/span> to Willing Warriors in 2021 to begin raising matching funds to make the lodge a reality.<\/p>\n<p>In 2018, the\u00a0PenFed Foundation donated\u00a0$300,000\u00a0to Willing Warriors to build the PenFed Foundation Home at Warrior Retreat. The 5-bedroom PenFed Foundation Home doubled the capacity at Warrior Retreat, enabling Willing Warriors to provide respite after long hospital stays for 300 wounded warriors and their families per year.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>During their visits to the PenFed Foundation Home, recovering warriors are able to participate in nearly 50 activities to heal their minds and bodies including massage therapy, canine support services, fishing, hiking, horseback riding, helicopter tours, and five-star meals prepared by the Visiting Chef Program (VCP). The VCP consists of local chefs and military chef teams from around the region, including the Presidential Food Service Team. The PenFed Foundation Home saves lives and relationships by giving hope to warriors and families.
