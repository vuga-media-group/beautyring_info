This directly impacted sales of cosmetic packaging manufacturing companies.<br \/>In addition, lack of manpower and raw materials restricted the supply of cosmetic packaging components.

This is due to factors such as increase in use of skin care products in emerging countries and rise in number of people suffering from various skin conditions. However, the makeup segment is expected to portray the largest CAGR of 5.6% from 2021 to 2030, owing to increased use of makeup products in emerging countries.<\/p>\n<p>Asia-Pacific to maintain its dominance by 2030<br \/>Based on region, Asia-Pacific held the highest market share in terms of revenue 2020, accounting for more than one-third of the global cosmetic packaging market.
