The visit marked the first time that Australia appeared on a map and the first time recorded in history that Aboriginal Australians met people from the outside world.<\/p>\n<p>In May 2000, an estimated 250,000 Australians walked across Sydney Harbour Bridge to voice their support for reconciliation. Three months later, on 9 August 2000, the small crew of the Duyfken replica set foot on the beach at the mouth of the Pennefather River and made their own gesture of reconciliation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c\u201cThrough Darkest Seas\u201d is a story of great ocean adventures and the realisation that the history of Australia and Indonesia was not quite as simple as we were taught,\u201d said author Graeme Cocks. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe book spans the development of the United Dutch East India Company (VOC), the world\u2019s first transnational company, and the events surrounding the 1606 voyage. Then the contemporary story begins in 1994 when the idea of building a replica gained momentum in Fremantle.<\/p>\n<p>The book follows the story of the fund-raising and construction of the replica, setbacks and triumphs. In 2000, Duyfken and her modern crew sailed to Indonesia during the Timor Crisis and the exploding civil war in the outlying islands of the archipelago.<\/p>\n<p>The author offers a behind-the-scenes insight into the perseverance required to bring the project to fruition and the crazy idea of sailing the ship to Indonesia during a civil war and then across four oceans from Sydney to Europe in 2001\/2002.<\/p>\n<p>Graeme Cocks had a 20 year association with the Duyfken Project. He was a founding member of the Duyfken 1606 Replica Foundation in 1994 and Project Director of the Foundation for four years from 1999. He also served as Chair of the Foundation for a number of years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThrough Darkest Seas\u201d is on sale in Australia in paperback, hardcover and ebook on Amazon and at your favourite bookstore.
