The $41K grant was created to support female filmmakers who tell stories about women, especially women of color and accelerate racial, gender, and cultural diversity in creative spaces.  The initiative opens the doors for multicultural experiences to be shared through filmmaking, while emphasizing gender equality both in front of the camera and behind.  To enhance the experience, winners were contacted directly by Ericka Nicole Malone to encourage their filmmaking dreams, and offer words of wisdom.<\/p>\n<p>Ericka Nicole Malone is an award-winning producer, director, and writer with over 20 years of experience working in the entertainment industry.  She has witnessed firsthand the systematic bias and inequality faced by women of color in Hollywood, and for this reason her company ENME has awarded over $75K in grant funding to filmmakers of color in 2023. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cTelling our stories and navigating who works behind the camera below and above the line is a way as women we can effect change in this business.  We know when a woman of color creates a project there is a higher percentage of speaking parts for multicultural characters who are women,\u201d said Malone.  \u201cChanging statistics such as black women receiving less than .5% of venture capital funding is a priority for ENME, and the providing opportunities through the Power \u201cEN-ME\u201d Grant is my way of contributing to that change,\u201d she continued. <\/p>\n<p>The grant funds will be awarded to 13 women or non-binary creatives of color; seven, $5K grant winners and six, $1K honoree mentions.  In addition, awardees will receive a 30-minute one-on-one tactical session with Ericka. <\/p>\n<p>List of Grant Winners:<br \/>1.\t&#8220;Carte&#8221; by Rhym Guisse, ($5k grant) <br \/>2.\t\u201cLowest places, lost times\u201d by Bridgett Stephens (5k grant) <br \/>3.\t\u201cThe Lost League\u201d by Lydia Peterson (5k grant) <br \/>4.\t\u201cAging Out of Care Akilah\u2019s Story\u201d by Pamela Anderson (5k grant)<br \/>5.\t\u201cDisconnect\u201d by Dionne Wynn (5k grant)  <br \/>6.\t\u201cLA The Musical\u201d by Maya Lott (5k grant) <br \/>7.\t\u201cClosure\u201d by Danielle Ward (5k grant)<br \/>8.\t\u201cJust Us\u201c by Chasity Singletary (5k grant) <br \/>9.\t\u201cHiding Spot\u201d by Edrei Hutson ($1000 honorable mention)<br \/>10.\t\u201cBlack Agency\u201d by Caralene Robinson ($1,000) honorable mention <br \/>11.\t\u201cAgainst Nature\u201d by Stephanie Soto ($1,000) honorable mention <br \/>12.\t\u201cPastor\u201d by Raquel Thomas ($1,000) honorable mention <br \/>13.\t\u201cSpare Parts\u201d by Kelli Loghtfoot ($1,000) honorable mention <br \/>14.\t\u201cLovelock\u201d by Keisha Brown ($1,000) honorable mention <\/p>\n<p>About Ericka Nicole Malone <br \/>Ericka Nicole Malone is an award-winning filmmaker, businesswoman, and writer who is building her own brand of entertainment in Hollywood.

Remember Me is currently available on the Hulu streaming service. <\/p>\n<p>Early in her career she understood the obstacles faced by female filmmakers, and women of color, so she chose to bet on herself and create an entertainment company that tells stories that speak to the Black experience in her own unique voice. Not only was she conscious of the lack of female creatives, but also the margin of people of color behind the scenes; for this reason, her productions are staffed with a diverse group of skilled individuals. <br \/>A multifaceted businesswoman, Ericka is co-owner of The MCR Group, a healthcare consulting firm and continues to oversee the business of Ericka Nicole Malone Entertainment, with business partner Phillip Robinson.  <\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Ericka Nicole Malone Entertainment, the ENME Power \u201cEN-ME\u201d Grant, or to schedule an interview or speaking engagement with Ericka Nicole Malone, visit erickanicolemalone.com or contact Amy Malone, Girl in Charge Public Relations.   <\/p>\n<p>###<br \/>Girl in Charge Public Relations is a black female owned full-service communications firm that provides publicity, public relations, talent coordination, and brand management for high profile individuals and organizations.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Amy Malone<br \/>Girl in Charge Public Relations<br \/>+1 909-804-0999<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/675872706\/mailto:amy@gicpublicrelations.net\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">amy@gicpublicrelations.net<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/erickanicolemaloneent\/?hl=en\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=Gi6R5hI_Yop-2WLH&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      December 18, 2023, 17:19 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/675872706\/the-ericka-nicole-malone-entertainment-power-en-me-grant-awards-46k-in-funds-to-woc-filmmakers-during-the-holidays\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
