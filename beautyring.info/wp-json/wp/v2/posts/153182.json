Through its programming, TFA recruits and develops a diverse corps of outstanding leaders who make an initial two-year commitment to teach in high-need schools and become lifelong leaders in the effort to end educational inequity.<\/p>\n<p>TFA Nevada had 87 corps members in the 2023-24 school year and works with more than 50 partner schools, primarily in the <span class=\"xn-location\">Clark County<\/span> School District.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This Sands Cares contribution is an investment\u00a0in <span class=\"xn-location\">Nevada&#8217;s<\/span> future,&#8221; <span class=\"xn-person\">Sean Parker<\/span>, executive director, at Teach for America Nevada, said. &#8220;This critical support helps us recruit and retain diverse and talented educational leaders who accelerate the progress of young Nevadans in their journey toward economic mobility.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>Support for the RootED Fellowship: <\/b>Half of the Sands Cares funding will support the RootED Fellowship, which provides grants to retain TFA corps members who have completed their initial two-year commitment to the organization. The program aims to lower transiency rates and keep more experienced teachers in high-need school sites.<\/p>\n<p>The RootED Fellowship is a critical retention program since the most challenged schools in the <span class=\"xn-location\">Clark County<\/span> School District have an annual teacher transiency rate of just over 22% compared to a district-wide rate of just over 16%. This turnover exacerbates inequities in student achievement, which can translate into lifelong disparities in educational, career and financial outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>The Sands Cares contribution to the RootED Fellowship enables engagement with 20-25 high-performing educators who lead in high-need schools located in Clark County.\u00a0The fellowship will provide teachers with tailored professional development and community across the <span class=\"xn-location\">Southern Nevada<\/span> educational landscape.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Support for Local Recruitment Efforts: <\/b>The balance of the Sands Cares funding will support TFA Nevada&#8217;s recruiting efforts with the goal of attracting at least 50 new teachers for the start of the 2024-2025 school year to <span class=\"xn-location\">Clark County<\/span> School District. In addition, the contribution also will underwrite workforce development programming and resources that support educator retention, which are important components in paving the way to improved educational outcomes for underserved students.<\/p>\n<p>Sands&#8217; contribution to TFA Nevada aims to address pressing public education needs in <span class=\"xn-location\">Southern Nevada<\/span>. At the start of the 2023-2024 school year, <span class=\"xn-location\">Clark County<\/span> School District reported nearly 1,200 teacher vacancies, and many of the school sites with the highest number of vacancies are in Title I schools that serve historically under-resourced and low-income households in which student achievement is disproportionately impacted.<\/p>\n<p>Sands&#8217; partnership with TFA Nevada is aligned with the company&#8217;s focus on education as part of its commitment to helping build a well-trained, diverse and thriving workforce of the future.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;TFA Nevada is a vital resource for the public education system in <span class=\"xn-location\">Southern Nevada<\/span>, and we want to help increase its impact by supporting efforts to retain and recruit high-quality educators,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Ron Reese<\/span>, senior vice president of global communications and corporate affairs, who spearheads corporate responsibility initiatives for the company. &#8220;TFA&#8217;s work aligns with our focus on ensuring our communities maintain a strong educational foundation and closing gaps in access to resources that improve student outcomes.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Sands&#8217; work in education, read the company&#8217;s latest ESG report: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sands.com\/resources\/reports\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.sands.com\/resources\/reports\/<\/a>.
