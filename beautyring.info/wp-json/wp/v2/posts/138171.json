Each year, without fail, they demonstrate their commitment to making the world a better place by assembling hygiene kits for those in need. This year, Sands China assembled over 27,000 hygiene kits for Children International in <span class=\"xn-location\">the Philippines<\/span>. With millions worldwide lacking access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), we are extremely thankful to have partners as committed as Sands China, as they play a crucial role in ensuring proper access to these essential resources for everyone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sands <span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> support of Clean the World is part of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sands.com\/sands-cares\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Sands Cares<\/a>, the global corporate citizenship programme of Las Vegas Sands Corp., and the Sands ECO360 global sustainability strategy.<\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p><b>About Sands China Ltd. <\/b><\/p>\n<p>Sands China Ltd.
