Within the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/saferworldbydesign.com\/nextgen-basel-1\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">NextGen Basel 1 symposium<\/a>, held on the 1 March 2024, we aimed to bring different stakeholders together to support collaboration developing innovation and application opportunities that will drive the acceptance of new approach methods forward. Our goals include reduction and replacement of animal testing, structured evidence-based risk assessment, and safer by design applied to products, environmental protection, and sustainability. During this meeting and related interactions, we discuss existing and potential case study work promoting the use of methods and data providing sufficient quality of evidence for decision-making for well-formulated problems. We also aim to promote the industrial and regulatory acceptance of new forms of scientific evidence in product design and safety assessment.\u201d Barry Hardy, CEO of Edelweiss Connect.<\/p>\n<p>Participants in the NextGen Basel 1 symposium comprised leading expertise from SaferWorldbyDesign partners and collaborators on related research and innovation projects providing new methods for further refinement, development, and testing on industrial problem formulations and included large industrial organisations interested in NextGen solutions (Dow Chemical, Syngenta, Unilever, Novartis, Beiersdorf), SME innovators (Edelweiss Connect, DNTOX, InSphero, TissUse, Net Zero Impact), research projects (RISK-HUNT3R, PrecisionTox, ONTOX), academic institutions (FHNW, University of Konstanz) and regulatory scientists (SCAHT).<\/p>\n<p>The topics covered at the symposium overlapped significantly with current and forward-looking SaferWorldbyDesign target solution areas included New Approach Methods (NAMS) for regulatory applications, the ASPA risk assessment workflow framework, modelling the blood-brain-barrier in vitro, ontologies as the basis for setting up animal-free test batteries, co-expression network analysis of toxicogenomic data, cross-species, multi-omics analyses as a new approach to chemical hazard assessment, multi-organ-on-chip in safety and efficacy testing, risk stratification exemplified by human liver microtissues, NAMS and practical industrial risk assessment, use of modern approaches in pesticide design and risk assessment, use of new approach methodologies in defined approaches for skin sensitization assessment, environmental risk assessment of cosmetic ingredients, elucidation of hormonal dependencies and associated species specificities of key neuro-developmental processes to improve risk assessment, 3D vessel on-chip system for the assessment of vascular toxicities, bridging AI\/ML advancements with risk assessment needs, safer and sustainable by design approaches, and life cycle and sustainability analysis.<\/p>\n<p>More information is provided at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/saferworldbydesign.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/saferworldbydesign.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Connor Hardy<br \/>Edelweiss Connect<br \/>+1 503-201-4725<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/698632750\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=j6AEt1ue6Pb06jHS&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      March 25, 2024, 18:32 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/698632750\/edelweiss-connect-launches-saferworldbydesign-nextgen-initiative\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
