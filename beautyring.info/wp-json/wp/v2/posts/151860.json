He was retired in 2017. Using the concept of life as a journey, he wrote a novel as a strategy for patient care throughout his career. He has assisted patients in understanding and facing their individual experiences.<\/p>\n<p>Particularly in high-conflict divorce situations, Dana Cogan has made substantial contributions to the fields of psychiatry and child advocacy. He is an example of setting up families and suggesting parenting strategies that prioritize the welfare of the kids. His work has impacted Colorado&#8217;s and other states&#8217; established procedures for family assessments.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from his clinical work, Dana Cogan has assessed and treated criminally insane people. Additionally, evaluated doctors&#8217; suitability for the Board of Medical Examiners. He has also evaluated parents&#8217; abilities in situations where abuse of children is suspected. Through several talks and published writings, he has also played a significant role in training judges, attorneys, and other mental health professionals.<\/p>\n<p>Dana Cogan&#8217;s contributions to the legal and mental health communities have been recognized with multiple awards. One is for his role in changing divorce laws to replace the term &#8220;custody&#8221; with &#8220;parental responsibility.&#8221; This change has since been adopted in other states, reflecting his lasting impact on family law.<\/p>\n<p>Dana Cogan, M.D., has set off on a transformative journey of personal growth.
