Future Market Insight estimated a CAGR of 6.4% for the market between 2023 and 2033.<\/p>\n<p>Demand for paints and coatings has increased in recent decades for various reasons. Architectural coatings are expected to experience the highest level of growth. The usage of architectural coatings has directly impacted the demand for additives such as hindered amine light stabilizers. The rising demand for industrial coatings in various sectors is expected to drive the demand for hindered amine light stabilizers throughout the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p>The demand for plastic packaging materials, automotive components and coatings, and agricultural films is increasing. The use of HALS is on the rise in commercial and industrial settings. These stabilizers are applied in various ways including in the production of UV-resistant coated plastics, wood products, and polymers.<\/p>\n<p>In many applications, plastic materials are utilized with increasing frequency. The design of plastic products is constantly evolving to meet changing requirements. To keep up with these demands, the plastic industry relies heavily on polymers, polymer blends, and polymer additives.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>There has been a significant increase in demand for additives that improve the properties of plastics. This also includes protecting them from damage caused by exposure to UV light and high temperatures. Stakeholders in the plastics industry seek ways to improve product performance. HALS are gradually used to improve the durability and lifespan of plastic products.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get an overview of market drivers and challenges affecting this industry<\/strong><strong>: <\/strong><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=YxzeR9OkEY62nTP6ExcteNdjM3qRWH9OhHOP4pSOnQZW0PXFOWlgloJ91H5B2KM-lSzPcB16nKDChcjrsMj_gtD5g1o4lSJT2g4MExErBXEhxkwJoEmukDvLEun9gFATzBvKs6J4AOuhCbw96cQpsJCbhvwSXZkrGuPvhDMMWsQVWtVWtZ7VO4g4u60KXXuV26JjjhMo_IfzHueySeaIkg==\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.futuremarketinsights.com\/reports\/sample\/rep-gb-17157<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Given the increasing demand for packaged products along with the requirements of the automotive industry, the market is anticipated to continue its growth trajectory. To meet the need for high-quality, durable packaging materials and products, manufacturers are seeking additives like HALS that can provide excellent performance and withstand prolonged exposure to sunlight.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers in both developed and developing countries have diverse mobility requirements. In the coming years, urbanization is anticipated to result in a rise in automobile ownership. This rise in car ownership is predicted to drive up demand for automotive refinish coatings.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Automotive refinish coatings serve the function of stabilizing paint in various conditions, including exposure to UV rays, humidity, and pollutants. HALS are increasingly used to prevent automotive paint degradation, yellowing, and chalking caused by UV light. They efficiently preserve the sheen of the paint and improve its resistance to various weather conditions. This is likely to open opportunities for market players.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways<\/strong><strong>:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">The hindered amine light stabilizers market in the United States is expected to upsurge at\u00a06.4%\u00a0CAGR during the forecast period.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">The market in the United Kingdom is anticipated to rise profitably, exhibiting a CAGR of\u00a06.2%\u00a0through 2033.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">The market in China is expected to thrive considerably, registering a CAGR of\u00a06.3%\u00a0from 2023 to 2033.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">With a CAGR of\u00a06.3%\u00a0over the forecast period, the market in Japan is predicted to develop rapidly.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">The market in South Korea is predicted to expand significantly between 2023 and 2033, reaching a CAGR of\u00a06.1%.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Didn&#8217;t<\/strong><strong> find the data you are looking for?
