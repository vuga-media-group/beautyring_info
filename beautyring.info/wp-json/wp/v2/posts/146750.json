By specifically targeting the facial muscles, triLift effectively treats structure, contour, and texture, resulting in a naturally lifted look, reduced wrinkles and a tighter, smoother jawline. It also allows for each patient to receive targeted and customized treatments. <\/p>\n<p>Finally, practitioners in Canada can go beyond the skin, to address a key cause of facial aging\u2014the muscles. With triLift, addressing the facial muscles is possible without invasive surgical methods. triLift\u2019s Dynamic Muscle Stimulation technology (DMSt) activates and tones facial muscles by stimulating muscle contractions that mimic physiological muscle function, but at a high frequency and intensity. This dynamic approach results in visible and natural-looking results from the first treatment.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is an exciting moment and ultimate game changer for those who are seeking a non-invasive way to address the facial muscle,\u201d stated Dr. James Chelnis of Manhattan Face and Eye. \u201cFor patients who want to avoid injectables and surgery, triLift\u2019s facial muscle stimulation technology is a major breakthrough for the Canadian market. triLift by Lumenis is a unique device, allowing providers to target a patient&#8217;s specific need with a quick, comfortable treatment option. Patients will love that the results are visible and noticeable\u201d.

Regenerating collagen, (2) increasing dermal thickness by 50%2, and reducing wrinkles by 30%3.<br \/>&#8211; triFX Radiofrequency Microneedling, with its ultrathin needles, increases smoothness by 80%3, and triples hyaluronic acid production (3). This combination offers significant results without downtime or numbing.<\/p>\n<p>Patients and physicians across Canada now have a safe, approachable, non-invasive, 20-30 minute in-office treatment option that is designed to specifically address the facial muscles and deliver a face lift-like effect. Celebrities such as Alyssa Milano, Jennie Garth, Colton Underwood, Kerri Walsh, Teddi Mellencamp, and Teresa Guidice, all expressed their enthusiasm regarding their resulted natural lifted look.

Patients can now regain their youthful and toned appearance through a natural, non-invasive, energy-based solution.
