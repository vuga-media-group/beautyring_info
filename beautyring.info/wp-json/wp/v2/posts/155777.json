But we can live with more awareness of our blinders and with compassion for those in other worlds.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Worlds Apart invites readers to join Lutterodt on her compelling journey, from a sheltered post-war childhood on a farm in southern England to her life-changing years teaching university in Ghana, followed by her challenging immersion in the rough and tumble of the American business world. <\/p>\n<p>With her husband, a Ghanaian mathematician, she struggles to find a place for her biracial family in a 1980s America that isn\u2019t always welcoming. <\/p>\n<p>In retirement, Lutterodt lives between two worlds: a newly experienced Ghana and an America for whom Africa too often remains the \u201cdark continent.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>While the memoir tells stories from each chapter of Lutterodt\u2019s life, the underlying themes are of identity and belonging, and the joys and challenges in living at the interface between different cultures \u2014 recognizing boundaries to be navigated while seeking to build bridges of understanding. <\/p>\n<p>In reflecting on her life\u2019s journey, Lutterodt has drawn inspiration from the teachings of the renowned Franciscan friar Richard Rohr. Echoing the title of his seminal work, Everything Belongs, she concludes, \u201cI am grateful to have experienced moments when a boundary that separates my life from others has become porous, illuminated by the bonds of our common humanity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<br \/>Sarah Lutterodt was born and educated in England, gaining a BA degree in physics from the University of Oxford, an M.Phil. in nuclear physics from the University of London and a Ph.D. in Education from the University of Birmingham. She has spent most of her adult life outside England, working for two years at the University of Lovanium in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and subsequently at the University of Cape Coast in Ghana. It was there that she met her husband, Clement, a Ghanaian mathematician with whom she has three children. In 1980, the family moved to the United States, where Lutterodt worked as a technical training consultant for General Physics Corporation before starting her own business, Quality Training Systems, in 1997. Now in retirement, she and Clement divide their time between their homes in Columbia, Maryland, and Accra, Ghana.<\/p>\n<p>Connect with the author on LinkedIn: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sarah-lutterodt-ph-d-4a848470\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sarah-lutterodt-ph-d-4a848470\/<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Amazon link: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Worlds-Apart-Memoir-Uncertain-Belonging\/dp\/B0CVDLXBV2\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Worlds-Apart-Memoir-Uncertain-Belonging\/dp\/B0CVDLXBV2<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Worlds Apart: A Memoir of Uncertain Belonging<br \/>Publisher: Atmosphere Press<br \/>Paperback: \u200e366 pages <br \/>ISBN-13: \u200e979-8891322042 <br \/>Available from Amazon.com<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Trish Stevens<br \/>Ascot Media Group, Inc.<br \/>+1 832-334-2733<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/727744362\" data-src=\"ZK5qAQ9tNNrKUoEK\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AscotMediaGroup\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AscotMediaGroup\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">X<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/trish-stevens-99728335\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=qDApLsS2IqzWS2hv&amp;i=ZK5qAQ9tNNrKUoEK\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      July 15, 2024, 17:19 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/727744362\/compelling-true-story-weaves-threads-of-connection-across-multiple-cultures\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
