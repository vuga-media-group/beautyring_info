The musical based on the CD reflects the life of Mary Cardwell Dawson (1894-1962) who founded the historic National Negro Opera Company in Pittsburgh in 1941.<\/p>\n<p>The stage project, as well as a just&#8211;released CD, are being produced under the umbrella of the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/overmyshoulderfoundation.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Over My Shoulder<\/a> Foundation (OMSF) in Boston.  OMSF is a non-profit organization founded by Boston songwriter <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dawnmcarroll.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Dawn Carroll<\/a> and Patti Austin with the goal of raising awareness of the impact of mentoring. The announcement was made in recognition of the January 21-25 National Thank Your Mentor Week.  Details of the stage workshop production will be announced in the coming weeks.

The headquarters of the National Negro Opera Company was a grand Victorian home that many called \u201cMystery Manor\u201d. The mansion became a gathering place and refuge for Black celebrities who could perform in public but were not allowed out in public after sunset including boxer Joe Louis, baseball great Roberto Clemente, Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Lena Horne, and so many others. Each song on the 15 song soundtrack is about the legends who stayed at the mansion.

Happily, the newest owner has created a nonprofit organization to restore and maintain the Queen Anne-style mansion. Over My Shoulder Foundation also has plans to film a documentary of the preservation and restoration of the mansion. <\/p>\n<p>Patti Austin, who has recently been nominated for yet another Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album, is passionate about mentoring the next generation: \u201cIt is so critically important that young people have an opportunity to work closely with adults, and especially on a project like this one that reflects on an almost forgotten chapter of both Black history and women\u2019s history. Through mentoring, our goal is to break down barriers that separate people of different generations and cultures.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The songs on the CD \u201cSongs for Mary\u201d that form the soundtrack for the stage musical  were written by Dawn Carroll with longtime Boston rock veteran Jon Butcher, whose production, arranging, guitar and vocal skills are prominently featured. In addition to rap, the songs embrace rock, pop, jazz and even classical music.<\/p>\n<p>The CD kicks off with \u201cIf The Walls Could Talk,\u201d as a young rapper contemplates the abandoned mansion and channels the spirit and energy \u2014 and pain \u2014  of Dawson and her prominent Black visitors. The final track on the CD, \u201cRise\u201d, is a fierce denunciation of racial discrimination from the perspective of one of Dawson\u2019s distinguished guests, heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis.<\/p>\n<p>To find out more about Mary Cardwell Dawson, the CD \u201cSongs for Mary\u201d and the efforts to preserve the Victorian manor home of the National Negro Opera Company, please visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/songsformary.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/songsformary.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Anthony Fusco<br \/>Fusco &amp; Four<br \/>+1 617-363-0405<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/691774630\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OverMyShoulderFoundation\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/omsfoundation\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/dawn-carroll-1506421a\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/dawnmichellecarroll\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@songs4mary\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">If The Walls Could Talk &#8211; History of Mary Cardwell Dawson<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"h2QOs0QK6Ho\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Songs for Mary RISE! #MaryCardwellDawson\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/h2QOs0QK6Ho?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=zP-7ZJor5LTun7zH&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      February 27, 2024, 21:07 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/691774630\/grammy-award-winner-patti-austin-in-stage-workshop-as-mary-cardwell-dawson-founder-of-national-negro-opera-company\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
