The market is estimated to be valued at <strong>US$ 1,377.7 million in 2024<\/strong> and reach a valuation of <strong>US$ 3,327.8 million by 2034<\/strong>. This growth is expected to be driven by a <strong>CAGR of 7.3%<\/strong> through 2034 as more consumers adopt plant-based diets due to health concerns and lifestyle disorders. The trend of veganism is particularly pronounced in the confectionery industry, where manufacturers have developed a range of plant-based products to cater to the growing market demand.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The global vegan confectionery market has witnessed remarkable growth in recent years, driven by several factors. One of the key drivers of this growth is the increasing popularity of veganism, particularly among millennials and the working population.
