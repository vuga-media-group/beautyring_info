Timbaland&#8217; the musical mastermind is behind the most memorable hits of our times. With over 18-Grammy nominations, 4-Grammy wins and 200+ ASCAP Music awards, his indelible imprint has been stamped on countless hits from some of the most successful and legendary artists in the world. From Jay-Z&#8217;s &#8220;Dirt Off Your Shoulder&#8221; and &#8220;Big Pimpin,&#8221; to <span class=\"xn-person\">Justin Timberlake&#8217;s<\/span> &#8220;Sexy Back&#8221; and &#8220;Cry Me A River,&#8221; Aaliyah&#8217;s &#8220;One In A Million,&#8221; <span class=\"xn-person\">Missy Elliott&#8217;s<\/span> &#8220;Get Ur Freak On&#8221; and &#8220;Work It,&#8221; Ginuwine&#8217;s &#8220;Pony,&#8221; and One Republic&#8217;s &#8220;Apologize&#8221; amongst many others, Timbaland&#8217;s credits have established him as one of the most iconic producers in the last 30 years.<\/p>\n<p>Among his long list of accolades are hits he&#8217;s produced for artists including <span class=\"xn-person\">Kanye West<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Bryson Tiller<\/span>, Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9, <span class=\"xn-person\">Katy Perry<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Mariah Carey<\/span>, Rihanna, <span class=\"xn-person\">Sam Smith<\/span>, Maluma, <span class=\"xn-person\">Nelly Furtado<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Keri Hilson<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Brad Paisley<\/span>, Coldplay, Nickelback, The Fray, Destiny&#8217;s Child, Ludacris, Jodeci, Snoop Dogg, Drake, <span class=\"xn-person\">Alicia Keys<\/span> and countless others.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1990s, his partnership with high school friend <span class=\"xn-person\">Missy Elliott<\/span> blossomed into a pairing that delivered legendary R&amp;B singer Aaliyah&#8217;s double-platinum sophomore album, One in A Million, which went on to sell over 15-million copies worldwide. Becoming one of music&#8217;s most successful production\/songwriting teams, as a result, Elliott naturally looked to Timbaland to help define her as an artist. Their work together, which included tracks such as &#8220;The Rain,&#8221; catapulted Elliott to major stardom and critical acclaim.<\/p>\n<p>Timbaland&#8217;s collaboration with <span class=\"xn-person\">Justin Timberlake<\/span> went on to become one of the most successful and iconic partnerships in music, producing the 2006 mega-hit &#8220;Sexy Back&#8221; which sold over 6-million copies and became Timberlake&#8217;s first #1 single on the Billboard Hot 100. Together, the two went on to have a tremendous amount of success, selling over 30-million albums worldwide with multiple #1 hits including &#8220;Cry Me A River,&#8221; &#8220;<span class=\"xn-person\">My Love<\/span>,&#8221; &#8220;What Goes Around Comes Around,&#8221; &#8220;4 Minutes,&#8221; &#8220;Give It to Me,&#8221; &#8220;Suit and Tie,&#8221; &#8220;Mirrors,&#8221; and more.<\/p>\n<p>Born <span class=\"xn-person\">Timothy Z.
