H3 Entertainment was excited to announce the creation of an NFT-related IP of &#8220;The Classic of the Mountain and Seas&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Classic of the Mountains and Seas,&#8221; also known as &#8220;Shan Hai Jing&#8221; is a popular Chinese classic, a compilation of ancient Chinese myths, legends, and folklore. It is considered one of the earliest examples of Chinese literature and has had a significant influence on Chinese culture, art, and mythology.<\/p>\n<p>H3E&#8217;s version of the classic story takes on a cyberpunk style with the promise of a fresh, visually stunning take on the story. <\/p>\n<p>Overall, this announcement stands as a testament to the growing importance of NFTs in the world of entertainment but also a nod to the remarkable potential they hold for creators and enthusiasts alike.

(Advanced Online Ticketing NFT Platform).<\/p>\n<p>The Past Painting The Future\uff1a<\/p>\n<p>On the final day of the EDGE Summit, Sid Ganis, an industry veteran with decades of experience in Hollywood and H3E Co-Founder, illuminated the potential of the role that Web 3.0 will have in the entertainment landscape.<\/p>\n<p>In his keynote session, Ganis addressed the audience with his wealth of knowledge and insights on the film industry&#8217;s past, present, and future. Ganis emphasized a fundamental truth during his talk \u2013 no matter what AI brings to the table, it\u2019s storytelling remains at the heart of entertainment and media, and human input will always be the key to the best stories.<\/p>\n<p>He emphasized that while technology is monumental, it must coexist harmoniously with the heart and soul of storytelling. &#8220;No question about it. This wonderful new technology before us is clearly the way forward, but still the basis for the way forward is the expression of the emotion of love and compassionate story telling,&#8221; Ganis highlighted.<\/p>\n<p>H3 Entertainment anticipated that the Edge Sumit would be an exciting experience and are proud to have played a part in it.
