Acrylic-based coatings are used to provide an excellent topping to metal. This is expected to boost the demand for solvent-based acrylic coatings in the automotive industry. In addition, acrylic coatings are used for general protection from dirt and grime in both indoor and outdoor applications and they tend to form a thin protecting layer on concrete due to which it is widely used in commercial buildings, residential, and non-residential sectors. This is anticipated to increase the sales of solvent-based concrete sealers; thus, creating remunerative opportunities for the market.
