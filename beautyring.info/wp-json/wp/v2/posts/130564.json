It&#8217;s a dystopian, action-packed side-scroller with tight mechanics and intricate level design. Battle techno-terrorists with a chakram and grenades, eat hot dogs for health, and locate contacts to help take down bosses.<\/p>\n<p>A group of Techno-Terrorists have infiltrated Prison City (formerly Detroit). The outsiders quickly indoctrinate the criminals and supply them with weapons to build an army. Each security zone is overtaken by an appointed Techno-Terrorist warden. Not much is known about the leader of the Techno-Terrorists or their motive, but the group has been in power ever since. As former cop Hal Bruzer, take on the Chief\u2019s request to raid Prison City\u2019s security zones and bring an end to the Techno-Terrorists\u2019 reign.<\/p>\n<p>Key Features:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 Retro-style gameplay comparable to a late NES game<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 Discoverable secrets and upgrades<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 8+ diverse zones, like Freeways, Factories, &amp; a Nature Preserve<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 Customizable difficult and gameplay experience<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 Boss Mode and Bomb Mode for extended gameplay<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 There&#8217;s a talking dolphin<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Prison City is one of the best platformers I&#8217;ve played in quite a while. If you&#8217;re wanting something that has that 80&#8217;s platformer edge with a more forgiving difficulty, this is the game!&#8221; &#8211; Voultar, Hardware Modder<\/p>\n<p>Lead developer Programancer is a Michigan-based dev, artist, and programmer behind several retro-inspired titles such as Dumpy and Bumpy and The Transylvania Adventure of Simon Quest. They are also the host of the yearly itch io RetrogradeJam &#8212; and in July 2022 Prison City&#8217;s development started. Programancer has kept two goals in mind during Prison City\u2019s development: First, to reuse systems and packages from their other games to make a killer gameplay experience as quickly as possible. And second, to make a game that feels heavy, but kinetic, and aesthetically inspired by seminal NES games such as Shatterhand and Power Blade.<\/p>\n<p>Prison City is available NOW on Steam and the Epic Games Store. The console ports (Nintendo Switch, Xbox One\/X\/S, and PlayStation 4\/5) will be out in early October.
