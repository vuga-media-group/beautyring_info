Nucleotide supplementation significantly impacts the immune system and digestive tract cells&#8217; rapid development and proliferation. Exogenous nucleotides have also shown promise as dietary supplements to improve disease resistance and the immune system. As a result, nucleotides have become more and more necessary for the pharmaceutical sector.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b>Regional Insights<\/b><br \/>Asia-Pacific dominates the market and is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 8.06% over the projected period. Due to the top nucleotide producer in the area, growing consumer interest in nutraceuticals, and expansion of the health food industry, it is anticipated that demand for the product would increase. The nucleotide market is also expected to grow over the forecast period due to increasing research into food and beverage additives, particularly in Asia. Regarding GDP, China has the largest economy in Asia-Pacific. The market for nucleotides in pharmaceutical manufacturing is anticipated to be driven by the increased demand for medications by an aging population and the advent of new illnesses during the projected period.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">The second-largest market share belongs to North America. By 2030, the region&#8217;s economic output is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 7.76%. The US&#8217;s presence, which has the largest economy in the world, is essential to the development of this area. The pharmaceutical industry has always been one of the biggest and most R&amp;D-intensive industries in the US. Undoubtedly, the United States has one of the most advanced healthcare systems in the world. The growth of the healthcare sector and the usage of pharmaceuticals in the nation have been aided by the expanding senior population and the increasing need for medical facilities to treat chronic diseases.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Europe has the largest healthcare market. It is well known that this region is the best place to create, produce, and market premium medications. The country benefits from its extensive industrial heritage, cutting-edge research, and easy access to the international pharmaceutical market. Germany is home to the biggest pharmaceutical market in Europe. It is also called the World&#8217;s Pharmacy on a global scale. Due to the active presence of several multinational pharmaceutical companies, this region has grown its share of the pharmaceutical sector. Since there are so many pharmaceutical companies, ongoing research is done to develop new treatments.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><b>Key Highlights<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The global <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/nucleotides-market\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>nucleotides market size<\/u><\/a> is expected to reach a value of USD 1,095 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.63% during the forecast period (2022\u20132030).<\/li>\n<li>By nitrogenous base, the global nucleotide market is bifurcated into Pyrimidine and Purine.
