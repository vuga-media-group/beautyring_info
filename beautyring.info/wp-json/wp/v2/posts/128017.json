The same segment is projected to register the highest CAGR of 7.2% during the forecast period. The demand for sugarcane is driven by factors such as population growth, change in consumer preferences, industrial uses, economic development, bio-based products, and the ongoing need for sugar as a food ingredient has enhanced the overall potential sales of policosanol market during the forecast period. Furthermore, policosanol, derived from sugarcane, has been studied for its potential health benefits. Sugarcane-derived policosanol is used to support overall cardiovascular health due to its cholesterol-modulating effects. It helps to reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular conditions.
