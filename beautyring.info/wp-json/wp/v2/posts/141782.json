Award-winning author Mary Wissinger\u2019s new picture book, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencenaturally.com\/product-page\/talking-science\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Talking Science<\/a>, not only provides a unique perspective on the history of measurements but also underscores the power of the universal language of science we have today.<\/p>\n<p>How do scientists all around the world understand each other\u2019s work? They learn the language of science! From kilograms to seconds to moles, Talking Science teaches kids the seven universal measurements with easy-to-understand examples and lively illustrations from the world around us. See how science connects us all through the International System of Units, a group of seven measurements\u2014seconds, meters, kilograms, amperes, kelvins, moles, and candelas\u2014that allow scientists from anywhere in the world to understand each other. <\/p>\n<p>With inviting and fun illustrations by Lilia Miceli, this innovative 32-page children\u2019s book uses kid-friendly examples to show readers how big ideas can be shared\u2014and how science connects us all. A cozy hug is one meter wide, a good night\u2019s sleep is 41,400 seconds long, and an African elephant weighs almost 5,500 kilograms. No matter where you are in the world, scientists use these same units of measurement to communicate with one another. Tailored to readers ages 2 to 7, Talking Science brings science vocabulary to life for even the youngest children, providing real examples of measurements that children can relate to and use in their everyday lives! <\/p>\n<p>Claire Cock-Stockey, author of The Curious History of Weights &amp; Measures says, \u201cWith simple yet engaging text and charming illustrations, Talking Science introduces young children to the language of measurement. A great addition to classrooms and libraries everywhere!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Talking Science introduces the foundations of measurement at an age where children aren\u2019t intimidated by STEM subjects yet. Librarians, parents, and educators will love sharing this book with young readers because it encourages childrens\u2019 interest in the world around them. Talking Science also serves as a history lesson, introducing all the different types of measurement that existed before a standard system was developed\u2014and how the International System of Units now means we can easily share exciting discoveries worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>Mary Wissinger was born in Wisconsin, where she spent most of her childhood singing, reading, and daydreaming. She dove into storytelling through acting, singing, and writing (and writing and writing). While spending time as a classroom teacher sharing the magic of music, she saw firsthand the incredible life-changing power of stories. Mary lives in St. Louis, MO where she writes stories that inspire curiosity about the world and connection with others. She is also the author of the Science Wide Open series and the My First Science Textbook series.

She studied 2D animation at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia of Turin and is now a professional illustrator. Drawing is her primary form of communication, and she likes to use her creativity to make the world a better place by dealing with important topics and creating something beautiful that raises the souls of those who see it. She also enjoys sharing food and drinks with friends, cuddling every cute animal she meets, and pretending to be a mermaid.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencenaturally.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Science Naturally<\/a> is a small independent press in Washington, D.C.
