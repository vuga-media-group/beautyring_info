As the notion of loyalty is transforming, loyalty management needs to become even more strategic. Today, loyalty must be factored into the customer journey from acquisition to retention to growth, while findings on the efficiency of loyalty programmes have shown a direct tie back to lifetime value, as well as revenue and profitability KPIs. <\/p>\n<p>The days of only considering traditional points-based loyalty programmes are over. Customers today see themselves as co-creators of the loyalty agenda and require a stronger value proposition, where financial transactions aren\u2019t prerequisites of earning a reward. Moreover, they also welcome charity and ESG-linked loyalty rewards and deeper personalisation in exchange for their data. In order to meet these needs, companies often need to amend their in-house capabilities with loyalty management partners who can provide support with technology and the collection and analysis of customer data. What they should keep in mind is that the more diverse a business\u2019s loyalty programme is, the more simplified, connected and consolidated the back-end execution should be. <\/p>\n<p>Marigold\u2019s <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/go.meetmarigold.com\/en-gb\/loyalty-guide?&amp;utm_medium=Paid-Media&amp;utm_source=Businessreporter&amp;utm_content=New%20Kind%20Of%20Loyalty%20En\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">A buyer\u2019s guide to enterprise loyalty management<\/a> created in association with Let\u2019s Talk Loyalty offers guidance on how a business can find its ideal loyalty partner, while <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/go.meetmarigold.com\/new-kind-of-loyalty?&amp;utm_medium=Paid-Media&amp;utm_source=Businessreporter&amp;utm_content=New%20Kind%20Of%20Loyalty%20En\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Marigold\u2019s report<\/a> on emotional loyalty explains the techniques of increasing a customer\u2019s lifetime value. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nTo learn more about the three pillars of loyalty management, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.business-reporter.co.uk\/retail\/loyalty-management-priorities-for-2024-are-you-ready\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">read the article<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>About Business Reporter<\/p>\n<p>Business Reporter is an award-winning company producing supplements published in The Guardian and City AM, as well as content published on Business Reporter online hubs on Bloomberg.com, Independent.com, Business Insider Germany and Le Figaro, delivering news and analysis on issues affecting the international business community.
