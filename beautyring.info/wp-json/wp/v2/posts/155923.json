Recent additions to further enhance the team include <span class=\"xn-person\">Dury Kim<\/span>, Vice President, Revenue &amp; Distribution, who joined the company in 2023. Additionally, <span class=\"xn-person\">Shannon Myers<\/span>, Vice President, Sales, has been with the company since 1994 and has been recognized with numerous sales awards, including Global Sales Team of the Year and Sales Excellence in Leadership Award; and <span class=\"xn-person\">Rhonda Carr<\/span>, Vice President, Sales, a twenty-year veteran of InnVentures who has also been a multiyear Hotel Sales Excellence Award winner.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;InnVentures&#8217; success is built upon its distinctive brand of operational excellence, optimizing ecommerce strategies to maximize revenue management and a strong, onsite direct sales team. This mix is what has propelled our hotels to increase their market share approximately 15% above the industry average,&#8221; according to Montrose.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>InnVentures anticipates a similar pace of expansion through the balance of 2024, with additional management contracts to be announced later this year, marking entry into additional new markets as well as existing regions.<\/p>\n<p><b>About InnVentures<br class=\"dnr\"><u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4207257-1&amp;h=143377473&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3863839-1%26h%3D1991297802%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.innventures.com%252F%26a%3DInnVentures&amp;a=InnVentures\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">InnVentures<\/a><\/u><\/b>\u00a0operates over 85 hotels for the nation&#8217;s largest REITs, PE firms and individual and family-owned hotels.
