shellfish towers. The 50-seat space with an eye-catching design and custom blue velvet wallcoverings sets the tone for meals worth lingering over, and special menus to remember, which skew more New American than Emilia&#8217;s in presentation and delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Each experience begins with a menu of hand-crafted hors d&#8217;oeuvres from Chef Paine meant to enjoy alongside premium martinis shaken tableside, highly allocated reserve wines and vintage champagne pours, personally selected by Sommelier Joel Teddlie. The dinner menu is focused and succinct, offering a curated experience. Like Emilia&#8217;s, menus embrace Mediterranean qualities with dishes that are light, fresh, and vibrant, while offering touches and items worth indulging in.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We designed menus at The Blue Room to offer something special at every course,&#8221; said Chef Paine, who has years of experience working at fine-dining restaurants including Eleven Madison Park in <span class=\"xn-location\">New York City<\/span>. &#8220;Each dish is opulent and polished and prepared using &#8216;low intervention&#8217; methods to preserve the natural flavors of the product. We have created a truly special offering that we are confident will be sought-after by locals and epicureans from across the country.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Signature dishes include seared scallop, Wagyu beef tartare and top-tier meats like venison and lamb loin. The lobster fra diavolo pasta is served with a whole lobster, and guests will have the option to add uni, caviar, truffles and more as enhancements to dishes.<\/p>\n<p>The drink menu selection \u2013 developed by <span class=\"xn-person\">Jamel Taggart<\/span>, Director of Food &amp; Beverage \u2013 is classic yet refined, satisfying connoisseurs and the curious alike. Creative craft cocktails focus on premium martinis, reserve spirits, and world-renowned wines typically not offered by the glass. Memorable cocktails like the Caprese Martini are shaken tableside, and after-dinner drinks focus on Amara, Armagnac, Calvados, and Limoncello, bookending the luxurious experience.<\/p>\n<p>Memorable Chef Collaboration and Wine &amp; Spirit Dinners debut in The Blue Room at Emilia&#8217;s, beginning in March and with limited availability.<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><span class=\"xn-chron\">March 26th<\/span> and 27th &#8211; Executive Chef <span class=\"xn-person\">Preston Paine<\/span> presents an 8-Course Collaboration Menu with noted restaurant Nonesuch<\/li>\n<li>April \u2013 Enjoy an evening with <span class=\"xn-person\">Dean Fearing<\/span>, renowned for his innovative approach to Southwestern cuisine.<\/li>\n<li>May \u2013 Join us for a special dinner featuring a voyage of fine wines from Opus One Winery.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Reservations for The Blue Room are now open on\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4082435-1&amp;h=2889435177&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fresy.com%2Fcities%2Fdfw%2Fthe-blue-room&amp;a=Resy\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Resy<\/a>, for dinners starting\u00a0February 13th.
