However, the regulatory standards governing packaging and protective packaging for food contact applications and pharmaceutical products and the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOC) during the manufacturing and curing processes of plastic and plastic foam-based packaging restrict the market growth. Nevertheless, a surge in R&amp;D activities by several frontrunners to manufacture biodegradable packaging and protective packaging is estimated to offer remunerative growth opportunities in the future.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>The paper and paperboard segment to <\/b><b>maintain<\/b><b> its dominance by <\/b><b>2031<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">By material type, the paper and paperboard segment held the highest market share in 2021, accounting for nearly one-third of the overall market revenue and is projected to retain its dominance from 2022 to 2031. The growth is attributed to stringent norms on the usage of plastic bags and surge in demand for paper and paperboard packaging, particularly from the food and beverage domain. Moreover, the rigid plastic segment would cite the highest growth with 4.7% throughout the forecast timeframe. Rigid plastics are greatly utilized as a packaging material for powders, lotions, creams, cosmetic creams, and others.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>The insulation segment to dominate the market during the forecast period<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">On the basis of function, the insulation segment grabbed the highest market share in 2021, contributing to more than one-fourth of the global packaging and protective packaging market revenue and is estimated to rule the roost from 2022 to 2031. The growth of the segment is driven by the surge in demand for medical supplies, fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, frozen foods, and others resulted in an increase in application of insulation packaging that maintains the temperature of products. The cushioning segment, on the other hand, is expected to witness a fastest growth with 4.8% by 2031. The growth is attributed to robust demand for efficient and secure packaging solutions that offer better transit safety to components by supplying functionality like corner protection, void filling, and blocking and bracing.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Procure Complete Report (2<\/b><b>96<\/b><b> Pages PDF with Insights, Charts, Tables, and Figures) @ <\/b><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=fXdIip_SSgm1j7GWUiAogdZ3Z37uLnjq_SqtkgQ1pDiRWWuGlLcJLbVXELKOT7wJjjzIoiZxYV2KwCQ1kxeNfcUeThawicXqRfO-KEYgki4=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>https:\/\/bit.ly\/3udOyse<\/b><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Asia-Pacific to <\/b><b>witness<\/b><b> a notable growth throughout the forecast <\/b><b>timeframe<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The regional analysis in the report indicates that the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=Zq6TPxCHjhOVlW0c5hfEMwZMacsgrBGdZQ-Oe7CNjhLQiT4ubIz4L_ajBTPrSNsb_J8LUogsJq719LNgrgxkRaDb534HJ1jgY-4zh_Sb92DUu-azOaUy1Vpmc0JbJAQGhUUxCxyp0SfcZ4W7z66qO34zS9sQrjHyRu8RYCMz7mcYhKeU1DRq_5qxZnoaa1oGWMXN0M62GFcMWEVAk4KfKihPiCx_WtcNg_HeMM8YRS4=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>Asia-Pacific region generated the largest revenue<\/b><\/a> in 2021, contributing to more than two-fifths of the total market share and is expected to continue its supremacy during the forecast period.
