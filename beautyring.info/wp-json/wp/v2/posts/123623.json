Increasing prevalence of chronic conditions including diabetes, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis necessitates development of self-administered treatments.<\/p>\n<p>Although self-administration of medications may seem convenient, it can be complicated by several factors, including dosage management and needlestick injuries. However, advancements in technology have addressed these issues and have popularized the use of microneedles for patient-controlled drug administration. Patients and doctors prefer microneedle patches such as solid microneedle patches and hollow microneedle patches. This is due to associated advantages such as faster healing at the injection site, ease of large molecule administration, and rapid &amp; painless drug delivery.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Click Here to Get Free Sample Copy of this Report@ <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=BTopYJ4uCflZz-hQIarUkulNNAPHff1meO9w_DUo1VT_X6wZkdPyVKMVZo3skBZQ4lobz8VbnYMk4h8l2T2jI18mP5emBzPl5CpCyVAvfSi6mHiyco87jypS0B4JsMupn90nWOtM0IYGaappWet1keY7S6pkSj1fCsRTYjguvxcCEqm2apLoY_RkfECmgTZV\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>https:\/\/www.persistencemarketresearch.com\/samples\/32639<\/u><\/a> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Industry leaders are focusing on the development and approval of advanced microneedle drug delivery systems to treat various disorders.
