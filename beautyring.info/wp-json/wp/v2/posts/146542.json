Our client <span>alleges<\/span> that Choice&#8217;s actions ignored the obvious trafficking happening on their properties and were motivated only by profit.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntal\">&#8220;The hotel industry has long been aware of sex trafficking occurring on their properties and have chosen to profit off the venture rather than put in place reasonable measures to protect individuals and the community.
