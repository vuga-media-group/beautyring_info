As a first-generation law student, this scholarship will not only assist me financially, but it will also provide me with the invaluable opportunity to learn from some of the brightest IP professionals in the world.\u201d She added, \u201cI hope to pay this generosity forward by mentoring and uplifting those who come after me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>John M. Whealan, associate dean for IP law and the director of the GW Center for Law and Technology, said Lee \u201cis quite deserving. She is one of the most active and giving IP students at GW Law serving as president of the Student IP Law Association (the largest law student organization), the Social Media Research Assistant for GW&#8217;s IP program, and president of the National Asian Pacific American Law Student Association. In addition, Monica has already clerked at the U.S. International Trade Commission and will extern at the Federal Circuit in the Spring of 2025. Monica exemplifies what ChIPs stands for and will continue to be a leader in IP law and give back to the community,\u201d Whealan said.<\/p>\n<p>Role models<\/p>\n<p>Madrigal said she was \u201cextremely honored and thrilled to be recognized by ChIPs, an organization full of inspiring women in IP who are playing an important role in bringing more women into the field, supporting each other in IP and having their presence to be felt, heard and seen.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Madrigal added that \u201cthis scholarship will help me finish my 3L year strong, focusing on developing my knowledge in IP and supporting others on their journeys without having to worry too much about the financial burdens of law school.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>UCLA Law said, &#8220;We are delighted to hear of Bertha\u2019s selection for this scholarship. In addition to her excellent academic achievement, she has contributed to the community of UCLA School of Law through her leadership and involvement in numerous campus organizations including the Latinx Law Students Association, IP Law Association, UCLA Law Review, UCLA Law Fellows Program, and UCLA&#8217;s Latinx Pre-Law Association. We are confident that she will be a credit to the ChIPs Network and the legal community as a whole.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>ABOUT CHIPS<\/p>\n<p>ChIPs Network is a nonprofit organization representing more than 7,000 members in 30 regional chapters in North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Africa.
