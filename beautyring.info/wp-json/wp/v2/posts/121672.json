Much of the program will be a Q&amp;A session on a wide range of topics.<\/p>\n<p>Kelly is a New York Times bestselling author, a podcaster and the host of Tell Me More on PBS.  Huffington Post calls her \u201cThe Poet Laureate of the ordinary\u201d and O Magazine dubbed her the \u201cvoice of a generation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Released in 2008, her first memoir, The Middle Place, was about going through cancer treatment simultaneously with her father and her father\u2019s subsequent death.  <\/p>\n<p>The San Francisco Chronicle called The Middle Place \u201cmore complex\u2013and funny\u2013than one would ever imagine.\u201d  That\u2019s a fair assessment of all of Kelly\u2019s work.   When writing, speaking or interviewing, Kelly gets to the heart of the subject in a relatable, amusing and refreshing way.  <\/p>\n<p>On her podcast and TV show, Kelly brings together a diverse list of A-List guests to talk about subjects like grit, character, service, hope and optimism.  These straight-to-the-heart topics will be woven into the June 20 event.  \u201cWe fully anticipate An Evening with Kelly Corrigan to be a conversation that entertains and enriches, \u201c said Lightways\u2019 CEO Mary Kay Sheehan.     <\/p>\n<p>WGN radio personality John Williams will moderate the event. John hosts the midday show on WGN Radio720 as well as several podcasts.  He has recently written and spoken about his experiences caring for his elderly parents.  <\/p>\n<p>As the largest nonprofit hospice in Illinois, Lightways aims this event to be the first in a speaker series providing healthy conversation on death and dying, caretaking and grief.    \u201cGrief affects us all at some point and for so many reasons.  This evening is a perfect opportunity for those grieving&#8211;and those who love people who are grieving&#8211;to get some fresh perspective,\u201d said Sheehan.<\/p>\n<p>Reserved seats are available at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ticketmaster.com\/kelly-corrigan-tickets\/artist\/1706275\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">ticketmaster<\/a>.com or at the Rialto Square box office in person with no handling fee.
