The Company provides no assurances that the sale will be completed on these terms or at all.\u00a0 Additionally, the Company is evaluating the sale of two more hotels, subject to market conditions, to be completed in 2024 and 2025, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The Company also announced today that, by utilizing cash on hand, it has fully repaid the outstanding <span class=\"xn-money\">$30 million<\/span> loan associated with the 143-room Cameo Beverly Hills hotel located in <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles, California<\/span>. \u00a0Over the past several months, the Company has diligently worked through its refinancing program and, subject to the pending sale of Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines, Braemar has refinanced or paid off all of its 2024 debt maturities.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the Company announced plans to redeem <span class=\"xn-money\">$50 million<\/span> of its non-traded preferred and\/or public preferred stock this year, utilizing proceeds from the sale of the Hilton Torrey Pines.\u00a0 Any redeemed preferred stock will no longer be outstanding, and dividends will no longer accrue on such securities.

The timing and amount of any transactions will be subject to the discretion of the Company based upon market conditions, and the program may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company at its discretion without prior notice.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s announcements reflect our commitment to reduce the Company&#8217;s dividend and interest expense, enhance our capital structure and financial flexibility, as well as create value for our shareholders,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Richard J. Stockton<\/span>, Braemar&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;The planned sale of the Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines at an attractive cap rate, demonstrates the high-quality nature of
