The study was jointly supported by The Michael J Fox Foundation and Parkinson\u2019s UK. NLX-112 met the primary endpoint of safety and tolerability, and also met its secondary endpoint of significantly reducing LID. Notably, NLX-112 also elicited robust anti-parkinsonian efficacy, significantly reducing motor impairment in study participants. Taken together, the data point to a groundbreaking dual-acting activity of NLX-112, combining both anti-LID and anti-parkinsonian properties. <\/p>\n<p>\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddff. \ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb \ud835\udde1\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude04\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb-\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf6, CEO of Neurolixis, commented: \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled about the results from this trial. The positive effects seen on both dyskinesia and parkinsonism could make NLX-112 a highly innovative, non-dopaminergic dual efficacy therapy, thanks to its first-in-class neurochemical properties, distinct from those of current medications for Parkinson\u2019s.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The dual efficacy profile of NLX-112 has not been observed for other anti-parkinsonian drugs and may arise from NLX-112\u2019s original mechanism of action. Indeed, whereas levodopa and most other existing antiparkinsonian drugs target the dopamine neurotransmitter system in the brain, NLX-112 targets the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system and specifically 5-HT1A receptors. NLX-112 is exceptionally selective for 5-HT1A receptors and fully activates them, a profile which differentiates it from previous serotonergic drugs and likely underlie the dual-acting clinical benefits seen in the present study. <\/p>\n<p>\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddef\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude01 \ud835\udde3\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf8\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb\u2019\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude03\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddee-\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddf1\ud835\ude06\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf8\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddee<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nParkinson\u2019s disease is the second most prevailing neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer disease, and causes movement impairment, including shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. About 1% of people over the age of 60 are affected and about 10 million people globally, and the incidence of Parkinson\u2019s is rising with the aging of the population. The mainstay drug for treatment of Parkinson\u2019s is levodopa, which limits motor dysfunction in the early stages of the disease. However, after prolonged treatment it can cause involuntary movements called dyskinesia. Up to 80 percent of people with Parkinson&#8217;s will experience LID after ten years of taking levodopa. The main medication available to manage dyskinesia is amantadine, which can have challenging side-effects and does not work for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddef\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\udde1\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\udfed\ud835\udfed\ud835\udfee \ud835\udde3\ud835\uddf5\ud835\udfee\ud835\uddd4 \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf1\ud835\ude06<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05148884) was conducted at 5 centers in Sweden and enrolled 27 subjects with troubling LID. Subjects were maintained on a stable dose of levodopa and other anti-parkinsonian medications. Study drug dosing was up-titrated over 4 weeks to a maximum of 2 mg\/day (1 mg b.i.d.); dosing was kept stable for 2 weeks (until day 42) and then down-titrated over 2 weeks. Subjects received a levodopa challenge (150 % of regular dose) at baseline and at the end of the up-titration and steady-state periods. Dyskinesia and parkinsonism were assessed using the Unified Dyskinesia rating Scale (UDysRS) and the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), respectively.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n22 patients (15 on NLX-112, 7 on PBO) completed the 8-week treatment according to the protocol. Safety and tolerability were similar between the NLX-112 and placebo groups. In motor assessment measures at day 42, NLX-112 significantly reduced UDysRS total score (p=0.0016) and parts 3+4 objective evaluation scores (p=0.0005), whereas placebo group changes were not significant. Moreover, NLX-112 also significantly reduced UPDRS total score (p=0.0021) and part 3 motor impairment score (p=0.0072), whereas placebo group changes were not significant.<\/p>\n<p>\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddef\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude01 \ud835\udde1\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude05\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00 <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nNeurolixis is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and early development of novel drugs for the treatment of central nervous system disorders with unmet medical needs and sizeable market opportunity, including movement disorders, autism, pain and depression. The Neurolixis drug candidates are serotonin 5 HT1A receptor \u2018biased agonists\u2019 which enables them to better target specific brain regions controlling CNS disorders. NLX-112 has previously shown favorable safety and tolerance in over 600 subjects during Ph1 and Ph2 trials for other indications. NLX-112 is also under study as a potential treatment for other motor disorders such as spinocerebellar ataxia and essential tremor. Other drug candidates in the Neurolixis pipeline are NLX-101, which is in clinical Phase 1 for treatment of rare autism spectrum disorders (Rett syndrome and Fragile X syndrome), and NLX-204, a preclinical candidate for treatment of pain and mood deficits.<\/p>\n<p>For more information, contact Pim Cerutti, Liberi Group Life Science Business Development &amp; Strategy; pimcerutti@LiberiGroup.com<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">PIM CERUTTI<br \/>LIBERI GROUP<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/648007202\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/neurolixis-inc-\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=gACt2-kPwyMhnyl9&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      August 22, 2023, 04:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/648007202\/dual-clinical-efficacy-of-nlx-112-in-parkinson-s-disease-presented-at-scientific-meetings\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"channels\" dir=\"auto\">\n        Distribution channels:<br \/>\n        <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/beauty-hair-care\" title=\"Beauty &amp; Hair Care Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Beauty &amp; Hair Care<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/business-economy\" title=\"Business &amp; Economy Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Business &amp; Economy<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/chemicals\" title=\"Chemical Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Chemical Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/companies\" title=\"Companies Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Companies<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/conferences-trade-fairs\" title=\"Conferences &amp; Trade Fairs Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Conferences &amp; Trade Fairs<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/consumer-goods\" title=\"Consumer Goods Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Consumer Goods<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/culture-society-lifestyle\" title=\"Culture, Society &amp; Lifestyle Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Culture, Society &amp; Lifestyle<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/healthcare-pharmaceuticals\" title=\"Healthcare &amp; Pharmaceuticals Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Healthcare &amp; Pharmaceuticals Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/science\" title=\"Science Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Science<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/sports-fitness-recreation\" title=\"Sports, Fitness &amp; Recreation Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Sports, Fitness &amp; Recreation<\/a><br \/>\n        &#8230;\n      <\/div>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
