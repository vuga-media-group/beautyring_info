The Axle Tags AI\/ML engines \u2013 automatic face recognition, object recognition, logo recognition and speech transcription \u2013 have made Axle AI the leading AI-powered MAM. With Axle AI&#8217;s browser interface, users can easily search, manage, and repurpose their media assets, and even launch collaborative edit sessions through the Axledit cloud application, all with complete remote access capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>OpenDrives&#8217; Atlas Core platform provides a high-performance storage backbone that complements Axle AI&#8217;s capabilities perfectly. Leveraging OpenDrives&#8217; processing power, Axle AI runs its containerized server application modules directly on the OpenDrives platform, bringing the MAM application closer to the target data and accelerating critical media workflows. The containerized approach enables throughput that is nearly 100 times faster than traditional 10 Gigabit Ethernet-based solutions, making core functions of Axle AI such as file system scanning, metadata extraction, proxy generation, and AI\/ML analysis significantly faster and more efficient.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;By integrating Axle AI&#8217;s media processing engines as containers on the OpenDrives platform, we have achieved unprecedented levels of performance and throughput,&#8221; said Sam Bogoch, CEO of Axle AI. &#8220;This means that content producers can now search, manage, and repurpose their media assets in near-real time, making their creative workflows more efficient and productive than ever before.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In addition to its performance benefits, OpenDrives&#8217; Atlas Core platform is built on open standards and protocols, facilitating interoperability with other technologies. This enables seamless integration with popular video editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, Apple Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Avid Media Composer, as well as media archiving platforms like Archiware P5 and Spectra Logic&#8217;s Black Pearl, making Axle AI a perfect fit within the OpenDrives ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>The Axle AI and OpenDrives solution is designed to meet the needs of modern media and entertainment workflows, where efficient media asset management is crucial for productivity.
