The market is categorized based on products, including ampoules, bottles, vials, syringes, and cartridges. Vials, known for their excellent analytical performance and sustainability, are expected to exhibit the second-fastest growth rate after ampoules. The vials segment is projected to increase its market share, rising from 33.3% in 2023.<\/p>\n<p>Vials, typically made from Type 1 borosilicate glass, offer desirable chemical resistance properties. The ampoules segment is anticipated to experience the fastest growth, while bottles are expected to maintain the largest market share, constituting over 75.0% in terms of volume in 2023. Bottles are preferred for their superior analytical performance and suitability for various applications.<\/p>\n<p>Glass bottles used in pharmaceutical packaging are further divided into two categories based on size \u2013 small bottles and large bottles. Large-size glass bottles are utilized for packaging reagents, transfusion, and infusion bottles, while small glass bottles are employed for packaging syrup and other oral liquids. The small-sized bottle segment is predicted to grow, driven by opportunities such as the increased consumption of oral tablets packaged in small bottles.<\/p>\n<p>Ampoules, primarily made from glass, are expected to register the most attractive Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in terms of revenue during the forecast period from 2023 to 2030. This is attributed to glass&#8217;s ability to filter specific wavelengths, along with its high microbiological control and chemical resistance. A significant number of ampoules are manufactured in compliance with the DIN ISO EN 9187-1\/2 standard, featuring sealed designs, funnel-type, and straight-stem configurations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Drug Type Insights:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In 2023, the generic drug category dominated the market, contributing more than 72.9% to the global revenue. The surge in the global generic drug market is attributed to the rising incidence of chronic diseases, an aging population, and the expiration of drug patents.<\/p>\n<p>Government and healthcare initiatives to curtail healthcare expenditure, lower drug prices, and expand health insurance coverage are additional factors expected to drive the demand for generic drugs. The increasing adoption of generic drugs is likely to boost the demand for pharmaceutical glass packaging due to its regulatory compliance and exceptional barrier properties.<\/p>\n<p>Biologic drugs are experiencing growth, primarily due to their effectiveness in treating major chronic diseases, especially certain autoimmune conditions and cancer. However, challenges such as glass delamination and chipping resulting from surface degradation may hinder the growth of primary glass packaging for biologic drugs.<\/p>\n<p>In North America, the generic drug segment is projected to exhibit higher growth than the branded segment in both volume and revenue. The affordability of generic drugs is a key factor contributing to this trend, while the patent expirations in the branded segment are expected to lead to moderate growth over the forecast period. The primary glass packaging segment is anticipated to experience sluggish growth due to reduced volume sales of branded drugs.<\/p>\n<p>Biologics are expected to significantly benefit the pharmaceutical industry by addressing underserved therapeutic aspects. The biosimilar competition for biologics remains moderate, resulting in steady growth for this segment. The United States, with its presence of pharmaceutical giants, is anticipated to remain a core region for various pharmaceutical glass packaging activities.<\/p>\n<p>Increased customer consolidation and heightened competitive intensity in the U.S. are predicted to lead to a substantial rise in generic drug sales volume, contributing to a rapid shift in market dynamics. This shift, coupled with the expiration of patents for several drugs, is expected to constrain sales of branded products in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recent Developments:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In June 2023, SDG SA revealed a collaboration with Corning Incorporated to establish a glass tubing facility in Telangana, India. This strategic partnership leverages SDG&#8217;s expertise and Corning&#8217;s glass coating technology to boost fine-line productivity, marking a significant expansion in pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>By May 2023, Bormioli Pharma S.p.A had extended its partnership with Desall.com to foster innovation in pharmaceutical packaging. The focus of this collaboration was on exploring augmented reality solutions for drug delivery and biometric recognition solutions to revolutionize child-resistant closure systems.<\/p>\n<p>March 2023 saw Schott AG initiating the production of FIOLAX\u00aeamber pharma glass in India to meet the growing demand in Asia. This move aimed to enhance reliability, planning, availability, and cost-efficiency for pharmaceutical converters.<\/p>\n<p>Collaborating in October 2022, Gerresheimer AG and Merck developed a digitalized twin solution to ensure trust and traceability in the pharmaceutical supply chain. This innovative solution creates a digital representation of packaging for syringes and vials.<\/p>\n<p>In January 2022, West Pharmaceutical Services Inc. joined forces with Corning to advance drug delivery and containment through the development of cutting-edge pharmaceutical packaging solutions.<\/p>\n<p>Expanding its presence in the European market, Nipro Corporation acquired all shares of Piramida d.o.o in May 2021.
