Make sure to bring along familiar items such as their favorite bedding and toys.<\/li>\n<li><b>In Good Health: <\/b>Make sure your dog is healthy and up-to-date on vaccinations and ask your veterinarian whether additional vaccines or parasite prevention are recommended due to different exposure risks at your vacation destination. Have your veterinarian&#8217;s contact information handy and know the location of the closest emergency veterinarian in the area where you are traveling.<\/li>\n<li><b>Consistency Is Key<\/b>: Try to incorporate your normal routine as much as possible. This could be feeding and taking them outside at similar times of day, taking their favorite afternoon walk, or keeping time for snuggles in the morning. Some consistency goes a long way in keeping your pet comfortable in new surroundings.<\/li>\n<li><b>Be Prepared to Pivot:<\/b> Consider your pet&#8217;s personality and state of health before deciding to bring them with you. If the trip will involve activities where they can&#8217;t participate or if the pet is unlikely to enjoy the journey, it may be best to hire a pet sitter or use a boarding service.<\/li>\n<li><b>Have Good Pet Etiquette:<\/b> For your pet&#8217;s safety and the sake of others, always keep pets on a leash in public areas, never leave them unattended in the hotel rooms for long periods and ensure they don&#8217;t disturb other guests.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The AVMA has additional valuable pet information at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3928946-1&amp;h=2778679113&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avma.org%2F&amp;a=AVMA.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">AVMA.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>SOURCE American Veterinary Medical Association<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/rt.prnewswire.com\/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH67376&amp;Transmission_Id=202307270800PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH67376&amp;DateId=20230727\" style=\"border:0px; width:1px; height:1px;\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Originally published at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/american-veterinary-medical-associations-advice-for-sharing-hotel-rooms-with-pets-301886242.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer sponsored\">https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/american-veterinary-medical-associations-advice-for-sharing-hotel-rooms-with-pets-301886242.html<\/a><br \/>\n<font size=\"-1\"><em>Images courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/pixabay.com<\/a><\/em><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SCHAUMBURG, Ill., July 27, 2023 \/PRNewswire\/ &#8212; Over the years, the hospitality industry has addressed the important role pets play in our lives by increasing the number of animal-friendly hotels.
