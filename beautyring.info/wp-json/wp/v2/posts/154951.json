His story remains largely unknown and untold in the United States, yet his influence on American culture and history surpasses that of any other African in American history.<\/p>\n<p>You can explore the Orange Mound to Africa Initiative by visiting the website <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.orangemoundtoafrica.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.orangemoundtoafrica.com<\/a>. This initiative connects Orange Mound, a historic Black community in Memphis\u2014the first neighborhood built for Blacks by Blacks in America\u2014with Africa, Kennedy, King, Kenya, and Obama.<\/p>\n<p>The estimated distance between Memphis and Kenya is approximately 8,266 miles, highlighting the remarkable connection between Orange Mound and the African continent.<\/p>\n<p>In 1990, the Black 1988 Memphis produced film  The Contemporary Gladiator premiered in Nairobi, Kenya. The Kenyan government extended a hero\u2019s welcome to film producer Anthony Elmore film star and cast members, sponsoring a luxurious safari. It was an incredible experience for Blacks men who had produced and associated with the  film to be honored in Kenya.<\/p>\n<p>Film producer Elmore notes &#8220;I vividly remember being in a safari tent, tears streaming down my face. I was part of the first generation of Africans returning to our ancestral homeland. An encounter with what an African described as \u2018Ancestral Spirits\u2019 profoundly touched me. From that moment, my life\u2019s purpose became uniting Africans and African Americans and telling how wonderful an experience it is visiting Africa. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In 1953, an organization called ACOA (American Committee on Africa) was formed in America. Its founders were George Houser, a White man who was also one of the founding member of C.O.R.E. or the Congress of Racial Equality, and Bayard Rustin, an African\/America man. For history enthusiasts, on November 3, 2023, a film titled Rustin premiered in American movie theaters. Bayard Rustin one of the founders of ACOA is also , the organizer of the 1963 March on Washington,  where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered the iconic I Have a Dream\u2019 speech. <\/p>\n<p>It was ACOA that  sponsored 26-year-old Tom Mboya to come to America. Tom Mboya was unlike any African, Americans had seen before\u2014handsome, educated, and articulate. His goal was to advocate for the freedom from colonization of his people in Africa. Hailing from \u2018British East Africa,\u2019that became Kenya in 1963 Mboya fought and spoke  against colonization.<\/p>\n<p>Through ACOA, Mboya embarked on speaking tours addressing the Kenya  question. He could speak for hours without notes, urging colleges to grant scholarships to African students. Remarkably, while African Americans faced strict Jim Crow laws preventing them from attending White schools, African students were considered foreign and could attend White colleges. Tom Mboya played a pivotal role in integrating liberal White colleges in America with African students.<\/p>\n<p>By 1959, Mboya had secured so many scholarships for African students that they needed to charter an airplane to bring them to America. To raise funds, Baseball Great Jackie Robinson, Actor Sidney Poitier, and Singer Harry Belafonte lent their names to a letter, launching the Mboya Airlift America plan.<\/p>\n<p>Among the beneficiaries of this plan was the  23-year-old Kenya  student who went to college in Hawaii  on the Jackie Robinson Scholarship named Barack Obama Sr. the father of former American President Barack Obama Jr.<\/p>\n<p>Tom Mboya emerged as the de facto African leader and spokesperson. He graced the covers of Jet and time magazines and received an honorary Doctorate Degree from prestigious Howard University in 1959.<\/p>\n<p>On May 13, 1959, Tom Mboya was honored at an African Freedom dinner at Atlanta University. Dr. Martin Luther King, speaking at the dinner, reminded us: \u2018Our struggle is not an isolated one; we are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality.\u2019&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In July 1960, the Airlift America program had gained so much popularity in the United States. An urgent need for support arose, prompting Tom Mboya to seek assistance from Presidential Candidate Richard Nixon. However, Nixon declined to help.<\/p>\n<p>While in Kenya a crisis was happening .  Airlift America had gained so many scholarship that another charter plane was needed to carry the Kenya students to America.  There was no money for airfare to get the Kenyans to America.  There was one last hope  A meeting was arranged for Mboya  meet with Senator John F. Kennedy, who was running as for the Democratic presidential nominee whose father had a lot of money.  Mboya rushed to America to meet with Kennedy at   On July 26, 1960, at the Kennedy Compound.  Mboya emphasized to Kennedy the importance of education for Africans.<\/p>\n<p>Senator Kennedy acknowledged the significance of education and initially agreed to provide $10,000. Later, he announced that the Kennedy Foundation would contribute $20,000. As the conversation continued, Kennedy committed not only $100,000 for transportation but also an additional $100,000 for expenses, with the condition that the donation remain anonymous. <\/p>\n<p>Despite being a Democrat and part of the Southern White conservative Democrats, Kennedy\u2019s support for African education did not favor well with the democratic party.   His opponent Nixon alleged that he aimed to influence the Black vote via assisting African students.  The event lead to a full blown investigation that Kenney was trying to buy Black votes.   However, it was clear that Kennedy genuinely wanted to assist African students.  Moreover Kennedy won the endorsement of singer Harry Belafonte.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C21r3qfRk4Y\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Click here see 1960 add Harry Belafonte Campaigning for President Kennedy.<\/a> Please note Blacks were Republican part of the Lincoln Party.  Harry Belafonte was the most popular Black Singer in America at that time and it was historic for Blacks to support democrats.  It was President John F. Kennedy who changed Blacks from Republican to democrat. <\/p>\n<p>The 1960 presidential race between Kennedy and Nixon was extremely close, and the shift in Black voters from Republican to Democrat played a pivotal role. Richard Nixon was so concerned about this impact that he asked Tom Mboya to decline Kennedy\u2019s financial support, suggesting that the State Department would fund Kenyan students instead.  Unknown and untold it was Tom Mboya who influenced  America&#8217;s 1960 Presidential election.<\/p>\n<p>The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum website reads: &#8220;At a key point in the 1960 presidential campaign, a dynamic young leader from Kenya named Tom Mboya visited Senator John F. Kennedy. Mboya led a campaign of his own that would eventually bring hundreds of African students to America for higher education, including Barack Obama Sr., President Obama&#8217;s father. Kennedy&#8217;s decision to support the effort became an issue in the election and possibly a factor in his narrow victory.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>From 1960 until 1963 Tom Mboya with the help of future Black  supreme court Justice Thurgood Marshall attended the  Lancaster House Conferences took place in London for negotiations of Self-Rule&#8221; whereas Thurgood Marshall would draft Kenya&#8217;s constitution  for the new Independent  nation that would be called Kenya.<\/p>\n<p>Just 20, days  before Kenya would become a nation John F. Kennedy would be assassinated on November 22, 1963.   Kenya became an official nation December 12, 1963. <\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DcFPmgbFYBI\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Click here  Amp Video Kenya&#8217;s Birth Part of American Civil Rights  Movement<\/a>.
