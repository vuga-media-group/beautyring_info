Contrary to publicly traded companies, these investments are not listed on stock exchanges. Private equity firms deploy these funds to purchase a significant portion or the entirety of a company, aiming to enhance its value over time through active management strategies. They work closely with the management of the acquired company, implementing operational improvements, strategic changes, and growth initiatives to maximize its performance and ultimately generate returns for investors. Private equity spans various stages of businesses, from startups to established companies, and often involves restructuring expansion, or turnaround efforts to unlock the full potential of the company before exiting the investment through avenues such as IPOs or sales.<\/p>\n<p>Prime determinants of growth<\/p>\n<p>The private equity market is expected to witness notable growth owing to the potential for higher returns, access to specialized expertise and networks, and flexibility in investment strategies. Moreover, the opportunity for ESG integration is expected to provide a lucrative opportunity for the growth of the market during the forecast period. On the contrary, regulatory and compliance challenges and limited liquidity and exit options limit the growth of the private equity market.<br \/>COVID-19 Scenario<\/p>\n<p>COVID-19 had a mixed impact on the private equity market. Initially, there was a downturn as uncertainty and market volatility surged, leading to deal postponements and valuation challenges.<br \/>However, as the economy stabilized and rebounded, the market saw increased opportunities for distressed asset acquisitions at attractive valuations. Sectors like technology, healthcare, and e-commerce experienced growth, bolstering the performance of certain private equity portfolios.<br \/>Overall, while the pandemic initially posed challenges, it also created avenues for strategic investments and lucrative opportunities, resulting in a mixed impact on the private equity landscape.<\/p>\n<p>Request Customization: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/request-for-customization\/7314\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/request-for-customization\/7314<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The buyout segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period<\/p>\n<p>Based on fund type, the buyout segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for nearly one-third of the global private equity market revenue and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period.

However, the infrastructure segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 13.3% from 2023 to 2032. This is due to the global shifts toward sustainable development, increased demand for modern infrastructure, and the focus on renewable energy solutions. Infrastructure investments address critical needs for energy transition, transportation upgrades, and technological advancements, attracting private equity due to long-term revenue potential and the essential nature of these projects.<\/p>\n<p>The technology segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period<\/p>\n<p>On the basis of sector, the technology segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for more than one-fourth of the global private equity market revenue.
