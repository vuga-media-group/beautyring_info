He was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps through the Platoon Leaders Class in 1988 and attended The Basic School in Quantico, Virginia. <\/p>\n<p>He completed flight training in Pensacola, Florida and trained to fly the Cobra at Camp Pendleton, California before reporting to the &#8220;Gunrunners&#8221; of Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 269 at New River, North Carolina, where he earned his qualifications to fly the SuperCobra. <\/p>\n<p>Eric completed multiple deployments throughout the Persian Gulf, Norway, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia along with graduating from the Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Course. He then deployed with Amphibious Task Force \u2013 East in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. It was this deployment that gave him the inspiration for his first book Ghosts of Baghdad. <\/p>\n<p>In 2004, Eric reported back to Camp Pendleton, California, and assumed command of the &#8220;Coyotes&#8221;. While commanding the &#8220;Coyotes&#8221; he deployed into the heart of the Sunni Triangle in 2004 and again in 2005, stationed just miles between the flashpoint cities of Fallujah and Ramadi. From their base at Al Taqaddum, he and every \u201cCoyote\u201d flew combat missions in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. These deployments are the backdrop for his next book, Devil in the Triangle, which is expected to be released in the fall of 2024.<\/p>\n<p>In 2007, after graduating from the Marine Corps War College, Eric was assigned to the Joint Staff J-7, in Washington, D.C.
