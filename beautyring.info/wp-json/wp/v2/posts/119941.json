The Artist serves as a key collaboration in the festival theme, bringing new ideas to the Blue Water Film Festival. In keeping with Blue Water Film Festival \u2018Artists For The Oceans\u2019, Blue Water\u2019s film selections, along with the rest of the Blue Water lineup, will be announced on April 22nd. <br \/>\n\u201cThe Featured Artist program is one of the key and important parts of our festival,\u201d said Blue Water Film Festival Executive Director Greg Reitman. \u201cMarsel is an incredible photographer whose body of work has been published around the globe. His artistic eye and visual tapestry for wildlife and the oceans makes for a remarkable visual presentation for our 4th annual official movie poster.\u201d <br \/>\nArtist Marsel van Oosten is a nature lover with a deep concern for the natural world. In his work, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. \u201cI\u2019m honored to have my piece chosen to represent this year\u2019s festival,\u201d says Marsel van Oosten. \u201cSuccessful conservation starts with awareness. I hope that my images will make people aware that Mother Earth needs our protection and inspire them to take action.\u201d <br \/>\nHis images have won many awards around the globe and he is the world\u2019s only photographer to have won the Grand Slam: the grand titles Wildlife Photographer of the Year, International Nature Photographer of the Year, and Travel Photographer of the Year. Marsel\u2019s images are featured in galleries and museums and used worldwide in advertising and design. He is a regular contributor to National Geographic and a Nikon brand ambassador. His latest book is called MOTHER \u2014 A Tribute To Mother Earth. <br \/>\n\u201cSocial media is a great tool for accessing information and images.
