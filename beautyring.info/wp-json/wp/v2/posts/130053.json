Two Brazilian authors launched their books, among them was the award-winning actor Suzana Pires. The event took place on August 19th at the Barnes &amp; Noble at The Grove in Los Angeles, attracting a diverse audience eager to celebrate Latina literature and culture.<\/p>\n<p>The panel, thoughtfully moderated by renowned journalist Vera Jimenez, brought together a group of talented immigrant authors to discuss their literary journeys, share insights, and connect with the audience. The authors Suzana Pires and Michelle Galluff were present to discuss their writing journey in a second language, as well as their immigration journey. Both are launching books with WeBook, available  at Barnes &amp; Noble, Amazon, and soon at Target online. <\/p>\n<p>WeBook Publishing believes in the power of storytelling to shape perceptions and create understanding. The Authors Panel was a testament to this belief, featuring a diverse range of authors who shared their unique perspectives and experiences through their literary works. Participants had the opportunity to gain valuable insights into the challenges and triumphs faced by these talented individuals, underscoring the importance of representation and the celebration of Latina voices in literature.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cIt&#8217;s an emotional experience when you can see, taste and touch your dream and know that other people are making their own dreams come true because you had the courage to go and do it, and bring them alongside you\u201d, says Ana Silvani, owner of WeBook. \u201cThis was a seed that I planted and at this event, it turned into something beautiful!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>WeBook Publishing extends its heartfelt gratitude to Barnes &amp; Noble at The Grove for hosting, once again this momentous event and providing a platform for new voices to be heard. The publishing house remains committed to promoting stories that challenge stereotypes, inspire empathy, and build bridges across cultures. The success of the Authors Panel serves as a testament to the ever-increasing demand for inclusive literature and the need for platforms that elevate these voices in the publishing industry.<\/p>\n<p>The panel concluded with a book signing, cocktail hour, and the exchange of many ideas, stories, and new book proposals for 2024.
