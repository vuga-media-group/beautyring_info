Medical emergencies occur when the body\u2019s temperature rises to dangerous levels and the body becomes unable to lower its temperature.  Bodily damage, which can be fatal, occurs if steps are not taken to lower body temperature.  One study found that taking psychiatric drugs <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamainternalmedicine\/fullarticle\/413470\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">nearly doubled<\/a> the risk of death during a heat wave.<\/p>\n<p>The elderly are even more susceptible to the risk of heat-related illness.  The body\u2019s temperature regulation is generally slower in older adults.  Compared to young people, older adults also sweat less and radiate less heat, so the core body temperature rises more easily.  The rate of hospitalization for heat stroke is significantly higher for older adults and their hospital stays are longer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn special risk situations such as heat waves, the risk\/benefit ratio of psychotropic drugs which could <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/17513091\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">interfere<\/a> with body temperature regulation has to be carefully assessed, particularly in the elderly,\u201d concluded French researchers, led by Karin Martin-Latry, PharmD, PhD, in a study published in European Psychiatry.<\/p>\n<p>How many people taking psychiatric drugs end up with heat-related medical emergencies?  Nobody knows.  <\/p>\n<p>\u201cDue to the lack of research in the field, it is impossible to estimate the scale of the problem\u201d of the interaction between drugs and heat, Ying Zhang, senior lecturer at the University of Sydney\u2019s School of Public Health, told the Washington Post. [1]<\/p>\n<p>During periods of extreme heat, those taking antipsychotic drugs are at particular risk of heat stroke.  Antipsychotics reduce sweating, the body\u2019s natural means of cooling, as well as reduce the users\u2019 behavior to cool themselves, like drinking more water or removing extra clothing.  Even a short time in very hot weather can cause a rapid rise in body temperature for people on these drugs. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cPatients who are prescribed antipsychotics should be aware of the potentially fatal adverse events that can occur from these medications,\u201d warned doctors in a recently published case report on antipsychotic drug-induced hyperthermia. [2]<\/p>\n<p>Stimulant drugs, like ADHD drugs, are known to raise body temperature, as well as interfere with the body\u2019s ability to cool itself down.  High summer temperatures can cause body temperatures that are already elevated by these drugs to go higher still.<\/p>\n<p>Tricyclic antidepressants decrease sweating, along with inhibiting the body\u2019s ability to regulate temperature, which can result in body temperature rising to dangerous levels during summer heat waves.  <\/p>\n<p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants can increase sweating while at the same time reducing thirst, which can lead to dehydration and heat illness in very hot weather.<\/p>\n<p>Those taking psychiatric drugs should limit their exposure to summer heat and strenuous activity and drink plenty of water.  Seek immediate medical attention for anyone showing signs of heat stroke, including confusion, unconsciousness, a rapid pulse, a high temperature, or red, hot, dry skin.<\/p>\n<p>The Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) continues to raise public awareness of the risks of serious side effects from psychiatric drugs, so that consumers and their physicians can make fully informed decisions about starting or stopping the drugs. <\/p>\n<p>CCHR recommends a complete physical examination with lab tests, nutritional and allergy screenings, and a review of all current medications to identify any physical causes of unwanted mental or behavioral symptoms, which might otherwise be misdiagnosed as a psychiatric disorder and incorrectly treated.<\/p>\n<p>WARNING: Anyone wishing to discontinue or change the dose of a psychiatric drug is cautioned to do so only under the supervision of a physician because of potentially dangerous withdrawal symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>The Citizens Commission on Human Rights was co-founded in 1969 by members of the Church of Scientology and the late psychiatrist and humanitarian Thomas Szasz, M.D., recognized by many academics as modern psychiatry\u2019s most authoritative critic, to eradicate abuses and restore human rights and dignity to the field of mental health.  CCHR has been instrumental in obtaining 228 laws against psychiatric abuse and violations of human rights worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>The CCHR National Affairs Office in Washington, DC, has advocated for mental health rights and protections at the state and federal level.  The CCHR traveling exhibit, which has toured 441 major cities worldwide and educated over 800,000 people on the history to the present day of abusive and racist psychiatric practices, has been displayed at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Annual Legislative Conference in Washington, DC, and at other locations.<\/p>\n<p>[1] <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/health\/risks-for-some-medications-rise-as-temperatures-climb\/2020\/06\/25\/0ba887e4-ae90-11ea-856d-5054296735e5_story.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/health\/risks-for-some-medications-rise-as-temperatures-climb\/2020\/06\/25\/0ba887e4-ae90-11ea-856d-5054296735e5_story.html<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n[2] <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/34659926\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/34659926<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Anne Goedeke<br \/>Citizens Commission on Human Rights, National Affairs Office<br \/>+1 202-349-9267<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/641996052\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">CCHR: Psychiatric Drug Side Effects<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"tlR4pntJboI\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"CCHR: Psychiatric Drugs Side Effects\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tlR4pntJboI?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;
