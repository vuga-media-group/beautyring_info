The indie-rock band will give a sneak preview of the record played live in its entirety along with some extras, all while being hosted by one of Milquetoast &amp; Co.&#8217;s favorite venues in Denver \u2014 at Dazzle&#8217;s new location at 1080 14th Street. <\/p>\n<p>The band&#8217;s eclectic sound \u2014 brought to life by lead singer-songwriter\/guitarist and producer McAndrew\u2019s emotive vocals and wry, witty, sometimes wistful storytelling; co-producer Dan Zangari\u2019s bass lines; Kyle Bocchieri\u2019s drum work; Joe Engel\u2019s cello technique and rich tone, and Ben Parrish\u2019s guitar style \u2014 will be accompanied by additional horns and string section to deliver as authentic a performance as possible. Milquetoast &amp; Co. is also extremely excited to feature the talented singer\/songwriter Lauren Frihauf who will not only open the show but perform the album with them as well.

The flavorful ten-track offerings on the album are abundantly self-aware and ironic without watering down the complexity of the human experience. To track the new songs, the band flew to California to record the project at Invisible Island Studio with Owner\/Engineer Kevin Ratterman (My Morning Jacket, Afghan Whigs, Ray LaMontagne, Flaming Lips). Milquetoast &amp; Co. was also very fortunate to have Mastering Engineer Nathan James (Sting, Pitbull, The Fray, Staind) put the touches on the record.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The album&#8217;s title &#8216;Run Rant Rave&#8217; is a bit tongue and cheek so to speak. In a time where every other person seems to view themselves as a social justice warrior, I thought the title was apropos,&#8221; says McAndrew. &#8220;I wanted to have something that was a little more accountable to self both musically and lyrically; it&#8217;s a little more subdued and self-reflective. Accountability seems to be lacking in the world, where people seem to be a lot more willing to point fingers at others instead of looking at their own actions and contributing to the &#8216;whole.'&#8221;  <\/p>\n<p>At Ratterman\u2019s studio in Alhambra, just northeast of Los Angeles, the band also brought in some additional musicians to broaden the musical palette on the record: They invited Eric Gorfain, and the Section Quartet, a renowned string quartet, who has worked with Foo Fighters, Nick Cave and Queens of the Stone Age along with many top artists and producers, to play on half of the tracks on &#8220;Run Rant Rave.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/artist\/0sLhpspCXTMUkeixeD9jEq\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LISTEN TO MILQUETOAST &amp; CO. NOW.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Milquetoast &amp; Co. released the lead single \u201cSpinning\u201d in Spring, and prior to that, a cover of Kate Bush\u2019s \u201cArmy Dreamers,\u201d which hit Telluride KOTO-FM\u2019s airwaves; was spun on ten more radio stations throughout Colorado; and featured on Boulder AAA station KBCO-FM&#8217;s website and Instagram stories. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8216;Spinning&#8217; is important to me lyrically because it speaks to the confusion that sets in through our early lives. Ultimately some people evolve from those life experiences and some people refuse to move forward.  Sonically, the song counters the layered messages; I picture Don Quixote and Sancho Panzo riding off into the sunset, forgetting what they made the trip for in the first place; yet at peace with the journey regardless,&#8221; explains McAndrew. &#8220;It sounds more like a life song rather than a love song to me.  The horn bridges get me every time.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>The band followed up with a brilliant cover of The Moody Blues&#8217; &#8220;Nights in White Satin;&#8221; the jaunty &#8220;The Good Line,&#8221; &#8220;Tempest,&#8221; and the current symphonic single &#8220;Phantoms,&#8221; which also features Lauren Frihauf&#8217;s haunting vocals. <\/p>\n<p>Recently, Milquetoast &amp; Co. was featured on KRFC-FM (Fort Collins\/Boulder\/Denver) on September 25th from Noon-1pm on &#8220;Locally Sourced,&#8221; on the podcast &#8220;Backstage Jazz&#8221; with host Steve Roby on October 18th, and the band headlined the renowned Historic Stanley Hotel&#8217;s annual Halloween Masquerade Ball on October 28 in Estes Park. In June, Milquetoast &amp; Co. graced the cover of Bandwagon Magazine\u2019s June issue, and was also covered by Denver Westword.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about &#8220;Run Rant Rave,&#8221; Milquetoast &amp; Co.  and more, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.milquetoastandco.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">please visit www.milquetoastandco.com.<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Nathalie Baret<br \/>Win-Win PR &amp; Artist Management<br \/>+1 310-803-3309<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/663678755\/mailto:publicity@win-winpublicityhouse.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">publicity@win-winpublicityhouse.com<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/milquetoastmen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/milquetoastmen\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@MLQtoast\/videos\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">The normal Milquetoast crew (James McAndrew, Dan Zangari, Kyle Bocchieri, Joseph Engel, Ben Parrish) will be accompanied by additional horns and string section.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"4-k1r6uIgaQ\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Milquetoast &amp; Co. - Record Release Show on 11.11\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/4-k1r6uIgaQ?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=vVqAiyBO_7E4jbeI&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      November 09, 2023, 20:15 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/663678755\/milquetoast-co-album-release-with-lauren-frihauf-tomorrow-11-11-23-at-dazzle-denver\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
