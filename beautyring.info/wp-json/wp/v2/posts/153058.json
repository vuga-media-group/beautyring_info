Each original Art of Drag artwork features a beautylicious Drag Queen, created by an award-winning independent art house of LGBTQ+ artists and allies. These works reimagine and subvert famous artworks and genres, from street art to the Renaissance \u2013 and everything in between. It\u2019s a brilliant concept that has an enormous appeal to a core market of young adults, but that also boasts a strong secondary market among teens and tweens, for whom drag is now very much part of mainstream British pop culture.<\/p>\n<p>About The London Studio<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe London Studio is an art licensing and design studio specializing in designing top-selling products for retail, developing commercially successful brands, and developing creative work for clients including celebrities, international retail chains, blue-chip corporations and charities.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Rachel Clinesmith<br \/>Vampyre Cosmetics LLc<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/718660907\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=zv-z0rKQvyXMyINs&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      June 10, 2024, 11:42 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/718660907\/vampyre-cosmetics-and-art-of-drag-makeup-collection\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
