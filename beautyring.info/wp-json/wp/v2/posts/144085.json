The outright honor of amassing this awesome roster of authors cannot be overstated. I love each and every last one of these books and I can&#8217;t wait to shout about how terrifying they are all summer long.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Each year, three titles are selected in each of three categories: Adult, Young Adult, and Middle Grade. For 2024 those selected titles are:<\/p>\n<p>Adult Selections:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nJackal by Erin E. Adams (Bantam, 2022)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSuch Sharp Teeth by Rachel Harrison (Berkley, 2022)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThis Thing Between Us by Gus Moreno (MCD x FSG Originals, 2021)<\/p>\n<p>Young Adult Selections:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAll These Bodies by Kendare Blake (Quill Tree Books, 2021)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDead Flip by Sara Farizan (Algonquin Young Readers, 2022)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n#MurderTrending by Gretchen McNeil (Freeform, 2018)<\/p>\n<p>Middle Grade Selections:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nOphie\u2019s Ghosts by Justina Ireland (Balzer + Bray, 2021)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe Nest by Kenneth Oppel (Simon &amp; Schuster Books for Young Readers, 2015)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMy Aunt Is A Monster by Reimena Yee (Random House Graphic, 2022)<\/p>\n<p>The goal of Summer Scares is to introduce Horror titles to school and public library workers in order to help them start conversations with readers that will extend beyond the books from each list and promote reading for years to come. In addition to the annual list of recommended titles, the Summer Scares Programming Guide, created each year by the Springfield-Greene County (MO) Library\u2013and free for libraries anywhere to access, is back with the tools libraries need to connect with their patrons. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe 2024 guide is packed with ideas that library workers can use to engage their communities with these great titles, whether they&#8217;re putting up book displays, hosting author events, or planning an entire Summer Scares program series,\u201d states Konrad Stump, co-creator of the programming guide. The guide will be available beginning March 1, 2024 on the Summer Scares Resource page at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/raforallhorror.blogspot.com\/p\/summer-scares.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/raforallhorror.blogspot.com\/p\/summer-scares.html<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Along with the guide, the Summer Scares committee will work with both the recommended list authors and Horror authors from all over the country to provide free programming to libraries. <\/p>\n<p>Once again, Summer Scares will be included as part of iRead, a summer reading program that is used by libraries in the United States and across the globe by the Department of Defense for libraries on military bases. \u201cWhile there is nothing scary about Summer Reading, there is no better time than summer to scare up some great books. iREAD is thrilled (and chilled!) to partner once again with Summer Scares to introduce Horror titles to school and public library workers in order to help them start conversations with readers that perfectly align with our mission to bridge the summer gap while inspiring literacy and life-long learning,\u201d shares iREAD Content and Development Manager Becca Boland. <\/p>\n<p>Booklist is helping to kick off Summer Scares 2024 in March with a series of three, free webinars with this year\u2019s featured authors in conversation with the committee members:<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\tMonday, March 11, 2024, at 4pm Eastern, featuring our Middle Grade authors and moderated by Sarah Hunter<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u25cf\tThursday, March 21, 2024, at 2pm Eastern, featuring our Young Adult authors and moderated by Yaika Sabat<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u25cf\tMonday March 25, 2024, at 2pm Eastern, featuring our Adult authors and moderated by Clay McLeod Chapman<\/p>\n<p>Each webinar lasts one hour.
