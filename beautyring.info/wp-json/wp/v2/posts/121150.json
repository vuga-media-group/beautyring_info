As per the American Society of Clinical Oncology, 2020, oncologists have seen a larger number of new patients across five common cancers compared to pre-pandemic levels, among which cervical cancer registered an increase of 20%. With high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of pre-invasive lesions, cervical cancer can be avoided.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In regions with limited access to pathology services, such as Africa, ensuring healthcare accessibility becomes crucial. Consequently, companies are actively developing innovative technologies to empower patients and involve them more actively in managing their health conditions. An example of such a development is the mobile health software called iThemba Life, which provides users with HPV viral load information, educational resources, reminders, and support directly to their smartphones. This initiative aims to bridge the gap and improve healthcare engagement for individuals in resource-constrained settings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Drivers and Challenges have an Impact on Market Dynamics, which can <\/strong><strong>Impact<\/strong> <strong>your <\/strong><strong>Business.
