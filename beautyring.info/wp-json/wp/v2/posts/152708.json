Increase in urbanization, growth of middle class consumers, and surge in rate of female participation in labor force in many developing and developed markets has encouraged adoption of convenience-oriented lifestyles, making K-Beauty products more desirable. In addition, as consumers become more meticulous regarding their lifestyle choices, they are looking deeper than superficial solutions and choosing more traditional healthy approaches of beauty. Hence, the rise in demand for natural and organically derived ingredients in cosmetic and personal care products, has created new avenues in the K-beauty cosmeceutical market. <\/p>\n<p>Moreover, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, manufacturers have increased social media advertisement of using herbal skin care products to reach a large consumer base. However, implementation of lockdown and curfew practices globally is affecting the domestic as well as international production of skin care products, which in turn, hampers the growth of the overall market. Thus, the outbreak of COVID-19 has negatively impacted the K-Beauty products market in 2020, as sales of companies have reduced and operations have been halted. <\/p>\n<p>Market Key Players: <\/p>\n<p>The major players in the global K-beauty products market analyzed in this report include ABLE C&amp;C CO., Ltd., Adwin Korea Corp, Annie&#8217;s Way International Co., Ltd., The Beauty Factory, Ltd., Bluehug, Inc., BNH Cosmetics, Ceragem Health and Beauty Co, Ltd., CK Beauty Enterprise Inc., LG Household &amp; Health Care and AMOREPACIFIC CORPORATION. <\/p>\n<p>Key Findings Of The Study <\/p>\n<p>Based on product type, the sheet mask segment accounted for the highest K-beauty products market share in 2019, growing at a CAGR of 8.7% and cleanser segment growing fastest with a CAGR of 11.0% between 2021 and 2027. <\/p>\n<p>Based on end user, the female segment accounted for about 69% of the market share in 2019.
