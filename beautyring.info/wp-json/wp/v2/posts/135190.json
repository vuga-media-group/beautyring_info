It helps us regulate our circadian rhythms. So we really love to have at least 12 hours of sunlight a day, if not more.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Dr. Kelly Bennett, Texas Tech Physicians Family Medicine<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>LUBBOCK, TEXAS, U.S., October 26, 2023 \/<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/\" dir=\"auto\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">EINPresswire.com<\/a>\/ &#8212; As the seasons transition from summer\u2019s long days and sweltering heat to the shorter, cooler and more colorful days of autumn, there are fewer hours and opportunities for people to enjoy the sunlight. This can lead to a form of depression known as seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, a low level of depression that&#8217;s common in the northern hemisphere during this time of year when Earth tilts away from the sun and gives us fewer hours of daylight and chillier temperatures.<\/p>\n<p>Kelly Bennett, M.D., a family medicine doctor at Texas Tech Physicians, said this lack of warmth and sunshine has a tendency to make people isolate themselves indoors. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe body likes the sunlight versus dark,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIt helps us to regulate our circadian rhythms, so we really love to have at least 12 hours of sunlight a day, if not more. People are more energetic when it&#8217;s warmer, and when there&#8217;s more sunlight, people spend more time outside their homes interacting with people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are ways in which people can manage their exposure to sunlight, especially in the morning. One of the tools Bennett frequently recommends is a light therapy lamp. These lamps, also known as light boxes, are designed to simulate sunlight and stimulate the pineal gland in the brain, making the body think its bright and sunny even in the dead of night. The pineal gland is responsible for producing melatonin, a hormone that regulates the body\u2019s circadian rhythms that play a significant role in a person\u2019s sleep patterns.<\/p>\n<p>For those who may not have access to a light box, Bennett suggested an alternative that helps her as she prepares for a day at the office: turning on all the lights in the house.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I wake up in the morning, I&#8217;m a complete grump and I would love to just shade my eyes and blindly go around the house without putting a light in my eyes because I find it painful to get up in the morning,\u201d Bennett explained. \u201cBut I have learned that even though it hurts, it&#8217;s a lot better if I flip on every single light \u2014 the lamp, the light overhead, two lights in my bathroom \u2014 and just saturate myself with light to tell my pineal gland, \u2018Okay, even though it&#8217;s seven o&#8217;clock and pitch dark outside, it is daylight to you, so you need to get up and get at it.\u2019 I have found that that helps very much, although when I get to work and the sun hasn&#8217;t come up yet, I\u2019m back to being maybe a wee bit grumpy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And though there is not an abundance of research to back it up, Bennett said some people experiencing seasonal affective disorder take vitamin D supplements because they are thought to generally help with mood disorders. However, she added, before purchasing a light box or a bottle of vitamin D, it\u2019s important for one to know if the blues they\u2019re experiencing are due to a bout of seasonal affective disorder or whether their feelings are an indication of something more serious.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf dark mornings make you feel like, \u2018This is not much fun; I don&#8217;t want to be here, I&#8217;d rather be on vacation on a beach,\u2019 but then you start interacting with people at work and all that just drops away and you feel fine, you&#8217;re probably dealing with a touch of seasonal affective disorder,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHowever, if you get to work and you still feel upset and depressed and grumpy, and even interacting with folks isn\u2019t lightening your mood, then you may need to talk to your doctor or a therapist about your feelings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; 30 &#8211;<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Suzanna Cisneros<br \/>Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center<br \/>+1 806-773-4242<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/664382140\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=IZ4Xd1YnQwElySUh&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      October 26, 2023, 21:48 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/664382140\/shorter-days-less-sunshine-can-lead-to-seasonal-affective-disorder\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
