After achieving third place with her submission of the first book in the series last year, titled Thunder\u2019s Grand Adventure, Julie Elkins Hoseeb is proud to be a Bookfest winner once again with her sequel in the chapter book series, based on her husky Thunder.<\/p>\n<p>The BookFest honors authors who create outstanding works of fiction and nonfiction. The BookFest&#8217;s mission is rooted in the belief that literature has transformative power and, in a desire to support and celebrate those who create it.<\/p>\n<p>Desiree\u0301 Duffy, Founder of The BookFest, says, \u201cToday, more than ever, it is important to recognize authors and creatives for their vital role in crafting the stories that shape our world and define our humanity. Books bring us to new worlds, take us on adventures, give us the means to evaluate our lives and instill a sense of empathy within us. I believe that by acknowledging authors and their literary achievements, we lift literature in our world, and lift each other in the process.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Julie Elkins Hoseeb says, \u201cI\u2019m so excited to be a Bookfest Award recipient in Fall 2023. It\u2019s been a lifetime dream to write a children\u2019s book series. After losing my small business in 2022 and relocating to Connecticut, my family and I have found a home in the beautiful forests surrounding us, and our pets are happier than ever. I\u2019m happy to announce that I\u2019m currently writing Book 3 of this series, titled Thunder\u2019s Valentine.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For more information about The BookFest Awards and to see the list of winners, please visit the Awards Page on The BookFest website.<\/p>\n<p>To watch the Salute to The BookFest Award Winners video montage, or to see recordings of The BookFest videos, please visit the Programming Page of The BookFest Website.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br \/>Julie Elkins Hoseeb is an award-winning author, budding graphic artist, and entrepreneur.
