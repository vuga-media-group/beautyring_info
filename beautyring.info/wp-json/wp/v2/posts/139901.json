This increase of $13,700,000 was primarily from increases in (i) Journal Technologies\u2019 consulting fees of $7,911,000, license and maintenance fees of $4,311,000 and other public service fees of $1,147,000, and (ii) the Traditional Business\u2019 advertising revenues of $364,000, partially offset by a decrease in the Traditional Business\u2019 advertising service fees and other of $42,000.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The Traditional Business\u2019 pretax income increased by $1,682,000 to $2,384,000 from $702,000 in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a reduced long-term supplemental compensation accrual of $1,600,000 to a reduction of $470,000 from an addition of $1,130,000 in the prior fiscal year, partially offset by increased personnel costs of $798,000 to $10,416,000 from $9,618,000. Journal Technologies\u2019 business segment pretax income increased by $2,981,000 to $4,268,000 from $1,287,000 in the prior fiscal year primarily resulting from increased revenues of $13,369,000. These revenue increases were partially offset by increased operating expenses of $10,388,000 mostly due to (i) increased personnel costs because of salary adjustments due to recent inflation in the compensation market for talent, (ii) additional contractor services and the hiring of additional staff members to strengthen operational efficiencies, accelerate product development, and bolster the teams working on the company\u2019s installation projects, (iii) increased third-party hosting fees which were billed to clients and (iv) increased business travel expenses.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">During fiscal 2023, the Company sold certain of its marketable securities for approximately $2,826,000, realizing net gains on the sales of those marketable securities of $422,000 (as compared to the sales of $80,570,000 in marketable securities with realized net gains of $14,249,000 in the prior year), and purchased additional marketable securities with a total cost of approximately $10,001,000 (as compared to an additional marketable security purchase of $117,678,000 in the prior fiscal year with additional borrowings of $43,000,000). There were interest expense increases of $3,229,000 to $4,255,000 from $1,026,000 primarily because of federal interest rate increases. In addition, there were net unrealized gains on marketable securities of $17,024,000 as compared to net unrealized losses of $123,401,000 in the prior fiscal year. The Company\u2019s investments generated approximately $8,336,000 in dividends and interest income for fiscal 2023, as compared to $5,451,000 in the prior fiscal year.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Consolidated pretax income was $28,102,000, as compared to a pretax loss of $102,549,000 in the prior fiscal year. The net income per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the comparable financial periods. The shares used in the calculation were 1,377,026 and 1,379,655 for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. There was consolidated net income of $21,452,000 ($15.58 per share) for fiscal 2023, as compared to a consolidated net loss of $75,624,000 (-$54.81 per share) in the prior fiscal year.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">At September 30, 2023, the Company held marketable securities valued at $303,128,000, including net pretax unrealized gains of $137,716,000, and accrued a deferred tax liability of $36,260,000, for estimated income taxes due only upon the sales of the net appreciated securities. The balance of the margin loan secured by the securities portfolio was $75,000,000 at both September 30, 2023 and 2022.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">During fiscal 2023, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $6,650,000 on pretax income of $28,102,000.\u00a0\u00a0 The income tax provision consisted of tax provisions of $110,000 on the realized gains on marketable securities, $4,140,000 on the unrealized gain on marketable securities, and $2,803,000 on operating income, partially offset by a tax benefit of $403,000 for the dividends received deduction and other permanent differences.\u00a0 Consequently, the overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 23.7%, after including the taxes on the realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities.<\/p>\n<p align=\"center\">**********<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Daily Journal Corporation publishes newspapers and web sites covering California and Arizona, and produces several specialized information services.
