The rapid spread of the virus hampered market expansion in the first half of 2020, causing disruptions in the export of humanoid robot components and production. However, there was a rise in demand for humanoid robots in the medical industry in the second half of 2020. In hospitals, these robots were used to safeguard the safety of medical employees and assist infected patients. Furthermore, humanoid robots found applications in a variety of industries, including healthcare, where they were used for tasks such as sanitizer distribution, thermal scanning, and disinfection. This increased the market growth during the pandemic.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=JP4Hp7idqJ4feEwGNH0qcu-zIgUujqGTv-vqkdL9yDzWkI6kQWTSe1aeWXlfDjHOYnpG3ErwBVVY4NzkBPYRzg8eS-ExpHbx1g0KbXgvDUT_LONmX3qK6ukUJEMF7VHuU-fs7C-qYAbLldbBJm_xNsJp5-VoJPNZkHSqiXjaqKOgIJL9_IT7MSmTow2bxPdZ\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>Download a Comprehensive PDF Sample of Humanoid Robot Market<\/b><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Factors Impacting the Humanoid Robot Market Growth<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The development of advanced robots to improve consumer contact and experience, as well as the increasing demand for robots in retail applications, are factors influencing the growth of the humanoid robot market. The market is also predicted to grow as the need for humanoid robots to give personal help in daily living is rising. Moreover, ongoing technical advances targeted at building more efficient and cost-effective robot models are expected to unlock exciting opportunities for the global humanoid robot market. However, the high price of robotics and a lack of investment in technological advancement are key impediments to market expansion.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The report segments the global humanoid robot market into product, source, application, and region.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Hardware Sub-Segment to Grab a Foremost Share of the Market<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The hardware sub-segment of the component segment is foreseen to observe leading growth in the forecast period. This growth is mainly because hardware components play a vital role in the development of humanoid robots since they are the actual components that form the structure of the robot&#8217;s body and allow it to perform tasks.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Personal Assistance and Caregiving Sub-Segment to Observer Leading Growth\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The personal assistance and caregiving sub-segment of the application segment is projected to grow enormously in the forecast period. This growth is mainly because of the rising geriatric population and increasing demand for personal care at home to offer basic assistance and companionship to the aged or disabled people.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Wheel Drive Sub-Segment to Witness Dominant Growth\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The wheel drive sub-segment of the motion type segment is expected to experience significant growth in the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to the cost-effectiveness of wheel drive robots compared to legged robots. Wheel drive robots require fewer components, making them easier to build and maintain. They are also more straightforward to repair and replace, contributing to their popularity and increased adoption in various industries.<b>\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=Y252s2RFt8BNPjPp4PKqvaWPKo4rtEcsLQ6oPIB1fPQR3Yc-cMppdiDYm6Pg7CDYxf0MUde8Lvp5VLyOUz92IQjAtjUdE6Y7quCHTjcE84jbDBWnsSHDcrKs1UMLTpwMDT3LCpd9N4_BcLrRE933GseA8Zs3DtobGAypzSr7g7dbHk40vBlsRaJm8a6J-QURf5VkNZpNWQLA2zwr3puFsb5M3CBZ5KywArMAfBsD6Zo=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>Schedule a call to the Expert Analyst to get the Latest update on the Humanoid Robot Market<\/b><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Asia-Pacific Humanoid Robot Market to Perceive Maximum Growth<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The report analyzes the global humanoid robot market across several regions such as North America, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and LAMEA. Among these, the Asia-Pacific market is projected to observe significant growth in the estimated period.
