Set against the backdrop of her Georgia hometown, deeply scarred by the 1946 Moores Ford Lynching, also known as the &#8220;last mass lynching in America,&#8221; Calabrese masterfully uncovers buried truths and ignites crucial conversations. Through insightful interviews and meticulous research, she paints a nuanced picture of historical factors shaping racial divides, shedding light on how these divisions persist through generations. Delving into the town&#8217;s collective memory, &#8220;UNSPOKEN&#8221; confronts contemporary challenges such as historical denial and segregation, urging viewers to break the silence and work towards genuine reconciliation. This thought-provoking examination is a timely call to action, bridging divides and inspiring meaningful change.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are pleased to host this screening and discussion,&#8221; Tony Clark, Public Affairs Director at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library, said. &#8220;The film, along with exhibit &#8216;The Negro Motorist Green Book&#8217; are reminders of the need to discuss race relations and promote equality and understanding.\u201d   <\/p>\n<p>\u201cUNSPOKEN\u201d has received critical acclaim and recognition, winning the Audience Choice Award for Documentary at the Macon Film Festival; Documentary Features Special Jury Award at the the Rome International Film Festival; and Best Documentary Award at the Reedy Reels Film Festival.
