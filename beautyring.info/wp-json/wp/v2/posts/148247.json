According to a study by Anna Ponjoan et al. that was released in the Clinical Epidemiology Journal in March 2019, the prevalence of dementia was 5.1% in Spain. In addition, dementia is more likely to affect women than men, and the risk increases with age.

For instance, according to the National Clinical Trials (NCT) Registry, there were more than 800 ongoing interventional clinical studies for treating dementia in various stages of development globally as of March 29, 2021. To develop effective medicines, industry firms focus on cutting-edge techniques like amyloid protein.<\/p>\n<p><b>Regional Analysis\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Europe is the most significant shareholder in the global dementia drugs market and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.05% during the forecast period.
