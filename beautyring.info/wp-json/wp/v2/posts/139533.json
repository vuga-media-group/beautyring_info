From this pool of talent, eight artists representing a diversity of disciplines were selected for seven residencies in Green Mountain Falls throughout 2024. Nestled within the foothills of America\u2019s Mountain, Pikes Peak, the rural hamlet of Green Mountain Falls provides an idyllic setting for these month-long residencies, offering 30 days of uninterrupted creative solace. In addition to a generous stipend and housing, artists are offered individualized support to fulfill their residency goals while living and engaging within the Green Mountain Falls community.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFollowing an extensive review of over 250 applications we received from artists representing almost all 50 states and 26 International Countries, we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled with the diversity of artists, disciplines and projects that comprise our exciting cohort of Green Box Artists in Residence in 2024\u201d said Green Box Executive Director, Scott Levy. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to witness the creative practices of these outstanding artists as they become embedded in Green Mountain Falls and connect to the community throughout the year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Among the eight talented artists chosen for the 2024 residency program, all identify as either female or non-binary. The artists represent a wide range of exciting and diverse projects including: a hand-crafted animated film utilizing painted clay on glass, an ephemeral light sculpture to be installed indoors on the Green Box Campus, sonic experiences in Green Box\u2019s Green Mountain Falls Skyspace by James Turrell, and an operatic experience inspired by celestial objects. Additional disciplines represented include photography, fiction writing, and podcasting.<\/p>\n<p>Neena Pathak: Neena is an accomplished Producer and Editor formerly at NPR and the NY Times, and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 2021.

Rooted in Sweden, GAEYA blends Scandinavian mystery &#8211; driven by powerful vocals &#8211; with sounds of natural ancient worlds and ambient synth-soundscapes by converting them into atmospheric landscapes. <\/p>\n<p>Kristina Barker:  Currently living in Portland, Oregon, freelance photojournalist and independent fine artist Kristina Barker has documented news and communities for The New York Times, Cosmopolitan, The Washington Post, and many others. Kristina\u2019s work focuses on our natural world, the climate crisis, grief, surviving trauma and exploring the bewildering experience of existing as a human. <\/p>\n<p>Thu Kim Vu: Based in Vietnam, Thu Kim Vu will be in residence throughout the month of June, creating a paper light sculpture installation inside the Lakeview Terrace building on the Green Box Campus which will be on display during the 16th Annual Green Box Arts Festival.
