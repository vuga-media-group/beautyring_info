His path initially led him to Saint Mel\u2019s College in Longford, boarding alongside his close friend Thomas Gerety, both with aspirations of entering the priesthood and dedicating their lives to aiding Third World countries through foreign missions. Tragically, during their third year at the college, Michael experienced a profound loss when his dear friend Thomas transitioned to the spirit world. This event altered the trajectory of Michael&#8217;s life, steering him away from the priesthood and towards embracing fatherhood, devoting himself to raise his two sons.<\/p>\n<p>Relocating to London in 1973, Michael&#8217;s journey took an unexpected turn as he discovered the Spiritual Association of Great Britain. Immersing himself in a medium development circle, his perspective on life underwent a remarkable transformation through his profound encounters with Spirit. Presently residing in Herefordshire, just outside London, Michael finds solace and joy in spending cherished moments with his two sons. He has transitioned into a full-time role as a holistic healer and medium, extending his services to people and Spiritualist Churches across the UK. He regards the gift he has received as precious, attributing it to the divine and thanking God for its presence in his life. For Michael, this spiritual love transcends boundaries of religion and culture, accessible to all who seek it.<\/p>\n<p>With a wealth of experience and expertise, Michael is a qualified international therapist specializing in Aromatherapy, Reflexology, Reiki, Sport Therapy, and Indian Head Massage. His holistic approach to healing encourages individuals to consider their lifestyles comprehensively, aiming to restore harmony within the trinity of Mind-Body-Spirit.<\/p>\n<p>Message from the Author:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe desire of this book is to help your soul to be able to know and work with the love that exists in the spirit world. The soul journey is important in life. Memories with thanks is a way to help you find your true self and feel the power of spirit love and life force within you. Helping you to create happy memories and inner peace.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Lennon life&#8217;s work is a testament to his dedication to healing, guiding, and fostering spiritual connections, aiming to bring peace and balance to the lives of those he encounters. He was engaged in a range of promotional endeavors, spanning BBC TV features, BBC Radio features, Soul Therapy workshops held across the UK, public demonstrations of mediumship, and participation in Mind-Body-Spirit Festivals.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Lennon recently participated in a Prime Seven Media Spotlight interview with Logan Crawford and answered questions about his book, \u201cMemories with Thanks\u201d; (Logan Crawford TV Interview Link: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cDJfhX1iDtQ\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cDJfhX1iDtQ<\/a> )<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t miss your chance to experience the pages of this book, you may visit amazon.com or you may click this link <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Memories-Thanks-Spirit-Love-One\/dp\/1434317366\/ref\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Memories-Thanks-Spirit-Love-One\/dp\/1434317366\/ref<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>For further information about his book and the author, you may visit his website at memorieswiththanks.com<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Luna Harrington<br \/>Prime Seven Media<br \/>+1 414-882-5318<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/681927411\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Prime-Seven-Media-106775398771340\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/primesevenmedia\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Spiritual Poetry Explored  Michael Lennon&#8217;s &#8216;Memories With Thanks&#8217;  Earthly &amp; Divine Bonds <\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"cDJfhX1iDtQ\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Spiritual Poetry Explored \ud83c\udf0c Michael Lennon&#039;s &#039;Memories With Thanks&#039; \ud83d\udcd6 Earthly &amp; Divine Bonds \ud83d\udcab\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/cDJfhX1iDtQ?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=wcMqyTuBUK8XNgmN&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      January 17, 2024, 16:20 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/681927411\/a-heartwarming-odyssey-memories-with-thanks-spirit-love-volume-one-by-michael-lennon\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
