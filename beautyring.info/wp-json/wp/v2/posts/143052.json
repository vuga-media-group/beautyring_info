The first episode of the series presents four short documentaries filmed in Italy that highlight the stories of Italian artists, scholars and entrepreneurs in the fields of educational technology, edutainment and entertainment education.  <\/p>\n<p>Education is Boring is an initiative developed by a diverse group of Texas State University&#8217;s faculty members, students and alumni from multiple academic disciplines.   The project aims to use storytelling to encourage the widespread adoption of technological advances in mobile communications, AI and entertainment as an effort to re-envision the way that classes are taught at colleges and universities.  <\/p>\n<p>The four short documentaries featured in the first episode of Education is Boring were directed by Sergio Carvajal-Leoni, a faculty member of the College of Fine Arts and Communications at Texas State University.

The event includes the special presentation of renowned Italian innovators from the fields of educational technology and entertainment education, who will join the event virtually. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For us it is a joy and honor to premier this first episode at our department&#8221; shared Dr. Moira Di Mauro-Jackson, a professor of Italian at Texas State University. &#8220;We hope this project inspires students and colleagues to see the many possibilities we now have to improve the way we learn.
