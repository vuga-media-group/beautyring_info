It said: \u201cMore than 8,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with anal cancer each year. Due to higher rates of the human papilloma virus, a key risk factor, it affects women more than men. If found early, the disease can be successfully treated. Several types of tumors may be found in the anus. While some of them are malignant (cancer), others are benign (not cancer) or precancerous (may develop into cancer). The main types of anal cancer are: Carcinoma in situ\u00a0is early cancer or precancerous cells. They are only on the surface cells of the anal canal. This also may be called Bowen\u2019s disease; Squamous cell cancer\u00a0(carcinoma) forms in the cells that line the anus. This is the most common type of anal cancer; Adenocarcinomas\u00a0develop in the glands around the anus; and Skin cancers,\u00a0including basal cell and melanoma, often are found when they are in advanced stages.\u201d A <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=yj1aPQQ1XqPeKqqaf8LQclQK5KB-e0r-dhHw9vn5TR2FbcsEg9tV1R6P1OmS_6tqPaNWU9GYm2kOMDbPDJHXLuNIYfLQwLj-YlsSw_IHtMsxHKApQOSCKxYxw5XGIOrzUCiXQm7cOV87398gj7Izsw==\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">report<\/a> from Market Research Future projected that: \u201cThe Anal cancer market is anticipated to reach USD 1,638.5 Million by 2030 at 8.6% CAGR\u2026 through 2030. It said: \u201cAnal cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the anus, which is the orifice at the rectum&#8217;s end. Anal cancer has one of the highest rates of occurrence and prevalence in the globe. Lifestyle issues, aging, and diet are thought to be the primary causes of anal cancer. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an increase of roughly 70% in anal cancer cases is projected globally over the Anal Cancer Market Analysis period (2030). Squamous cell carcinoma, which develops from cells around or in the anal entrance or, in rare cases, in the anal canal, is the most common type of anal cancer. This malignancy is frequently linked to the human papillomavirus (HPV), with HPV malignancies or cervical cancers having a significant chance of progressing to anal cancer. Anal cancer has no specific symptoms; however, it might cause bleeding from the anal area, a tumor or swelling near the anus, or a change in bowel habits.\u201d Active biotech and pharma companies in the markets this week include <strong>Oncolytics Biotech<\/strong><sup><strong>\u00ae<\/strong><\/sup><strong> Inc.<\/strong> (NASDAQ: ONCY) (TSX: ONC), <strong>Exelixis, Inc. <\/strong>(NASDAQ: EXEL), <strong>Pfizer Inc. <\/strong>(NYSE: PFE), <strong>BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. <\/strong>(NASDAQ: BTAI), <strong>Bristol Myers Squibb <\/strong>(NYSE: BMY).<\/p>\n<p>The report continued: \u201cThe income earned by medications used to treat anal cancer, as well as other screening tests, kits, and medical devices used to diagnose colorectal cancer, is tracked in the study. The high spending on public health initiatives, as well as the rapid rise in global healthcare expenditure and research and development expenditure in the field of oncology, are projected to provide substantial potential prospects and increase the market size. The Americas are likely to lead the anal cancer market because of the increased prevalence of anal cancer. Europe is predicted to represent the second-largest share of the anal cancer market because of the increased prevalence of anal cancer and the presence of significant market participants. In The Middle East and Africa, due to the high incidence rate of anal cancer, the market is likely to develop gradually throughout the forecast period.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Oncolytics Biotech<\/strong><sup><strong>\u00ae<\/strong><\/sup><strong> Inc.<\/strong> <strong>(NASDAQ: ONCY) (TSX: ONC) Initiates Enrollment Expansion of GOBLET Anal Cancer Cohort &#8211; <\/strong><strong><em>Successful Stage 1 data showed a near tripling of Objective Response Rate compared to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy, including a Complete Response, and supports expansion<\/em><\/strong><strong> &#8211; <\/strong>Oncolytics Biotech<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> Inc., a clinical-stage immunotherapeutics company focused on oncology, today announced the expansion of enrollment for the anal cancer cohort of the GOBLET study evaluating pelareorep in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>) in patients with second-line or later unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA).

The results reported at IMACC 2023 showed that the combination of pelareorep and atezolizumab provided a 37.5% objective response rate, including one patient with a long-lasting complete response, and good overall tolerability. These data represent a meaningful contrast to recent clinical trial results which show that patients with second-line or later anal carcinoma treated with checkpoint inhibitor therapy experienced response rates of 10-14%,\u201d said Dr. Matt Coffey, President and Chief Executive Officer of Oncolytics.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe begin the Stage 2 expansion with substantial optimism for patients and the potential of pelareorep, especially considering the initial efficacy signal observed for pelareorep-based therapy in pancreatic cancer. There is currently no established standard therapy for patients with anal carcinoma who have failed first-line treatment. Continued positive results could potentially expand the opportunity for pelareorep beyond the lead indications of breast cancer and pancreatic cancer and open the door to a rapid regulatory pathway in this rare and significantly under-served patient population,\u201d continued Dr. Coffey.<\/p>\n<p>Dirk Arnold, M.D., Ph.D., Director of Asklepios Tumorzentrum Hamburg, and primary investigator of the GOBLET trial, commented, \u201cOne of the most difficult challenges in my practice is the limited number of treatment options that are available for patients with advanced anal cancer who have progressed on first-line therapy. I am enthusiastic about the expansion of this cohort because it will enable the continued evaluation of the pelareorep\/atezolizumab combination and could provide important confirmatory data that may lead to better treatment options for patients with this late-stage disease.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe look forward to building on the oncology community\u2019s enthusiastic reception of the IMACC 2023 data by expanding enrollment in the anal carcinoma cohort and incorporating additional sites into the study,\u201d commented Thomas Heineman, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer at Oncolytics. \u201cCareful consideration of recently published clinical trial results indicates that a modest expansion of fewer than 20 patients will be sufficient to solidify the efficacy signal we have observed to date and lay the groundwork for a potential future registrational study in this population. We look forward to continuing our excellent collaboration with the clinical sites and investigators at AIO and hope to report additional results in 2025.\u201d\u00a0<strong><em>CONTINUED<\/em><\/strong><strong>\u2026<\/strong> <strong>Read these full press releases and more news for ONCY at:<\/strong>\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=wjXDXT0mpJCdCxXcftCtBOW38v3ZWFj7zNc1w-gtZFPVepJLrl-FTZk-6Uo9zC1FvvUqSb_0-qS-jm4nPgZQkuw570ZbBxFUWBkGci_3Djw-TQxPd99Ld2UNA0JZbdYuczOUZ7x6baBXNTWjV0AN8FV069DJUXGySjhHm9bEfY0=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.financialnewsmedia.com\/news-oncy\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>Other recent developments in the biotech industry of note for cancer events include:<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Exelixis, Inc.
