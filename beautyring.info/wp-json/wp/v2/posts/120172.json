He believes that it is critical for the industry to create more content that resonates with and celebrates African American culture. This call comes as part of his overall mission to create more opportunities for African Americans in the entertainment industry.<\/p>\n<p>Collins, whose network specializes in urban-focused programming, has spent over 30 years pushing for increased diversity in the entertainment industry. He believes that by creating more opportunities for African Americans, the industry can better reflect their unique experiences. &#8220;Black stories are not only entertaining, but they are educational and inspirational as well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We must invest in television programs and feature films that show the beauty of our culture.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In addition to increasing Black representation on the network, Collins also wants to focus on quality programming that will engage viewers both nationally and internationally. \u201cWe want our viewers to be able to connect with our programs on an emotional level. We want them to feel like they\u2019re part of something bigger than themselves\u2014something that celebrates their culture and heritage while still being accessible to everyone,\u201d he stated. \u201cUrban TV Network is committed to creating more opportunities for Black creatives and showing the world that our stories can be just as powerful, inspiring and entertaining as any other.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Collins also wants to see more opportunities for African American actors and directors in Hollywood. He believes that having more people of color behind the scenes will not only help create more authentic stories but also empower those who have historically been marginalized in the industry. &#8220;We need to ensure that everyone is given an equal opportunity to succeed,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Collins hopes his efforts will inspire change within the entertainment industry and help foster an environment where everyone feels represented by what they see on television or in movies. &#8220;It&#8217;s time we take steps towards making sure Black voices are heard within all forms of media,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As an African American, I am passionate about bringing diverse voices and stories to life. <\/p>\n<p>Collins&#8217; call is being met with enthusiasm from many in the industry. Not only does it create more opportunities for more African American talent, but it also allows them to showcase their unique culture and experiences on a larger platform.<\/p>\n<p>Urban TV Network is already taking steps to make this vision a reality. The network recently announced its $2.5 billion Private Placement for acquisitions. The company plans to set aside half a billion dollars for the development of new original film and television programs.<\/p>\n<p>Joseph Collins, Jr\u2019s commitment to creating more opportunities for African Americans in television is commendable. By increasing Black programming on Urban TV Network, he is helping create a platform where everyone can see themselves represented on screen while also providing access to unique stories that are often neglected by mainstream media outlets.<\/p>\n<p>Be a part of this exciting new chapter in the life of the company.
