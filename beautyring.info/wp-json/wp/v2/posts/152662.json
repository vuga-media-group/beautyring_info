USA Fibroid Centers is sponsoring the event, organized by the Fibroid Fighters Foundation, to help women learn firsthand from fibroid patients about the symptoms of fibroids and how they found successful treatment.  Yan Katsnelson, M.D., Founder and CEO of USA Fibroid Centers, will deliver the keynote address. <\/p>\n<p>Kym Lee, a well-known celebrity makeup artist, will host the DMV event with fellow fibroid ambassador, bestselling author and Life and Women&#8217;s Coach Ella Destiny. Both women have become strong advocates for fibroid awareness to assist women in recognizing the symptoms and understanding treatment options for fibroid disease, which affects 26 million American women.  <\/p>\n<p>The program will start with brunch featuring classic Southern cooking while enjoying a captivating opening musical performance by R&amp;B singer Kenny Sway. A panel discussion will feature fibroid survivors sharing their stories of resilience and triumph. In addition to valuable insights from patient and physician perspectives, attendees can network with other women in a supportive and empowering environment, giving them a unique opportunity to talk about fibroids. <\/p>\n<p>Awareness events are crucial in educating the public about diseases and their treatment options.  <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;By uniting the community at supportive awareness events, it can dispel myths, answer questions, and empower individuals to recognize symptoms and seek early diagnosis,&#8221; said Dr. Katsnelson. &#8220;This increased knowledge can lead to better health outcomes, as people are more likely to take preventative measures, get screened regularly, and advocate for themselves when seeking treatment.&#8221;   <\/p>\n<p>A national leader in women&#8217;s health, Dr. Katsnelson advocates for <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.usafibroidcenters.com\/uterine-fibroid-treatment\/uterine-fibroid-embolization\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">uterine fibroid embolization (UFE)<\/a> as a less invasive alternative to hysterectomy. UFE preserves fertility and offers faster recovery times compared to surgery. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Women should have a voice in their own health care decisions, especially when it can impact not only their quality of life but their overall physical and mental health,&#8221; said Katsnelson. &#8220;Too many women are still undergoing hysterectomies for a common condition that can be cured with less invasive, safer and more affordable UFE treatment.  <\/p>\n<p>Kym Lee agrees, &#8220;I feel as if something was taken from me as a woman after my hysterectomy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Kym Lee&#8217;s experience inspired her Instagram Live program, Talk About &#8220;U,&#8221; in which she interviews celebrities, political figures, physicians, and fibroid survivors about fibroid disease and treatment options. <\/p>\n<p>Coach Ella Destiny&#8217;s struggles with fibroids as a teen led to 11 abdominal surgeries and a hysterectomy, which served as motivation for her to write a best-selling book about her health struggles, &#8220;There&#8217;s Nothing Wrong with Saying So What.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to break the generational taboo that we can\u2019t talk about this,\u201d said Destiny. \u201cWe need to educate our young women and make them aware that there are options; you don\u2019t have to have a hysterectomy, and you can have children.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>An Early Bird promo code, &#8220;Fighter15,&#8221; available <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/SistersBrunch-FibroidAwareness.eventbrite.com\/?aff=PR\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">here<\/a>, is valid until June 16 for $15 off the $50 per person tickets.
