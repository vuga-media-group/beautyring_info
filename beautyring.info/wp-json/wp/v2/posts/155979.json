Evoking Marriott Hotels&#8217; rich and trusted legacy, the hotel invites guests to explore <span class=\"xn-location\">Long Beach&#8217;s<\/span> vibrant and thriving convention and entertainment hub, which encompasses abundant walkable dining and shopping options and miles of sandy shoreline as well as several world class attractions, among them the Aquarium of the Pacific, Shoreline Aquatic Park and the Queen Mary.<\/p>\n<p>Featuring modern elegance and warmth, the inviting 12-story hotel showcases 376 contemporary guest rooms and suites, a stunning rooftop pool and deck with sweeping city and ocean views, a central Greatroom lobby designed for social interaction and work, a stylish lobby market, a state-of-the-art exercise facility, ample cutting-edge meeting space and an all-day restaurant \u2013 all radiating a sophisticated motif with an airy modern vibe.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With locally inspired design and sophisticated yet functional spaces, this newest hotel reflects Marriott Hotels&#8217; commitment to elevating our guests&#8217; experience by anticipating their every need,&#8221; said Marriott Long Beach Downtown&#8217;s General Manager, <span class=\"xn-person\">Rahul Vir<\/span>. &#8220;Over the decades, Marriott Hotels has earned the trust of travelers worldwide. We are thrilled to introduce this new, forward-thinking hotel as we continually strive to exceed our guests&#8217; expectations with exceptional and authentic services and elevated experiences.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>Thoughtful, Modern Design<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Much of <span class=\"xn-location\">Southern California&#8217;s<\/span> iconic <span class=\"xn-location\">Long Beach<\/span> was constructed in the aftermath of the devasting 1933 earthquake \u2013 an era when &#8220;streamline modern&#8221; architecture was in its heyday. Derived from the area&#8217;s roaring energy and beach-oriented local culture, the hotel&#8217;s reimagined dramatic and grand design was spearheaded by Looney &amp; Associates LLC \u2013 blending the soft soothing nautical and natural influences of the <span class=\"xn-location\">Long Beach<\/span> locale with a decidedly contemporary aesthetic, including geometric accents, decorative millwork, curved lines, layered textures and patterns and streamlined forms. An intricate backlit metal art piece at the entry drive greets guests while geometric planters and benches throughout the porte coch\u00e8re provide visual interest. With a high glow, the curb check-in desk recalls the forms of marina ship hulls, while an oversized decorative screen allows for abundant natural light.<\/p>\n<p>Anchored by the Greatroom lobby \u2013 a stylish social hub with a nod to the glamourous Art Deco era \u2013 the inviting social space encourages guests to combine work with pleasure.\u00a0Its common areas feature warm wood and gold details, punctuated by curvilinear furnishings, bold colors, geometric patterns, subtle textures and other distinctive elements, all against a backdrop of layered symmetry. Clusters of lounge furniture and a central bar provide guests with ample space to relax and unwind with friends and family or collaborate with colleagues over a playful night cap.<\/p>\n<p>With expansive windows to allow for generous natural light, guest rooms echo the modern, locally inspired theme and nautical elements \u2013 offering guests a restorative yet polished ambiance. Outfitted with platform beds, rich fabrics, crisp white window coverings and metallic accents, accommodations are spacious and inviting with a bright and airy palette incorporating colors of the sea and sky \u2013 including blues, soft whites, browns and greys \u2013 for a breezy oceanfront look. This contemporary feel extends to every bathroom, where a unique curved vanity further infuses a modern beachfront motif. Each guest room features functional technology-enabled work surfaces, resulting in a space that is both flexible and sophisticated. A testament to Marriott Hotels&#8217; unwavering attention to detail, guest rooms are all outfitted with plush robes and slippers, a Nespresso coffeemaker, a flat-screen high-definition TV and upgraded bath products.<\/p>\n<p><b>Locally Curated Dining<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Hotel guests can dine onsite at <b>Local Current<\/b>, where Executive Chef <span class=\"xn-person\">Leo De Leon<\/span> prepares fresh, locally curated seasonal fare with a <span class=\"xn-location\">California<\/span> twist. Committed to supporting the community and practicing sustainability, De Leon has devised inventive menus featuring fresh, natural ingredients sourced from local farms and fishermen.<\/p>\n<p>Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, select highlights include a hearty breakfast buffet, all day brunch, a raw bar with fresh seafood and oysters, vegetarian options and entrees such as pan seared salmon and pressed wagyu burger. A full bar features craft beer, <span class=\"xn-location\">California<\/span> wines, seasonal margaritas, mocktails and much more as well as an array of after dinner drinks, including espresso martinis and Italian digestifs.<\/p>\n<p><b>The Market<\/b> is a 24-hour hub for grab-and-go fare located in the lobby across from the reception area \u2013 offerings include coffee by Starbucks, pastries and sandwiches.<\/p>\n<p>Marriott Long Beach Downtown features <b>M Club, <\/b>a brand signature offered at select Marriott Hotels globally \u2013 which provides Marriott Bonvoy Platinum Elite, Titanium Elite and Ambassador Elite members as well as paying guests an exclusive space to rest, recharge and refocus, every day at any time.
