The growing trend of socializing at cafes among urban youth is expected to drive the cafes and bars market during the forecast period. Urban land use is likely to continue growing at a rate up to 50% faster than global population growth by 2030, which is projected to add 1.2 million km<sup>2<\/sup> of urban built-up area. In addition, an increase in the influx of people into metropolitan areas and a significant rise in the demographic of white-collar workers have\u00a0increased the number of food service establishments.

for menu innovation and customization is the new trend in the cafes and bars market. Consumers are now looking for food pairings with innovative and robust flavor combinations. Millennials are the primary consumers of novel and exotic foods. Additionally, there is a growing demand for adaptive foods for medical reasons, food allergies, and weight loss plans. Consumers like to tailor their food choices to their tastes. By choosing the right flavor palette, market participants can increase consumer repeat visits. Such factors are expected to boost the growth of the global cafes and bars market during the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p><b>Challenge<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Some people prefer home-cooked meals to restaurant meals. The main reason is that restaurant food is expensive and full of artificial additives and other harmful ingredients, making it unhealthy. Easy to use, hygienic, and non-contaminated ingredients make home-cooked meals more cost-effective and nutritious than cafe\u00a0or bar meals. Thus, home-cooked food is likely to hinder market growth, as consumers, particularly millennials and baby boomers, are becoming more health-conscious.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Cafes and bars market\u00a02023-2027: Market Segmentation<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The market is segmented by product (beverages and food), type (bars and pubs, cafes, and specialty coffee shops), and geography (<span class=\"xn-location\">Europe<\/span>, APAC, <span class=\"xn-location\">North America<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Middle East<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Africa<\/span>, and <span class=\"xn-location\">South America<\/span>).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The market growth in the beverage segment will be significant during the forecast period. The beverage segment includes the sales of hot and cold beverages such as coffee, tea, and alcoholic beverages such as tequila, whiskey, and cognac. The major driving factor is the increasing demand for specialty and premium hot beverages such as coffee. Moreover, consumers are becoming interested in carbonated soft drinks flavored with tropical flavors such as passion fruit, pineapple, and mango. Such factors are expected to drive the growth of the beverage segment of the global cafes and bars market during the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntac\"><b>This report presents a detailed picture of the market by the way of study, synthesis, and summation of data from multiple sources through an analysis of key parameters- <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.technavio.com\/talk-to-us?report=IRTNTR45383&amp;type=sample&amp;rfs=epd&amp;src=report&amp;utm_source=prenewswire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=t41_v2_rfs5_wk16_2023_014&amp;utm_content=IRTNTR45383\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">View a Sample Report<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Companies Mentioned<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The global cafes and bars market is a highly fragmented market because of the presence of numerous small and large vendors.
