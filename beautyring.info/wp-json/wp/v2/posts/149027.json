Ultimately, he overcame poverty and homelessness and became a hero to children and adults who struggled to read and write. <\/p>\n<p>Always Ask for Help shares his inspiring story and highlights the real-life consequences of low literacy. It follows Stewart from an impoverished childhood with 11 siblings in the small mining town of Cobalt, Ontario to his extraordinary role as a literacy advocate and public speaker. Lee is also producing a documentary about Stewart and the low literacy epidemic.<\/p>\n<p>At 45, Stewart found a literacy center and took steps toward literacy. Later, he met Janet Lee, an educator who saw his presentation captivate and transform her hard-to-reach high school students. Lee and Stewart spent the next eight years traveling to more than 70 schools. They handed out Arnie cards that read: \u201cAlways Ask for Help.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tragically, Stewart died from cancer in 2012. His last words to Janet were: \u201cTell the kids to never be afraid and to always ask for help.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Lee continues his legacy by shining a light on low literacy and telling his story. A renowned speaker for Innovative Educators, her global presentations inspire teachers to reimagine their approach to students in need of assistance. <\/p>\n<p>She kicks off a book tour Fall 2024 and plans to visit bookstores and schools across the United States and Canada.
