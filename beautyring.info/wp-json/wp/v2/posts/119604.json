The rise in the costs of manufacturing results in an increase in product pricing, further constraining the expansion of the market. Huge expenditures are also necessary for creating flexible production lines that help in adaption to changes in consumer demand for different ice makers. As a result, one of the main factors hindering the growth of the ice maker market during the forecast period is the high initial investment and working capital that is needed to construct a clear ice maker manufacturing plant.<\/p>\n<p>North America is said to dominate the ice maker market with maximum revenue share. The importance of penetration of ice in the food business, coffee shops, bars, and lounges acts as a major factor in the enlargement of the ice maker market.
