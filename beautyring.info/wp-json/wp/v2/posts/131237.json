The top songs, classic hits, or catalogs which have become part of pop culture or \u2018humanity\u2019s playlist\u2019 exhibit multi-decade income stability and in fact are growing under the paradigm shift from the  physical CD to global streaming as the iconic songs are being rediscovered, remixed, replayed and included on new platforms such as Amazon, Netflix and Tik Tok,\u201d commented Tim Gallagher, CEO.<\/p>\n<p>Music Royalties Inc. acquired its first catalog in 2018 and has paid out 43 dividends totalling over $6 million derived mostly from the streaming income of hit songs from numerous artist brands diversified by era and genre. MRI has more than tripled its 2019 dividend of $0.01 to $0.036 per share in 2023. Through ongoing accretive acquisitions of cash flow from rightsholders averaging 6-20% yields, MRI\u2019s long-term goal is to continue to increase its dividend, in order to deliver both increased income and capital growth.<\/p>\n<p>About Music Royalties Inc.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAlternative Non-Correlated Passive International Streaming Income Distributed Via Monthly Dividends<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMusic Royalties Inc. is an artist and investor partnership which provides direct exposure to music revenues from the hyper-growth in global streaming platforms by acquiring song royalties for our shareholders. Our goal is to increase share value by accumulating a diversified portfolio of cash flowing royalties which pay a monthly dividend.<\/p>\n<p>MRI&#8217;s goal is to democratize the ownership of music and build a virtual investment partnership between artists and their fans by making music and other entertainment income streams investable for individuals, ultimately by taking MRI public, which will continue the growth of our diversified portfolio, and open up this unique investment opportunity to a wider investor base, especially the fans.<\/p>\n<p>About Royalties Inc. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nRoyalties Inc. has a 2% stake in Music Royalties Inc.
