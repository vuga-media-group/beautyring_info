The Pennsylvania Course Materials Cost Survey, conducted in partnership with Bay View Analytics, collected 4,306 responses from students across 14 participating institutions during the spring and fall of 2023. Its goal is to understand the impact of course material choices on students&#8217; academic and general life.<\/p>\n<p>This project builds upon the groundwork laid by the Virginia Course Materials Survey and the Florida Student Textbook and Course Materials Survey, expanding and updating the survey to address the unique needs and challenges faced by Pennsylvania students. The survey also included a national sample, providing a benchmark for comparing Pennsylvania&#8217;s response rates to the broader trends in course material costs, academic choices, and preferences.<\/p>\n<p>Key findings from the Pennsylvania-focused survey include:<br \/>Most Students Worry about Course Material Costs: Nearly half of all students surveyed expressed a &#8220;moderate&#8221; or &#8220;extreme&#8221; level of concern regarding course material costs, highlighting widespread anxiety over this issue.<\/p>\n<p>Course Material Costs Adversely Affect Student Success: The survey revealed that course material costs have a detrimental impact on students&#8217; academic performance, leading to poor grades and forcing students to reduce the number of courses they take. Only 23% of students reported no impact on their academic career.<\/p>\n<p>Course Material Costs Affect Academic Choices: Many students indicated that decisions shaping their academic careers, such as their choice of institution, major, and minor, are influenced by material cost responsibilities and expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Students Actively Seek To Cut Costs: An overwhelming 98% of students have attempted at least one method to reduce the costs of course materials, including buying used copies, searching for a free online version of needed materials, or even going without required materials.<\/p>\n<p>Mixed Preferences for Digital and Print Materials: While 40% of students prefer print materials, 42% indicated that their preference varies depending on the course or that they have no particular preference. This demonstrates the diversity of student needs and learning styles.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis survey data will be incredibly helpful for higher education institutions working toward both greater affordability and greater equity for students, in PA and beyond,&#8221; said Elizabeth Nelson, a reference and instruction librarian at Penn State Lehigh Valley and a member of the Affordable Learning PA Steering Committee. &#8220;These findings will help us better contextualize ongoing efforts, so we can reduce costs for students, give faculty more control over course materials, and help students stay enrolled in college.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>ALPA and Bay View Analytics researchers will present the full results and insights from the Pennsylvania Course Materials Cost Survey at an <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/onlinelearningconsortium.org\/webinar\/course-materials-cost-students-more-than-money\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">upcoming webinar<\/a>, scheduled for January 18, 2024 at 1PM Eastern \/ 10AM Pacific.

These differences highlight the importance of research at the state and even individual institutional level.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The full report is available for download here: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bayviewanalytics.com\/course_materials.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.bayviewanalytics.com\/course_materials.html<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The completion of this survey marks the project\u2019s sixth and final year of its current grant-funded cycle.
