This commitment has earned it the trust and preference of both consumers and partners alike.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are pleased to deliver strong full-year results for 2023, as well as significant progress towards our goal to operate a nationwide network of 2,000 premier hotels by 2025 and establish the &#8216;Chinese Experience&#8217; as the industry benchmark,&#8221; said Mr.\u00a0Haijun Wang, Founder, Chairman and CEO of Atour.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond an uptake in financial figures, Atour also saw major business metrics rise rapidly in 2023.<\/p>\n<p>In 2023, the average revenue per available room (RevPAR) and average daily rate (ADR) of Atour hotels have both exceeded the levels for the same period in 2019, reaching <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB377<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB464<\/span>, up 44% and 19% year-over-year respectively.

Concurrently, there were 617 manachised hotels under development in its pipeline.<\/p>\n<p>In 2023, the domestic tourism market in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> continued to regain its vigor. Data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism shows that domestic travelers made 4.89 billion trips throughout the year, up 93.3% year on year, while tourist spending totaled <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB4.91 trillion<\/span>, a staggering 140.3% increase over the previous year.<\/p>\n<p>Amid the post-pandemic recovery, the tourism market is reverting to pre-pandemic levels, fueling a surge in demand for personalized experiences as well as an upgrade within the hospitality sector.<\/p>\n<p>Atour has led this transformation, capitalizing on its advantages in product innovation, operations, and digitalization.<\/p>\n<p>In line with its differentiation strategy , Atour introduced <span class=\"xn-person\">Atour Light<\/span> 3.0 in <span class=\"xn-chron\">February 2023<\/span>, a midscale offering that not only meets consumers&#8217; desire for quality accommodations and unique experiences, but also demonstrates its exceptional value proposition compared to similar brands in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>Since its launch, <span class=\"xn-person\">Atour Light<\/span> 3.0 has garnered 27 new hotel signings in the fourth quarter of 2023, with 25 already in operation.

These benefits span retail, dining, culture, arts, and sports, complementing the existing loyalty program. As of <span class=\"xn-chron\">December 31, 2023<\/span>, the number of registered members has surpassed 63 million, up 78% year-over-year.<\/p>\n<p>In broadening its product and market scope, Atour intents on exploring new opportunities in the retail sector. Drawing insights from guest feedback, it has introduced a line of deep-sleep-inspired amenities.<\/p>\n<p>This scenario-based retail business generated <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB1.14 billion<\/span> in GMV for full year 2023, marking a 298.3% year-over-year increase. Among the merchandise, cumulative sales of\u00a0Atour&#8217;s best-selling Deep Sleep Pillow PRO hit 1.2 million units, while consumers snapped up more than 100,000 Deep Sleep Temperature Control Quilts.<\/p>\n<p>The spike in sales underscores Atour&#8217;s ability to meet real user needs, enabling it to expand its competitive edge in the mid- to high-end price segments.<\/p>\n<p>From sleep-related products to other categories, its innovative approach has supplied the hospitality industry with a recipe for success.<\/p>\n<p>Atour&#8217;s digital capabilities underpin a seamless online-to-offline shopping experience, enhancing user satisfaction and unlocking greater potential for business growth.
