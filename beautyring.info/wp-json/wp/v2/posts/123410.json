The featured wine will be provided by world-renowned Il Borro, alongside Champagne Partner Taittinger and sweet treats by Sammontana Gelati.

Men&#039;s and Women&#039;s Collection of apparel, presented by Incom, is inspired by the colors and moods of the Mediterranean Sea and focuses on beautiful sun-washed colors and shades of blue, relaxed fits, and artisan materials. Consumers will also see amazing textures in menswear from lightweight woven shirts, like linen and seersucker, to light, cheerful colors and florals that exude a retro flare. U.S. Polo Assn. never strays far from its origins or its authentic connection to the sport of polo with the classic polo shirt. This season, consumers will find fun and fashionable variations, whether it&#039;s retro, stripes, color blocking or the most classic simple style. Polos look great on everyone, whether it&#039;s men, women or kids. For women, the polo dress is coming back in a big way, and you&#039;ll see feminine details like ruffles, embroidery, and eyelet fabrics. The brand&#039;s USPA Life product continues to grow with a focus on sustainable denim, the use of supima cotton, and more. The product is identifiable by labels and a logo promoting the colors of USPA Life - white, navy, and field green - the consumer&#039;s cue to our sustainably sourced product. For handbags this season, presented by Eastlab, consumers can expect the softest of leather and simple shapes, from warm caramel colors to pops of citrus like lime, yellow, pink and lavender. Beach and destination bags are made of natural fabrics like canvas and raffia or straw for a hand-crafted artisanal look. U.S. Polo Assn. logos and monograms alongside equestrian prints are a mainstay and look great on any fabric. Going from day into night, we see shimmering metallics that remind us that sporty is also elegant. Spring-Summer 2024 shoes presented by Bonis provide many new styles, offering new materials, colors, and innovative structures that respect the brand&#039;s philosophy while always paying close attention to the themes of quality, sport and authenticity. The collection is characterized by an expansion of both the casual and the sportier styles with an introduction of various new models that range from the more classic model to more urban and sportier. U.S. Polo Assn.&#039;s women&#039;s and men&#039;s new collection presents styles that underline the commitment to build on USPA LIFE, the sustainable initiative of the brand. The season&#039;s U.S. Polo Assn. Watch &amp; Jewelry Collection by EuroTrade is known for its sport-inspired, classic American style, and each season the designs reach a new level with unique details, shapes and colors. The Spring-Summer 2024 Collection combines new elements and stunning colors, from pastels to brights, with the key elements of our brand&#039;s heritage. Within the collection, customers will find a combination of natural gemstones, enamel elements, and colored crystals to create perfect summer essential accessories. Finally, the signature red, white and blue stripe is omnipresent for U.S. Polo Assn., from apparel, shoes, and accessories to store d\u00e9cor and game gear, because it&#039;s a pillar of the brand. Look for this accent embedded in much of the Spring-Summer Collection 2024. The EXECUTIVES: Alongside Nencini in Florence for Pitti week is J.

U.S. Polo Assn. never strays far from its origins or its authentic connection to the sport of polo with the classic polo shirt. This season, consumers will find fun and fashionable variations, whether it&#039;s retro, stripes, color blocking or the most classic simple style. Polos look great on everyone, whether it&#039;s men, women or kids. For women, the polo dress is coming back in a big way, and you&#039;ll see feminine details like ruffles, embroidery, and eyelet fabrics. The brand&#039;s USPA Life product continues to grow with a focus on sustainable denim, the use of supima cotton, and more.

For handbags this season, presented by Eastlab, consumers can expect the softest of leather and simple shapes, from warm caramel colors to pops of citrus like lime, yellow, pink and lavender. Beach and destination bags are made of natural fabrics like canvas and raffia or straw for a hand-crafted artisanal look. U.S. Polo Assn. logos and monograms alongside equestrian prints are a mainstay and look great on any fabric.

S. Polo Assn., the official brand of the United States Polo Association (USPA), presents its vibrant, sporty Spring-Summer Collection 2024 from June 13-16 at Pitti Immagine Uomo at the historic Fortezza da Basso in Florence. The U.S. Polo Assn. tagline, \"Play Your Part\" is all about teamwork and doing what's right in sports and in life. Perfectly matched with U.S. Polo Assn., \"Pitti Games\" is the theme that defines the style and atmosphere of this year's Pitti Immagine. The show's Creative Directors Leonardo Corallini and Angelo Figus emphasize \"play\" as the keyword, which is synonymous with energy, commitment, and a desire to succeed. These themes are shown consistently in the authentic style of U.S. Polo Assn. The EVENTS: Join U.S. Polo Assn. from June 13-16 at Booth 25 Cavaniglia, where the multi-billion-dollar sports brand will showcase its Spring-Summer Collection 2024, celebrating the brand's heritage in the sport of polo since 1890.

Nestled in the heart of Florence, where inspiration will surround this private, invitation-only event, the Torrigiani Garden is the largest private urban garden in Europe. This unforgettable night will feature a candlelit dinner served around a horseshoe table, and include a world-renowned artist, a remarkable horse whisperer, and conclude with one of the most popular rock bands in the region originating from Florence. The featured wine will be provided by world-renowned Il Borro, alongside Champagne Partner Taittinger and sweet treats by Sammontana Gelati. Last but not least, specialty branded Porsches, representing \"horsepower,\" will be exhibited and sponsored by Centro Porsche Firenze. The COLLECTION: The season's U.S. Polo Assn. Men's and Women's Collection of apparel, presented by Incom, is inspired by the colors and moods of the Mediterranean Sea and focuses on beautiful sun-washed colors and shades of blue, relaxed fits, and artisan materials. Consumers will also see amazing textures in menswear from lightweight woven shirts, like linen and seersucker, to light, cheerful colors and florals that exude a retro flare. U.S. Polo Assn. never strays far from its origins or its authentic connection to the sport of polo with the classic polo shirt. This season, consumers will find fun and fashionable variations, whether it's retro, stripes, color blocking or the most classic simple style. Polos look great on everyone, whether it's men, women or kids. For women, the polo dress is coming back in a big way, and you'll see feminine details like ruffles, embroidery, and eyelet fabrics. The brand's USPA Life product continues to grow with a focus on sustainable denim, the use of supima cotton, and more. The product is identifiable by labels and a logo promoting the colors of USPA Life - white, navy, and field green - the consumer's cue to our sustainably sourced product. For handbags this season, presented by Eastlab, consumers can expect the softest of leather and simple shapes, from warm caramel colors to pops of citrus like lime, yellow, pink and lavender. Beach and destination bags are made of natural fabrics like canvas and raffia or straw for a hand-crafted artisanal look. U.S. Polo Assn. logos and monograms alongside equestrian prints are a mainstay and look great on any fabric. Going from day into night, we see shimmering metallics that remind us that sporty is also elegant. Spring-Summer 2024 shoes presented by Bonis provide many new styles, offering new materials, colors, and innovative structures that respect the brand's philosophy while always paying close attention to the themes of quality, sport and authenticity. The collection is characterized by an expansion of both the casual and the sportier styles with an introduction of various new models that range from the more classic model to more urban and sportier. U.S. Polo Assn.'s women's and men's new collection presents styles that underline the commitment to build on USPA LIFE, the sustainable initiative of the brand. The season's U.S. Polo Assn. Watch & Jewelry Collection by EuroTrade is known for its sport-inspired, classic American style, and each season the designs reach a new level with unique details, shapes and colors. The Spring-Summer 2024 Collection combines new elements and stunning colors, from pastels to brights, with the key elements of our brand's heritage. Within the collection, customers will find a combination of natural gemstones, enamel elements, and colored crystals to create perfect summer essential accessories. Finally, the signature red, white and blue stripe is omnipresent for U.S. Polo Assn., from apparel, shoes, and accessories to store d\u00e9cor and game gear, because it's a pillar of the brand. Look for this accent embedded in much of the Spring-Summer Collection 2024. The EXECUTIVES: Alongside Nencini in Florence for Pitti week is J.

U.S. Polo Assn. will also be celebrating &quot;Live Authentically,&quot; an evening inspired by fashion, art, sports and music, on Wednesday, June 14, with a spectacular VIP Party in the magical Giarino Torrigiani. Nestled in the heart of Florence, where inspiration will surround this private, invitation-only event, the Torrigiani Garden is the largest private urban garden in Europe. This unforgettable night will feature a candlelit dinner served around a horseshoe table, and include a world-renowned artist, a remarkable horse whisperer, and conclude with one of the most popular rock bands in the region originating from Florence. The featured wine will be provided by world-renowned Il Borro, alongside Champagne Partner Taittinger and sweet treats by Sammontana Gelati. Last but not least, specialty branded Porsches, representing &quot;horsepower,&quot; will be exhibited and sponsored by Centro Porsche Firenze. The COLLECTION: The season's U.S. Polo Assn. Men's and Women's Collection of apparel, presented by Incom, is inspired by the colors and moods of the Mediterranean Sea and focuses on beautiful sun-washed colors and shades of blue, relaxed fits, and artisan materials. Consumers will also see amazing textures in menswear from lightweight woven shirts, like linen and seersucker, to light, cheerful colors and florals that exude a retro flare. U.S. Polo Assn. never strays far from its origins or its authentic connection to the sport of polo with the classic polo shirt. This season, consumers will find fun and fashionable variations, whether it's retro, stripes, color blocking or the most classic simple style. Polos look great on everyone, whether it's men, women or kids. For women, the polo dress is coming back in a big way, and you'll see feminine details like ruffles, embroidery, and eyelet fabrics. The brand's USPA Life product continues to grow with a focus on sustainable denim, the use of supima cotton, and more. The product is identifiable by labels and a logo promoting the colors of USPA Life - white, navy, and field green - the consumer's cue to our sustainably sourced product. For handbags this season, presented by Eastlab, consumers can expect the softest of leather and simple shapes, from warm caramel colors to pops of citrus like lime, yellow, pink and lavender. Beach and destination bags are made of natural fabrics like canvas and raffia or straw for a hand-crafted artisanal look. U.S. Polo Assn. logos and monograms alongside equestrian prints are a mainstay and look great on any fabric. Going from day into night, we see shimmering metallics that remind us that sporty is also elegant. Spring-Summer 2024 shoes presented by Bonis provide many new styles, offering new materials, colors, and innovative structures that respect the brand's philosophy while always paying close attention to the themes of quality, sport and authenticity. The collection is characterized by an expansion of both the casual and the sportier styles with an introduction of various new models that range from the more classic model to more urban and sportier. U.S. Polo Assn.'s women's and men's new collection presents styles that underline the commitment to build on USPA LIFE, the sustainable initiative of the brand. The season's U.S. Polo Assn. Watch &amp; Jewelry Collection by EuroTrade is known for its sport-inspired, classic American style, and each season the designs reach a new level with unique details, shapes and colors. The Spring-Summer 2024 Collection combines new elements and stunning colors, from pastels to brights, with the key elements of our brand's heritage. Within the collection, customers will find a combination of natural gemstones, enamel elements, and colored crystals to create perfect summer essential accessories. Finally, the signature red, white and blue stripe is omnipresent for U.S. Polo Assn., from apparel, shoes, and accessories to store d\u00e9cor and game gear, because it's a pillar of the brand. Look for this accent embedded in much of the Spring-Summer Collection 2024. The EXECUTIVES: Alongside Nencini in Florence for Pitti week is J.
