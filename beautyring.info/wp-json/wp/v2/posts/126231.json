TMCF member-schools include publicly supported Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs) which enroll over 80% of all students attending HBCUs. TMCF provides access to higher education through scholarships and financial support and prepares HBCU students to succeed in economically sustainable careers. These programs are particularly critical since over 75% of HBCU students are low-income, with 97% relying on financial aid \u2013 and over half are the first in their families to attend college.
