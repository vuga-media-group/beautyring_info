Incorporated into the resort&#8217;s elegant design, Fontainebleau Las Vegas&#8217; fine art collection embodies the brand&#8217;s decades-long love for creating thought-provoking and immersive displays and entertainment for its guests. The collection will be unveiled to the world at the resort&#8217;s grand opening on <span class=\"xn-chron\">Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2023<\/span>. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Art, architecture, and design are key components of our Fontainebleau culture and guest experience,&#8221; says Fontainebleau Development President <span class=\"xn-person\">Brett Mufson<\/span>. &#8220;The caliber of artists that we have collaborated with to create never-before-seen pieces that will be talked-about for generations is unprecedented. We are so proud to showcase them to the world and all Fontainebleau guests.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0Fontainebleau Las Vegas fine art collection brings together multiple ideas and disciplines, from larger-than-life murals to kinetic sculptures within the resort. Among the works curated exclusively for Fontainebleau Las Vegas:<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\"><b><i>Urs Fischer Gallery<br class=\"dnr\"><\/i><\/b><b>Artist: <span class=\"xn-person\">Urs Fischer<\/span><br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Fontainebleau Development has collaborated with Swiss-born artist <span class=\"xn-person\">Urs Fischer<\/span> to create the Urs Fischer Gallery at the resort&#8217;s south lobby entrance. Fischer, who has studios in <span class=\"xn-location\">Brooklyn<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles<\/span>, was selected by Fontainebleau Development to install a series of works exclusively for the resort.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\">Fischer&#8217;s <b><i>Lovers #3<\/i><\/b>, the centerpiece of the Fontainebleau Las Vegas south lobby, is a 46-foot sculpture crafted from aluminum, stainless steel, and gold leaf. A masterpiece-within-a-masterpiece which draws inspiration from movement and motion, <i>Lovers #3 <\/i>depicts two forms meeting, one balanced on top of the other, and it is designed to be viewed from multiple vantage points.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\">&#8220;<i>Lovers #3 <\/i>is the connective tissue that draws together a vast body of clever work, oscillating between the absurd and the unfeigned,&#8221; Fischer says. &#8220;It&#8217;s tender and torrid, enveloping and invigorating us through myriad emotions that invite us back into a post-lockdown world, where we seek to connect with individuals, experiences, and objects that genuinely feed our psyche.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\">Despite its monumental scale, Fischer&#8217;s work originates from the intimate act of shaping small pieces of clay by hand, a process he describes as a &#8220;sensual and repetitive gesture&#8221; before conscious intervention. Only one form, selected from hundreds, undergoes digital scanning and carving at full scale, preserving the nuanced tactility of the original maquette.<i> Lovers #3<\/i> emerged from a previous model, collaboratively chosen by Fischer and Fontainebleau Development.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\">Fischer has also been commissioned to paint two large-scale murals in the same area of the resort, seamlessly integrating them with the sculpture. Both the sculpture and murals draw inspiration from movement and motion, strategically designed for viewing from various vantage points, considering the long escalator and different entry points to the resort. Although the two paintings, titled <b><i>The Touch<\/i><\/b> and <b><i>The Eye<\/i><\/b>, mark Fischer&#8217;s first in this form, they are part of his broader body of work, the <i>Problem Paintings<\/i>. This series involves juxtaposing formal headshots with unconventional items like lightning bolts and fresh fruit, offering a unique interpretation of the representational systems governing our lives. Fischer maintains this playful juxtaposition in his Fontainebleau Las Vegas murals, with a backdrop featuring a headshot of a blonde woman whose face is obscured by a sizable hardboiled egg. The dynamic brush strokes outlining the woman&#8217;s face generate a sense of movement, guiding guests through the lobby space.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\">In explaining his choice of <span class=\"xn-location\">Las Vegas<\/span>, Fischer highlighted the city&#8217;s unique blend of old and new, which constantly evolves. He admires <span class=\"xn-location\">Las Vegas<\/span> for moving beyond the ostentatious hotels and <span>casinos<\/span>, embracing a more understated and timeless aesthetic embodied by the Fontainebleau name.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\"><b><i>Untitled (High Times), 2018-2019<br class=\"dnr\"><\/i><\/b><b>Artist: <span class=\"xn-person\">Richard Prince<\/span><br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Using a blend of oilstick, acrylic, charcoal, and ink jet, <span class=\"xn-person\">Richard Prince<\/span> brings his signature multi-colored roughly sketched figures to his piece, <i>Untitled 2018-2019,<\/i>\u00a0to the main lobby circulation of the resort. Prince&#8217;s contemporary art piece aims to evoke a sense of mental exhilaration through its dynamic composition of vibrant jewel-toned paint while offering a satirical and humorously critical perspective on the interpretation of American culture. Prince&#8217;s work embodies Fontainebleau&#8217;s storied legacy of pushing artistic boundaries and embracing provocative creations, inviting guests to engage with the unexpected and redefine their perceptions of contemporary art.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\"><b><i>History of Suspended Time<br class=\"dnr\"><\/i><\/b><b>Artist: <span class=\"xn-person\">Gonzalo Lebrija<\/span><br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Located at the southwest <span>casino<\/span> entrance of the resort, <span class=\"xn-person\">Gonzalo Lebrija&#8217;s<\/span> <i>History of Suspended Time<\/i>\u00a0is a sculpture that marks the physical and permanent realization of an earlier performance during which the artist hoisted a restored Valiant Duster above a lake with a crane and then dropped the car into the water while filming it with a high-speed camera, catching the moment just before the car broke the lake&#8217;s surface. Depicting the massive car delicately poised on the surface of the water, <i>History of Suspended Time<\/i> creates an uncanny, even sublime, effect, and encourages visitors to think about the automobile as a symbol of modern life and human aspiration. Born in <span class=\"xn-location\">Mexico City<\/span>, Lebrija&#8217;s work spans multiple mediums as the artist looks for ways to communicate through thought-provoking structures and frozen frames.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\">The inclusion of <i>History of Suspended Time<\/i>\u00a0aligns seamlessly with the rich tapestry of Fontainebleau&#8217;s iconic visual language and the brand&#8217;s legacy as the pinnacle of luxury. The 2,500-pound 1966 Ford Galaxie is positioned strategically to welcome visitors into the space, an image of impossibility come to life \u2013 much in the same way Fontainebleau Las Vegas has overcome impossibility to become reality. The sculpture not only explores the concept of the suspension of time, but creates a thought-provoking, multi-layered narrative, adding to Fontainebleau&#8217;s commitment to curating striking and unique imagery that creates an unforgettable, visually engaging experiences.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\"><b><i>Oceans<br class=\"dnr\"><\/i><\/b><b>Artist: BREAKFAST<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b><span class=\"xn-location\">Brooklyn<\/span>-based BREAKFAST conceived this interactive kinetic art sculpture \u2013 a single arch with movements and transitions that are triggered by real-time data of ocean tides from around the globe \u2013 for the southwest entrance to the Fontainebleau Las Vegas <span>casino<\/span>. The inspiration was to &#8220;bring water to the desert&#8221; just as Fontainebleau has brought its legacy from <span class=\"xn-location\">Miami<\/span> to <span class=\"xn-location\">Las Vegas<\/span>. The curved form of the sculpture mimics the shape of the Fontainebleau Miami Beach, while the materials used \u2013 marble and brass-tinted steel \u2013 draw from same design ethos of the iconic 1950s property.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\"><i>Oceans<\/i>\u00a0merges art and real-time data, portraying the ever-shifting tides globally. Utilizing &#8220;brixels,&#8221; innovative spinning bricks, aligns with the studio&#8217;s signature, combining geometric precision with organic movements. The sculpture&#8217;s dynamic waves, fueled by real-time Application Programming Interface (API) data, offer a holistic representation of Earth&#8217;s aquatic rhythms. As a milestone in BREAKFAST&#8217;s journey with Brixels, <i>Oceans<\/i> symbolizes their largest and most accessible work, promising to captivate a diverse audience with its sensory voyage and emotional resonance.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\"><b><i>Mirage<br class=\"dnr\"><\/i><\/b><b>Artist: <span class=\"xn-person\">Ivan Navarro<\/span><br class=\"dnr\"><\/b><span class=\"xn-person\">Ivan Navarro&#8217;s<\/span> <i>Mirage<\/i>, located at the base of the Fontainebleau Las Vegas pool district escalators, deftly blurs the lines between art and architecture. Known for his innovative work with glass tubes, mirrors, and lighting, the Chilean-born, <span class=\"xn-location\">Brooklyn<\/span>-based Navarro delves into the unresolved aspects of minimalism. His pieces challenge traditional boundaries, transforming space into doorways to the unknown, offering a profound exploration of space, territory, and perceptions, all informed by his personal experiences with exile. Mirage beckons viewers to question the distinctions between public and private, accessible and forbidden spaces.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\">By integrating Navarro&#8217;s thought-provoking piece into the fabric of the resort, Fontainebleau continues its legacy of being a trailblazer in the fusion of art and hospitality. The installation serves as a living expression of the brand&#8217;s dedication to providing guests with immersive, cutting-edge experiences that transcend conventional norms. As Fontainebleau has consistently set the stage for cultural innovation, Mirage stands as an emblem of the brand&#8217;s forward-thinking ethos, inviting patrons to engage with art in a way that is both provocative and profound.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prnml40\"><b><i>La Liaison Amouresuse<br class=\"dnr\"><\/i><\/b><b><span class=\"xn-person\">Tim Tadder<\/span><br class=\"dnr\"><\/b><span class=\"xn-person\">Tim Tadder<\/span> \u2014 whose art is described as &#8220;1950s nostalgia created by the most contemporary medium&#8221; \u2014 created 38 works for Fontainebleau Las Vegas using Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool to craft a narrative and manipulative generative imagery and bring his vision to life. The works, depicting people in vintage settings with fantastical colorful elements created with AI, are a unique representation of the Fontainebleau brand, bridging the historic <span class=\"xn-location\">Miami<\/span> property and its inspiration in the Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau in <span class=\"xn-location\">France<\/span> with the future of the new, modern Fontainebleau Las Vegas.<\/p>\n<p>Photography plays a pivotal role in the Fontainebleau Las Vegas art experience, with the works of Fontainebleau Development Chief Brand and Design Officer <span class=\"xn-person\">Peter Arnell<\/span> featured throughout the resort&#8217;s 3,644 rooms and suites. The collection also includes art by <span class=\"xn-person\">Julian Lorber<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Jean Alexander Frater<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Kate Blacklock<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Eric Moore<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Jessie Bloom<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Nicholas Biddle<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Lynn Dunham<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Zoe Pawlak<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Jonathan Todryk<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Jessica Poundstone<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Sebastiaan Knot<\/span>, Greg Minah, <span class=\"xn-person\">Anna Sidi Yacoub<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Alyson Fox<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Michael Banks<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Rica Belna<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Alexandra Lyon<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Cassie Suche<\/span>, and renowned glass and lighting artists Barovier&amp;Toso.
