This extension provides even more opportunities for guests to experience the interactive and immersive journey through the story of the Titanic during the summer months. Exhibition producer, Imagine Exhibitions, announces the extension following extraordinary ticket sales for the initial and first extended exhibition run dates, highlighting the timeless global fascination with the Titanic&#8217;s story.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are thrilled to announce yet another extension of Titanic: The Exhibition due to the incredible demand and overwhelming response from our guests. This exhibition not only provides a deeply immersive and emotional journey through one of history\u2019s most captivating stories but also continues to draw a diverse audience from around the globe. We are committed to offering unique, enriching experiences, and we\u2019re excited to give visitors even more time to explore the world of Titanic at Westfield Old Orchard.\u201d- Tom Zaller, President, Imagine Exhibitions. <\/p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s announcement coincides with the continued popularity of a combination ticket with Downton Abbey: The Exhibition also on view through Labor Day at the same location. The combination ticket provides access to both Titanic: The Exhibition and Downton Abbey: The Exhibition, located just across the lobby. This pairing offers a unique opportunity to explore two experiences from the Post Edwardian era, connected through the shared narrative of the Titanic&#8217;s tragic maiden voyage famously depicted in the first episode of Downton Abbey.<\/p>\n<p>About Titanic: The Exhibition<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nTitanic: The Exhibition is an interactive exhibition that tells the chronological and dramatic tale of the design, creation, launch, maiden voyage, and tragedy of the largest and most luxurious ship in the world at that time. Guests will admire hundreds of artifacts that encompass items that survived the sinking of the Titanic and her sister ships, as well as props and recreations of the costumes from the beloved James Cameron 1997 blockbuster film Titanic. Set inside fully immersive re-creations of the ship&#8217;s interior, the artifacts help navigate guests through Titanic&#8217;s timeline from sinking to underwater discovery.<\/p>\n<p>Once \u201caboard,\u201d visitors will receive a boarding pass corresponding with a passenger on the ship \u2013 allowing each guest to follow an individual passenger&#8217;s story as they explore the first, second, and third class galleries with their corresponding artifacts. The stories of love and loss culminate in the final galleries, showcasing personal effects and individual anecdotes surrounding a tribute wall where each passenger\u2019s fate is revealed. Music from the era plays throughout the exhibit as patrons examine incredibly detailed recreations of the ship&#8217;s interiors, including a two-story full-scale recreation of the ship\u2019s famous Grand Staircase, the first class hallway and millionaire&#8217;s suite, the third class hallway and cabin, the boiler room, and the ship exterior promenade deck complete with a starry night sky.<\/p>\n<p>The Discovery Gallery, dedicated to the discovery and research of the Titanic\u2019s wreckage site, features a raised glass floor, simulating the impression of walking along the ocean floor. Broken china in the sand allows visitors to experience some of what discovery teams saw during dives to the Titanic site.<\/p>\n<p>The exhibition also includes a striking and informative film that provides an in-depth look at the most recent forensic research related to the collision, breakup, and sinking of the Titanic, and award-winning underwater photography of the Titanic lines the walls of the Discovery Gallery in a stunning display of the ship\u2019s current state on the seafloor.<\/p>\n<p>Exhibition Details:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nExtension Dates: On sale now through September 2nd, 2024.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDownton Abbey | Titanic Combination Tickets: Available through September 2nd, 2024 on Saturdays and Sundays<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nLocation: Westfield Old Orchard, 4963 Old Orchard Road, Skokie, IL<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nTickets: Available for purchase online.
