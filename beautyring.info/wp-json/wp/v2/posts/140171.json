However, the irony is that we are using the same tools that caused the excesses of shareholder capitalism\u2014incentives and regulations\u2014to drive responsible behavior. Eighteenth-century economist Adam Smith cited profit as the incentive for businesses to create goods and services to serve society. He argued that free-market competition would ensure consumers get the best quality product at the cheapest price.<\/p>\n<p>Two hundred years later, Milton Friedman agreed in his 1970 New York Times op-ed that the sole responsibility of business is to maximize profits \u2018so long as it stays within the rules of the game\u2019. Incentives coupled with some regulations were meant to safeguard societal interests.<\/p>\n<p>But instead, incentives have created bad behavior. Regulations have been routinely bypassed with intelligent loopholes. Despite this\u2014to encourage sustainability today\u2014we are again using incentives and regulations. That\u2019s predominantly what the ESG framework focuses on. And what do we see? Rampant greenwashing and box-ticking.<\/p>\n<p>To address today\u2019s existential challenges, we need innovation, which can\u2019t be legislated nor driven by extrinsic incentives alone.  We need to take a values-driven approach . It\u2019s time for ESG to upgrade to ESL, where the \u2018L\u2019 stands for Steward Leadership. In ESL, \u2018G\u2019 is a subset of \u2018L\u2019. Steward leadership creates the ability to create a win-win-win future for stakeholders, society, and the environment. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs part of a global survey in 2023, we asked 10,000 respondents if they think current solutions will be enough to save us from the enormity of challenges we face today. The resounding answer was a big no,\u201d says Peshawaria. \u201cOur research that we discuss in the book shows that the missing link is genuine stewardship intent to \u2018do well by doing good.\u2019 The companies that are succeeding see themselves as stewards of humanity. The more they do it, the more they help the world, the more they will benefit as well.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Sustainable Sustainability lays out a practical, step-by-step playbook for any commercial entity that wants to succeed at marrying profit and purpose.<\/p>\n<p>For interview opportunities, please contact:<\/p>\n<p>Vicky Lynch, vicky@ktmediastrategies.com<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nKatie Riess, katie@ktmediastrategies.com<\/p>\n<p>####<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Vicky Lynch<br \/>KT Media Strategies<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/678649327\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=D9-TKKYsZe1Ou8Lj&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      January 03, 2024, 15:06 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/678649327\/sustainable-sustainability-calls-on-ceos-and-leaders-to-become-stewards-of-humanity-to-marry-profit-with-purpose\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
