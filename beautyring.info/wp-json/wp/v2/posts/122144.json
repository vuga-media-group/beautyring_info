And we go much beyond the stage, fusing the performance with new elements and even the world outside NJPAC. In so many ways, this project is about overcoming barriers and embracing change amid a disrupted world.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Producer Igor Alves says: &#8220;I hope audiences discover the EMERGE trilogy and treasure its unique sensibility and artistic and technical quality above all, while appreciating how it also advances diversity in the arts, in subtle yet powerful ways: the films star Xian, a Chinese female, conducting musical works by composers of color, in a film directed by Yuri, a Brazilian immigrant, also featuring dance performances by male and females of color.&#8221;  <\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nEMERGE: An NJ Symphony Concert Film Trilogy<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMusic Director Xian Zhang leads the New Jersey Symphony back on the main stage to masterfully conduct a striking selection of orchestral works, showcased in a uniquely intimate style by maverick filmmaker Yuri Alves. The EMERGE concert film trilogy expands the universe of orchestral music through a mix of live stage performance, stunning visuals, mesmerizing dance sequences and format-bending elements. The EMERGE Trilogy features world-renown guest performers such as Simone Dinnerstein, Inon Barnatan and superstar Daniil Trifonov, and special collaborators like dancer Cori Barnes, M.A. Taylor, Neguin and more. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/dreamplaymedia.com\/emerge\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">dreamplaymedia.com\/emerge<\/a><\/p>\n<p>YURI ALVES<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nYuri Alves is a multiple award-winning filmmaker who has written and directed films, primetime television programs and commercial projects in the U.S. and Europe.
