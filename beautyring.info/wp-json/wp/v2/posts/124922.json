But beneath the pleasant facade lies a wealth of chilling stories that have silently shaped the city&#8217;s history,\u201d said Jamie Green, producer and co-host. \u201cWith &#8216;Going to Killing City,&#8217; we aim to illuminate these oft-overlooked tales, exposing a side of Kansas City that will captivate listeners with elements of surprise and shock.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Recorded from the comfort of their home bars (\u2018The Green Room\u2019 and \u2018The Green Shebeen,\u2019 respectively), and paired with a killer cocktail recipe in each episode, Green and Greenwood offer a unique approach to the true crime genre. By blending humor with historical analysis, they aspire to not just entertain, but also to broaden listeners&#8217; understanding of Kansas City&#8217;s mysterious past.<\/p>\n<p>Each month, the co-hosts alternate roles, with one uncovering an intriguing KC crime story, while the other uses a brief clue to share a cocktail recipe that may\u2014or may not\u2014complement the secret crime story to be told. The first three episodes encompass narratives of gangland murders, a shocking serial killer, and a deadly, bizarre love triangle.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;History isn&#8217;t just about memorizing dates and events,&#8221; says co-host Greenwood. &#8220;It&#8217;s about grasping people\u2019s actions and their consequences. We narrate the stories in a light-hearted way, not delving into every angle of each crime. While some elements might be unfamiliar to those not from Kansas City, we believe our approach makes history interesting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Green added, \u201cWe have set a few ground rules. We do not cover murders that have happened within the past three decades, nor do we discuss any murders involving children.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While recognizing that murder is an unfortunate reality in Kansas City, as it is elsewhere in America, the duo is clear about their intent. \u201cWe distinguish between sharing a story with context and sensationalism. We\u2019re not glorifying violence or the ensuing grief. Instead, Jamie and I explore the peculiar circumstances of human behavior. Consider this an audio KC Crime Tour,\u201d Greenwood explained.<\/p>\n<p>Green is the owner of a full-service public policy consulting firm based in Kansas City.
