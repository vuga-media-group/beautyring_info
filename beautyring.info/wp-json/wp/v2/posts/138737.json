Tabb has plans to incorporate a permanent film and photographic studio later in the year and hopes that this is just the start of their work in offering further physical services to help its community make their projects happen.<\/p>\n<p>With consultation from low-carbon, innovative design and construction firm Agile Homes, the \u2018<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/tabb.cc\/hub\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Tabb Hub<\/a>\u2019 will use recycled and custom furniture to create unique and purpose-built spaces for its residents and community, including Bristol Production Van, Foxy Motion Films, Barri Films and FishPunch.<\/p>\n<p>The hub is open to enquiries and reservations from filmmakers and connected creative disciplines, whether individuals or teams, with flexibility regarding how residents can organise and set up the space.<\/p>\n<p>Known as \u2018Cahootify\u2019 until December last year, Tabb&#8217;s collaborative platform for independent filmmakers, producers and actors has gone from strength to strength. With regular events, festivals and screenings aiming to unite and empower South West filmmakers, Tabb\u2019s community has grown to 8,000 members. Rising stars and established professionals, such as Keith Wilhelm-Kopp, who recently released their debut feature film, Translations (2023), have added over 10,000 short films, animations, trailers and music videos to the platform, with many by teams that found each other through the Tabb opportunities and events.<\/p>\n<p>Sparks Bristol, a world-first project co-created by Global Goals Centre and ArtSpace LifeSpace, offers various indoor independent stalls and shops, from fashion and food to nature and energy, supporting people to make money-saving choices on climate, equality and wellbeing. Sparks Project Manager John Hosken said, \u201cWe are delighted that the collaborative and empowering Tabb organisation has taken the space &#8211; creating so much opportunity for both organisations.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Tabb CEO Pete Francomb, said: &#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to offer this exciting new space to Bristol filmmakers. The forward-thinking Sparks ethos matches Tabb&#8217;s commitment to supporting and enabling creatives. Tabb Hub is a perfect and logical move for the organisation and the community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tabb expects the hub to fill quickly due to the hub\u2019s prime central location and high demand for flexible and multi-use creative spaces.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Michael McCall<br \/>Tabb<br \/>mike@tabb.cc<br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tabbfacebook\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tabbpro\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/tabbpro\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tabbpro\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/tabb.cc\/hub\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Other<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=2zIoaqiCkLRwG56T&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      December 12, 2023, 00:29 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/674450383\/new-filmmakers-co-working-space-to-open-in-bristol-s-city-centre\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
