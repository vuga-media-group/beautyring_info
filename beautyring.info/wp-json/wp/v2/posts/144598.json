In his quest, he reunites an ensemble of fresh and familiar faces \u2013 together they fight off Angel, whose rationale to the gold leaves a trail of deception and dead bodies.<\/p>\n<p>With Van Peebles at the helm as director and starring in a lead role, the film captivated audiences with its blend of action, drama, and social commentary.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe can make Edutainment, we can make films that show our-story\u2013 not just his-story, but equally important, are film festivals run by conscious people that reflect us and give our movies a platform,\u201d said Van Peebles. \u201cThe Pan African Film Festival is our festival. It\u2019s run by our folks! I am truly honored and excited to premiere \u2018Outlaw Posse\u2019 as the closing night film. This festival holds a special place in my heart for its commitment to diverse storytelling, and I believe \u2018Outlaw Posse\u2019 aligns perfectly with the spirit of this celebration.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOutlaw Posse\u201d stars Mario van Peebles, Whoopi Goldberg, Cedric the Entertainer, John Carrol Lynch, Neil McDonough, Edward James Olmos, M.
