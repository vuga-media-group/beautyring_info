He has mostly the same medical team my parents shared and was even put into the same bed my dad passed away in after his resection for the duration of his recovery at the hospital. So, these words still hold true as we do this an unimaginable (and completely statistically impossible) third time.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The role of caregiver is something that anyone who hasn\u2019t experienced it will never truly understand. While people offer their best advice and support, being told to make time to care for oneself, for instance, doesn\u2019t help when the needs of parents and family are so acute. And caring for someone with a brain tumor is especially demanding for caregivers.<\/p>\n<p>After her beloved parents died, Laura Dill used her grief to start the Slay Society Inc. She also authored the incredibly helpful book for caregivers \u201cDaughter\u201d available on Amazon.com: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Daughter-Embracing-Difficult-Journey-Without-ebook\/dp\/B0992K2WGF\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Daughter-Embracing-Difficult-Journey-Without-ebook\/dp\/B0992K2WGF<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nLaura Dill resides in Ottawa, Canada, with her husband Kenny and her three children.
