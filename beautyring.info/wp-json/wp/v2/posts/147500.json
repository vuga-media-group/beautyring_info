In April 2023, Tech Guardian earned its MSSP credentials\u2014a major milestone for the company\u2014something Jarom and the Tech Guardian team have been working on since 2001. An MSSP is a specialized type of MSP that is specifically dedicated to security services. Besides the standard MSP security services, Tech Guardian offers more advanced services, such as threat intelligence (collecting and analyzing data to help make better cyber security decisions) and threat hunting (searching for cyber threats that may have already infiltrated a network but have not yet been detected by standard security systems).<\/p>\n<p>Tech Guardian provides its clients with a \u201cSolution Stack\u201d comprised of top-tier security tools from the world\u2019s most highly rated and respected security companies. What sets Tech Guardian apart from many regular MSPs is that they are fully compliant themselves with the various compliance frameworks they work with, including PCI (Payment Card Industry), CIS (Center for Internet Security), HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), FTC Safeguard (financial sector compliance) and CMMC (Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification). Plus, they are well-versed in each state\u2019s compliance laws to serve businesses in every state.<\/p>\n<p>Involved with technology since he was 15 when he built his first computer, Jarom has been in the IT Industry for over 27 years. At 17, he was working at Packard Bell doing tech support. Two years later, he was working for Microsoft. While attending college and touring different manufacturing companies, Jarom realized that small to medium-sized companies don\u2019t have nearly the level of technical sophistication that large companies do. So Jarom started JR-Tech in his spare time.<\/p>\n<p>Using a system called Smart Factory, he improved manufacturing companies\u2019 productivity by enabling communication with their computer-controlled machines. By the time he graduated, JR-Tech was a full-running company helping manufacturing companies improve their cybersecurity in California\u2019s Inland Empire. In 2020, they started offering compliance services. Jarom, who has an engineering degree from California State Polytechnical University\u2019s Pomona College of Engineering, uses the design engineering process to promote innovation, problem-solving, quality improvement, etc. In April 2023, upon becoming an MSSP, JR-Tech became Tech Guardian.<\/p>\n<p>Jarom is the author of \u2018Business IT 101: The Business Owner\u2019s Guide for Finding Hassle-free Computer Support\u2019 where he educates business owners to leverage technology for competitive advantage and business growth. He is a member of top IT associations and is active in local and national IT communities.<\/p>\n<p>Jarom has been a Boy Scout leader and mentor for 15 years. He volunteers with HOPE (Helping Our People in Elsinore) and is active in the community through church and civic service. He is an action sports enthusiast, loves the outdoors, and, above all, enjoys spending time with his wife and four boys. now.<\/p>\n<p>Media Contacts<\/p>\n<p>Scott Smith<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDirector of Marketing, Tech Guardian<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nscott.smith@tgmsp.com<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Jarom Renfeldt<br \/>Tech Guardian<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/698258645\/tel:+1 951-319-4040\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">+1 951-319-4040<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/698258645\/mailto:jarom.renfeldt@tgmsp.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">jarom.renfeldt@tgmsp.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=rG9K6aW3MdzZEHji&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      March 28, 2024, 10:05 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/698258645\/from-exposed-to-secure-book-is-now-available-a-new-cybersecurity-blueprint-for-businesses\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
