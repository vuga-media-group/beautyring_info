Founded in 2015 by Kevin Dolan and Paola Prestini, National Sawdust operates out of an intimate space, equipped with a state-of-the-art Meyer spatial sound system, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where it is one of the few remaining cultural venues. The New York Times has described National Sawdust as \u201cthe city\u2019s most vital new-music hall\u201d and as \u201ca triumphantly successful performance space that stands for a hip, sophisticated brand of new music.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>National Sawdust provides artists across musical genres and artistic disciplines with comprehensive support including commissions, workshops, residencies, public performances, recording, mentorship, and professional development. It aims to be not only a home for its community of artists, but also a place for audiences to discover wide-ranging music at accessible ticket prices. The institution\u2019s mentorship initiatives counteract industry barriers and the historic marginalization of diverse communities in the arts, providing artists and arts workers with guidance, resources, and relationships with established visionaries to accelerate their careers.<\/p>\n<p>Designed by Brooklyn\u2019s Bureau V, National Sawdust is constructed within the existing shell of a century-old sawdust factory, preserving the authenticity of Williamsburg\u2019s industrial past while providing a refined and intimate setting for the exploration of new music. At the venue\u2019s core is a flexible chamber hall, acoustically designed by renowned engineering firm Arup to provide the highest-quality experience of both unamplified and amplified music.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Danielle Morland<br \/>PA Group<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/664508352\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=v2619VeDnSnRyhoh&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      October 27, 2023, 06:43 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/664508352\/hearing-memory-an-artistic-journey-through-1970s-east-germany\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
