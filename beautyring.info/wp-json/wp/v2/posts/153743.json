However, one of the main restraints of heatless hair curlers is that they require users to keep them in their hair for several hours or overnight, which is a deterrent for some individuals. On the other hand, there is a large scope for innovation in the heatless hair curler market, as companies keep attempting to create new and improved products that are simpler to use and produce better results. <\/p>\n<p>Covid-19 Scenario: <\/p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic had both positive and negative impacts on the global heatless hair curlers market. <\/p>\n<p>Owing to COVID-19 restrictions, many people opted for at-home hair styling options while salons and beauty parlors were closed or only functioning to a certain capacity. As an alternative to conventional heat styling tools, this raised interest in heatless hair curlers. <\/p>\n<p>Global supply chains were interrupted by the pandemic, which caused a shortage of raw materials and delays in the production and distribution of heatless hair curlers. This made it challenging for producers to meet demand, which led to higher costs for some products. <\/p>\n<p>LIMITED-TIME OFFER \u2013 Buy Now &amp; Get Exclusive 15 % Discount on this Report @ <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/checkout-final\/1e1f2378f4e2bee869f25c0fb8b53b96\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/checkout-final\/1e1f2378f4e2bee869f25c0fb8b53b96<\/a>  <\/p>\n<p>The foam rollers segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period <\/p>\n<p>By on type, the foam rollers segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for nearly two-fifths of the global heatless hair curler market revenue and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period.
