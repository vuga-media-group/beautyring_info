The memorial, created by Benjamin Victor, is a stunning bronze sculpture that captures the essence of Dr. Peck&#8217;s passion and talent. It serves as a reminder of his contributions to the arts community in Boise and beyond. The matching fund will provide crucial support for the completion of this important piece of art. The concept to full size clay at 150% of life size has been completed and is ready to be molded and cast in bronze.<\/p>\n<p>This is an incredible opportunity for the community to come together and support the arts in Boise.

This is a chance to honor the legacy of Dr. Peck and show our support for the arts in our city. We encourage everyone to rise up and join us in this effort to preserve and celebrate the arts.<\/p>\n<p>The Dr. Peck Legacy is grateful for the support of the community and is excited to see the impact of this matching fund. Donations can be made online or by mail, and all contributions will be matched dollar for dollar up to $25,000.
