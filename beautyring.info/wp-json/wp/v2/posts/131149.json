Both awareness and use of OER\u2014which are openly licensed and thus free to use, edit, and share\u2014jumped by seven percentage points compared to the 2021-22 school year, reaching their highest levels seen in the 12 years the survey has been administered. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cFaculty are concerned about students being able to afford course materials, and they\u2019re much more comfortable finding and using resources like downloadable OER after the pandemic,\u201d said Julia Seaman, who led the survey for Bay View Analytics. \u201cEven as many courses return to in-person learning, it\u2019s clear that the flexibility of OER is catching on with instructors.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>The survey also found that digital tools and course materials have become increasingly prevalent in higher education classrooms, as 88% of faculty who use a textbook offer it in digital format. Educators and administrators report that digital tools offer appreciable flexibility for students and instructors alike, and their pricing can be competitive with traditional print materials.<\/p>\n<p>Other key findings from the survey include:<br \/>\u2022\tFaculty are most commonly using digital tools, like digital textbooks and homework software, to replace print tools like physical textbooks and homework handouts. But a small number of faculty are also utilizing new tools that have no physical counterpart, such as digital collaboration tools and student progress monitors. <br \/>\u2022\tFaculty are generally satisfied with the overall quality of their curricula, as 50% gave their curricula a grade of either an A or B.<br \/>\u2022\t62% of faculty agree that the cost of course materials is a serious problem for their students.<br \/>\u2022\tAlthough reported use of inclusive access programs \u2014 also known as automatic purchase programs \u2014 remains steady, there appears to be confusion around them, as 51% of faculty said they were not aware of these programs, compared to 44% who said they were unaware in 2021-22.<\/p>\n<p>These results are part of an annual survey of educators and administrators conducted by Bay View Analytics, tracking curricula adoption decisions in higher education in the U.S. The project is supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and Online Learning Consortium.
