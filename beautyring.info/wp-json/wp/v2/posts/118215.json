The story also spotlights &#8220;Camelot\u2019s&#8221; creators: the beleaguered librettist Alan Jay Lerner, who\u2019s sidelined with ulcers in Toronto; the bemused composer Frederick \u201cFritz\u201d Loewe; and the brilliant director Moss Hart, who suffers a coronary in Toronto and quits, leaving the sinking ship without a captain.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCamelot was a train wreck on the road,\u201d says Eisenberg. \u201cWhile the score was gorgeous, Lerner was besieged by health and marital problems and couldn\u2019t wrangle a smooth adaptation of T.H. White\u2019s Arthurian saga, &#8216;The Once and Future King.&#8217; Opening night in Toronto ran nearly four hours, with one wag calling it \u2018Gotterdammerung without laughs.\u2019 This was a shaky start, since the critics expected a gleaming successor to &#8216;My Fair Lady.&#8217; As the show limped on to Boston without Moss Hart, Lerner and Loewe fell out over Lerner\u2019s decision not to replace the director, and &#8216;Camelot&#8217; became their Broadway swan song.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Eisenberg feels the show\u2019s out-of-town travails are the ideal backdrop for a rom-com as her protagonists, Jane and Bryce, try to juggle unending work and relationship woes. After the company heads back to Broadway for its premiere, bad reviews nearly derail &#8220;Camelot&#8221; until a show-biz \u201cmiracle\u201d saves the musical.  \u201cJust about everything I wrote about &#8216;Camelot&#8217; itself really happened,\u201d Eisenberg adds. <\/p>\n<p>Before turning to fiction, Eisenberg was a publicist and marketeer for Goodspeed Opera House, Syracuse Stage, and the Joffrey Ballet. She formed a promotional writing company in Washington, D.C., and published articles in Classical Singer, Huffington Post, and Opera News. A graduate of Michigan State University and longtime member of the Authors Guild, she published her first novel, &#8220;The Voice I Just Heard,&#8221; in 2012. Based in Baltimore, she\u2019s now finishing her third novel about American markswoman Annie Oakley. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One More Seat at the Round Table&#8221; is available now at Amazon. It has received glowing advance praise:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA delightful discovery awaits all who are smart enough to purchase &#8216;One More Seat at the Round Table&#8217; and succumb to its inherent pleasures. It&#8217;s a love story for all who are curious about the American musical form as it delves accurately into the intricate evolution from the rehearsal process to a series of opening nights ultimately landing on Broadway. And Eisenberg is a vivid storyteller.\u201d <br \/>Joseph V. Melillo, executive producer emeritus, Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Five stars. Captivating historical fiction&#8230;that I recommend to anyone who enjoys a good love story, musical theater, and history.&#8221;<br \/>Literary Titan Reviews<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAn utterly engrossing, hilarious, and often tender novel of how one hundred-plus creative people made Broadway\u2019s legendary, much-loved &#8216;Camelot&#8217; from scraps and sheer determination.\u201d <br \/>Stephanie Cowell, author of &#8220;The Boy in the Rain&#8221; and &#8220;Claude &amp; Camille&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/One-More-Seat-Round-Table\/dp\/1639888020\/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1680795140&amp;sr=8-2\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/One-More-Seat-Round-Table\/dp\/1639888020\/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1680795140&amp;sr=8-2<\/a>\t \t\t\t<\/p>\n<p>One More Seat at the Round Table<br \/>Paperback: 358 pages\t\t\t\t\t\t             <br \/>ISBN 9781639888023 \t\t\t\t\t<br \/>US $17.99<br \/>Ebook: <br \/>ASIN B0C1M56V1J<br \/>US $7.99<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.atmospherepress.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Atmosphere Press is an independent, full-service publisher<\/a> for excellent books in all genres and for all audiences.
