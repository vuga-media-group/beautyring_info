Scheduled from Friday, August 18th, through Sunday, August 20th, the Ford Film Festival pays tribute to the remarkable impact of the Ford brothers on world cinema. Francis Ford, an early pioneer in silent films and serials, also mentored his brother John, who became the most Oscar-winning director in Academy Awards history. His record four \u201cBest Director\u201d awards still stands today.  <\/p>\n<p>In their hometown of Portland, Maine, the brothers were known as Frank and Jack \u201cBull\u201d Feeney. Born to Irish Immigrants from Spiddal in County Galway, as young boys, they lived in St. Dominic\u2019s parish in Portland&#8217;s West End, the heart of the Irish immigrant community, now home to the Maine Irish Heritage Center and the John and Francis Ford Collection. <\/p>\n<p>The <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/fordfilmfestival.com\/program\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">festival program<\/a> offers many opportunities that appeal to devoted film enthusiasts and those seeking an enjoyable summer weekend activity. A highlight of the event will be the premieres of three recently restored silent films by Francis Ford, offering audiences a rare glimpse into these long-hidden cinematic treasures.  Throughout the weekend, attendees will also have the opportunity to enjoy John Ford classics, culminating in a free outdoor screening of THE QUIET MAN in Monument Square.  <\/p>\n<p>Renowned film scholars, experts, and Ford family members will deliver lectures and symposiums exploring the lives and works of the Ford brothers, providing invaluable insights into their cinematic contributions. Walking history tours across the city will also immerse guests in early twentieth-century Portland, offering a unique perspective on the city\u2019s heritage and evolution.  <\/p>\n<p>Joseph McBride, renowned film historian, Ford biographer, and Ford Film Festival keynote speaker, said, \u201cJohn Ford is widely considered America\u2019s, and perhaps the world\u2019s, greatest filmmaker, and he said he learned virtually everything from his brother Francis. These two Irish American sons of Portland proudly returned frequently to their hometown, and their work continues to do honor to their roots in both Portland and Ireland.\u201d McBride, who is the author of Searching for John Ford (2001) and co-author (with Michael Wilmington) of John Ford (1974), added, \u201cThe John and Francis Ford Film Festival will be a happy and important occasion for people who love movies to gather and celebrate their work and heritage, while coming to a deeper understanding of how Portland made them who they were, and helped make John Ford into America\u2019s national poet. Francis\u2019s pioneering work has long been neglected but will be featured as well as Jack\u2019s in some new rediscoveries and restorations.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The John and Francis Ford Film Festival offers various ticket options, including individual event passes and all-access festival passes.
