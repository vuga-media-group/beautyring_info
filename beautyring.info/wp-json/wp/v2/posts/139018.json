In 2019, the test pool was successfully brought to life, prompting an invitation to investor and tech executive <span class=\"xn-person\">Vinny Smith<\/span> to experience the wave.<\/p>\n<p>Smith brought in hotel developers <span class=\"xn-person\">Tim and Colin O&#8217;Byrne<\/span> to help create the incredible destination it is today.\u00a0 Cheyne&#8217;s\u00a0previous experience of operating the surf experience at the pool in <span class=\"xn-location\">Waco<\/span> was also pivotal in creating the park.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Opening The Palm Springs Surf Club marks the realization of a dream that was once unimaginable &#8211; catching waves in the desert. We have assembled a passionate team to create an extraordinary space that will provide world-class entertainment and bring together people from within and beyond the surf community. Much appreciation goes out to the hundreds of people who worked on the site over the past couple of years. This team took a dilapidated park that was built in the late 1970s and created what you see today. To make things even more challenging, Cheyne, Tim and Colin drove this effort during the COVID years, an extremely difficult time to complete such a huge project,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Vinny Smith<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Tim O&#8217;Byrne<\/span>, developer of The Palm Springs Surf Club, expressed his enthusiasm: &#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to bring this unique desert surf experience to life. Whether you&#8217;re an avid surfer, a beginner, or someone who simply loves to watch this spectacular sport, The Palm Springs Surf Club has something for everyone. Surfing is a mesmerizing sport to watch, and at PSSC, the experience of observing surfers ride world-class waves against the stunning backdrop of the Palm Springs Mountains is unparalleled. We&#8217;ve invested over <span class=\"xn-money\">$80 million<\/span> to turn this park into a top-tier entertainment destination.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Situated just a short drive from <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles<\/span> and minutes away from downtown <span class=\"xn-location\">Palm Springs<\/span>, PSSC spans 21 acres and combines the finest features of resort and leisure attractions, creating a vibrant community-based destination centered around surfing and the beach lifestyle. While the motto emphasizes that surfing can be for everyone, non-surfers are also catered to with a range of additional attractions and offerings. Enhancing the visitor experience, large LED displays are strategically placed throughout the club, capturing and projecting the dynamic surf action, allowing guests to immerse themselves in the excitement.<\/p>\n<p>PSSC is redefining the surf pool landscape with its advanced pneumatic wave technology, pioneered by industry veteran <span class=\"xn-person\">Tom Lochtefeld<\/span>, the founder of Surfloch Wave Systems. This innovative technology offers on-demand, customizable waves designed by expert surfers to cater to varying skill levels, ensuring a memorable surfing experience for all. Accommodating up to 25 surfers simultaneously, the park&#8217;s waves are not only pre-programmed for individual preferences but are also a testament to sustainable practices. PSSC stands out for using just 1% of the water volume required by a typical golf course while generating over 70% of its energy resources in-house.<\/p>\n<p>Though crowds will come out to surf and watch the waves, guests visiting the facility (ADA-accessible) will also have access to a lazy river, waterslide attractions (opening later in 2024), cabana rentals, and more. Amala restaurant will provide sustainable eating options that will fuel a day of surfing and play. The open indoor\/outdoor design is the perfect place to relax and take in the club&#8217;s desert surroundings. Three full bars with custom cocktails and beers on draft will round out the beverage offerings on-site. Guests are welcome to visit Amala for the restaurant experience and forgo the park entrance fee. Those hitting the waves or lounging poolside can also grab a quick bite at Drifter&#8217;s, the club&#8217;s second restaurant on-site. The retail store will have a curated selection of wetsuits, clothing, and accessories.<\/p>\n<p>A wide selection of rental boards will be available for surf session reservations with a variety of boards available for purchase as well. Riding the wave starts at <span class=\"xn-money\">$100<\/span> for beginners (group of 12), <span class=\"xn-money\">$150<\/span> for intermediates (group of 12), and <span class=\"xn-money\">$200<\/span> for the advanced (group of 9).
