Music Project (AMP) writes anthemic rock songs inspired by video game characters. They have written songs that would be classified as Rock, Alternative Rock, Indie Rock, Celtic Rock, Funk Rock, Hard Rock or even Metal, depending on the video game character they are writing about. The first three albums released were specifically inspired by the characters in the battle royale game APEX Legends from Electronic Arts. Some of their releases have been inspired by the likes of Kratos from God of War, Donkey Kong in It\u2019s On Like Donkey Kong, Bowser in The Conqueror, Yoshi in That\u2019s Me, Jill Valentine from Resident Evil in Burn It All Down, Joel from The Last of Us in She\u2019s The Key, Cloud from Final Fantasy VII in Help Me, and Mr. and Mrs. Pac-Man in Eating Ghosts.

They have collaborated with ARANDA, a rock band formed by two brothers Dameon and Gabe Aranda back in 2001. The project has also collaborated with talented singers such as Pete Mitchell with No More Kings, Lacy Saunders, Joel Driskell, Adam Aguillar, Macie Cantrell, Hartleigh Buwick, Myra Beasley, Chris Jackson from Coupe Marra and YZMN.
