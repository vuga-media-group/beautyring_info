Based on an original feature screenplay, the intended feature film property is now out to industry, seeking acquisition, development partnering, and financing opportunities. <\/p>\n<p>Last year was a banner year for \u201cBrothers in Arms,\u201d the short film was honored with a Best Film Award at LANNEFF after a Best Cinematography Award at Swedish International Film Festival, and nominated for Best International Short Film, Best Director, and Best Actor for <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.actorjordancharles.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Jordan Charles<\/a>. It was most recently nominated for Best Thriller\/Action Film at Golden Gate International Film Festival, and recognized as an Official Selection at both Hollywood ShortsFest and Capri, Hollywood International Film Festival. <\/p>\n<p>The finalized screenplay represents a sophisticated crime saga, drawing inspiration from films like &#8220;Heat,&#8221; &#8220;The Departed,&#8221; and &#8220;No Country For Old Men.&#8221; Its cinematic vision, characterized by a compelling narrative and a focus on strong casting, anticipates broad international appeal and positioning as a prestige title.<\/p>\n<p>Actor-producer Jordan Charles wrote the original feature story on spec, then self-financed the short film as executive producer, co-director, and lead actor, hiring 130 cast and crew in the effort. Like multi-hyphenates before him, Charles catalyzed powerful storytelling and acting to exact a compelling drama, drawing on the influence of peers like Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Donald Glover, and Greta Gerwig.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are many challenges to original stories gaining development, so I stopped waiting for doors to open, and instead followed the path taken by other actor-writers I respected like Affleck and Damon to guide me,\u201d said filmmaker and star Charles. \u201cThere\u2019s strength in believing in your voice. We\u2019re setting out to create a seminal feature crime drama that will entertain and resonate with international audiences on a profound, heartfelt level.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>First screened at AFM, the project\u2019s buzz continues heading into its European Film Market premiere on February 21, 2024 in Berlin. High sentiment for the feature film\u2019s development has endured with audiences. \u201cI would love to see what Charles can accomplish with a longer runtime and a more substantial budget,\u201d said Chris Jones of Overly Honest Movie Reviews. \u201cSeeing how well this short film was done was awe-inspiring, so I have incredibly high hopes to see what he could do with more.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Next up for Annabill Artist Productions: Charles, who is Founding Producer, has four finished feature film screenplays in the pipeline as acting vehicles, ready for development talks, including a mystery drama-thriller concerning the polarizing migrant crisis, and an epic adventure surrounding a secret artifact in the mold of Indiana Jones and National Treasure. Both projects are in early development, likely to follow the nearing feature development of the \u201cBrothers In Arms\u201d feature film.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about \u201cBrothers in Arms\u201d visit: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.watchbrothersinarms.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.watchbrothersinarms.com<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p># # #<\/p>\n<p>Interested parties are invited to contact Annabill Artist Productions to watch the award-winning short film, and request for the feature film screenplay.<\/p>\n<p>About Annabill Artist Productions<br \/>Annabill Artist Productions is a Los Angeles-based production company that originates its own feature film content with original screenplay material, for acquisition and development partnering.
