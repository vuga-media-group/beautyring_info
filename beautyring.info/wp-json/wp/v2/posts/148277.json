The groundbreaking approach to fixing the growing wait (3,000 new patients are added to the list each month) involves storytelling through one of the world\u2019s favorite entertainment mediums \u2014 film.<\/p>\n<p>End The Wait Foundation welcomes the public to join its mission to utilize film to educate and recruit kidney donors to save those 100,000 lives. Combining the numbers game and education campaign, if enough people learn of the true story of Randy Simpkins donating his kidney to Russell Dallas, as well as the general ease of sharing one\u2019s superpower to save a life through kidney donation, End The Wait is poised to eliminate the waitlist.<\/p>\n<p>Simpkins, founder of End the Wait, is teaming with actor Dean Cain, writer-director Lance Dreesen and actress-writer Kelly Collins Lintz. They have lived a miraculous story of connection that comes full circle through storytelling, kindness and giving back in the ultimate way. <\/p>\n<p>The worst-turned best day of Simpkins\u2019 life was documented in the 2010 feature film \u201cThe Way Home,\u201d a re-telling of the ordeal when his and wife Christal\u2019s then 2-year-old son went missing. The rural town rallied to search, and the triumph of the family reuniting changed many involved, including Simpkins, who sought higher purpose. <\/p>\n<p>A decade later, Simpkins, a Gulf War veteran who had since became a pastor, overheard Lucretia Dallas sharing a desperate prayer for a kidney for her husband, Russell Dallas. Simpkins decided to get tested, and despite being told chances were 1 in 10,000, he was the perfect match in more ways than one. He wound up donating his kidney to the man he\u2019d only met right before the procedure, saving Dallas\u2019 life, and then set off on his new mission with End The Wait to save even more.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis cause makes this different, the fact that we\u2019re putting proceeds from the movie back into the nonprofit,\u201d Simpkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s a movie being made like no other with a purpose like no other.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Simpkins is partnering with Cain, who portrayed Simpkins in \u201cThe Way Home,\u201d and Dreesen, who wrote and directed that film. Cain and Dreesen will again take on those roles for \u201cEnd The Wait,\u201d which will detail the beautiful discovery and success of Simpkins donating his kidney to Dallas.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo make a movie to save people\u2019s lives specifically is completely unique and there can be no higher calling,\u201d Cain said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic so I\u2019m all in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Simpkins, Cain and Dreesen know the movie and the nonprofit will have an impact for the 100,000 people waiting for a kidney. Thirteen of them die every day due to the worldwide critical shortage of donors. Donations now can help the film get made faster, and proceeds from the movie will be invested back into the nonprofit to aid in creating additional awareness above and beyond the film, as well as providing support to the donors and recipients. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis has never been done before, the film isn\u2019t just illuminating a problem, the film is the solution to the problem,\u201d Dreesen said. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know the waitlist is 100,000 and the fact that the list can be wiped out.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Those interested in donating or learning more about End The Wait and kidney donation can visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/endthewait.net\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">endthewait.net<\/a>, email info@endthewait.net and connect on Facebook at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/endthewaitfilm\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">facebook.com\/endthewaitfilm<\/a> <\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Amanda Abelita<br \/>Abelita PR<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/702274294\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>+1 614.354.3322<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=4WUyeuddj_mHkFuB&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      April 09, 2024, 13:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/702274294\/filmmakers-team-with-actor-dean-cain-nonprofit-end-the-wait-to-eradicate-kidney-donation-waitlist\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
