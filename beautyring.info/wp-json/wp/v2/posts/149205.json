The interview, which appears in the magazine&#8217;s &#8220;Finding &amp; Living with Purpose&#8221; section, centers on how Cossolotto discovered his life&#8217;s purpose. <\/p>\n<p>Cossolotto\u2019s career spans the corridors of power and influence on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 as a former speechwriter for top leaders at NATO headquarters in Brussels, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Chancellor of UCLA, senior executives of several Fortune 100 corporations, and as a legislative aide to former Congressman Leon Panetta. <\/p>\n<p>Bold Journey Magazine highlights &#8220;stories that help you reach your full potential.&#8221; The magazine&#8217;s mission &#8220;is to create a space for all of us to learn from each other.  We believe the stories, experiences and insights of our neighbors, friends and peers are worth more than all the wealth in the world as these stories are the most relevant and authentic sources of wisdom&#8230; There is so much we can learn from each other and we hope these stories inspire you to pursue your passion and support those who are doing so themselves.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Finding His Purpose<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt from Cossolotto\u2019s Bold Journey interview in response to a question about how he found his purpose:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew early on that my purpose would involve writing in some capacity. For various reasons \u2014 some based on kismet or serendipity \u2014 I gravitated toward speechwriting as a professional focus. Some speech coaching opportunities soon followed. Early in my speechwriting and speech coaching career, I began to explore ways to empower my clients to enhance what I call their PodiumPower! I soon created The Power of SPEECH\u2014The Six-Point Checklist for Powerful Presentations. I began to use that handy checklist as part of my executive speech coaching services. But wait. There\u2019s more to the story. As I see it, speechwriting and coaching only comprise part of my purpose. My true purpose came into sharper focus when I made a promise to my mother on her deathbed that I would finish writing a book she had been encouraging me to write, and dedicate it to her memory. She looked up at me with tears in her eyes and said: &#8216;You do that, Matthew. You do that. This makes me very happy.&#8217; I\u2019m proud to say I kept that promise.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019ll be perfectly honest. Keeping that promise was not easy. You see, the book I promised to write was a self-help book and at that time I did not consider myself to be a self-help author. This was outside my comfort zone. But the idea for the book was intriguing enough to me that I discussed it frequently with others, including my mother. And she reminded me of the idea from time-to-time. She seemed to know something that I didn\u2019t fully appreciate: that I should be a personal empowerment author and speaker. I\u2019m convinced now that she had a clearer vision of my purpose years before I perceived it myself.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Making that promise put me on my current path as a personal empowerment author, speaker, workshop leader, and coach. It also helped to shape my overriding mission: to help millions of people around the world replace negative, disempowering habits of thought with positive, empowering mindsets.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Cossolotto recently conducted a series of four PodiumPower! public speaking workshops in Brussels, Belgium, for a major international organization. He also gave two well-received presentations about \u201cThe Joy of Public Speaking\u201d and provided one-on-one speech coaching for two senior executives. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These are the kinds of opportunities I\u2019m looking for,&#8221; explained Cossolotto. &#8220;Workshops, keynotes, and coaching. Ideally, I\u2019ll be able to partner with private and public sector organizations here in the greater Cleveland, Ohio, area, but also in other parts in the United States, in Europe, and beyond.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Distributing his new speaker one sheet &#8212; which is embedded in this release &#8212; is part of Cossolotto&#8217;s ongoing campaign to promote his speaking and coaching programs. Last year, Cossolotto launched a new website (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.MatthewCossolotto.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.MatthewCossolotto.com<\/a>), complete with a demo video and a detailed overview of his Personal Empowerment Programs (PEPTalks) and book projects.

I ask readers and audiences to join me as I unveil what I call &#8216;the gentle art of mental joyjitsu&#8217; \u2013 powerful mindset shifts that encourage participants to turn stage fright into stage delight. My ideas are designed to give your career, your leadership skills, and your self-confidence a big boost.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Joy of Public Speaking is the first book in Cossolotto&#8217;s personal empowerment trilogy. Two additional books are coming soon: Harness Your HabitForce \u2013 which highlights the seven habits of FAILURE and SUCCESS \u2013 and Embrace Your Promise Power \u2013 featuring an extensive foreword by Jack Canfield, co-creator of the Chicken Soup for the Soul<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> series.<\/p>\n<p>As a guest speaker, workshop leader, and executive speech coach, Cossolotto has shared his public speaking and other personal empowerment ideas with a wide range of domestic and international audiences, including corporations, associations, government agencies, conferences, schools, community groups, and nonprofits\/NGOs.<\/p>\n<p>To explore booking Matthew Cossolotto as a guest speaker, workshop leader, or speech coach, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.MatthewCossolotto.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.MatthewCossolotto.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Matthew Cossolotto<br \/>The Podium Pro<br \/>+ +1 4405979018<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/705069641\/mailto:Matthew@MatthewCossolotto.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Matthew@MatthewCossolotto.com<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/powerofapromise\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/matthew-cossolotto-the-podium-pro\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.MatthewCossolotto.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Other<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=FVQwD0jqTECsmN76&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      April 19, 2024, 22:16 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/705069641\/bold-journey-magazine-interviews-matthew-cossolotto-speaker-speech-coach-and-author-of-the-joy-of-public-speaking\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
