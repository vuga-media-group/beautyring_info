After the fundraise, Kasa has the strongest balance sheet in the industry which allows Kasa to go on offense to grow its property portfolio meaningfully without the need for further external funding.<\/p>\n<p><b>Technology-Powered Hospitality<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Kasa has built a truly differentiated proprietary hospitality operating system that materially improves profits for owners and enhances the experience for today&#8217;s modern travelers across a diverse range of investor-owned accommodations, including multifamily apartments, single-family homes and boutique hotels. Kasa consistently improves property profitability by &gt;50% and uplevels property review scores meaningfully across a wide range of channels. Kasa operates the number one rated properties in their category on Tripadvisor in <span class=\"xn-location\">Seattle<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Chicago<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Denver<\/span>, and <span class=\"xn-location\">Austin<\/span>, as well as top-5 properties in <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Pittsburgh<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><b>Strategic Partnerships Catalyze Growth<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Kasa&#8217;s success in increasing profitability after taking over properties has attracted interest from a consortium of real estate investors.

Owners are grappling with rising costs, while consumers crave a seamless, digital-first travel experience in desired locations. Kasa is bridging this gap, revolutionizing the way owners and guests alike think about accommodations. Our model isn&#8217;t just an alternative; it&#8217;s the future&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Roman Pedan<\/span>, Founder &amp; CEO of Kasa.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Trusted by the Most Discerning Real Estate Investors<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Kasa has earned the trust of some of the world&#8217;s most discerning real estate owners, including global stalwarts like Greystar, AMLI Residential, and Starwood Capital and local hospitality investors and developers in cities like <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">New York<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Miami<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Nashville<\/span>, further solidifying its position as the industry standard for alternative accommodations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The consumer trends behind furnished apartment rentals are very strong.
