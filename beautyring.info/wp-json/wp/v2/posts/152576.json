The event will kick off at 11am with an Adoption &amp; Pet Welfare Spotlight at 11:30am, and the screening starting at noon. The event is free admission. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/gracie-pedro-exclusive-advanced-screening-event-tickets-903384065057?aff=oddtdtcreator\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">RSVP to Movie Screening and Dog Adoption here.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur live event was created with a simple goal in mind &#8211; to help families laugh and connect,\u201d Producer Amy Taylor says.
