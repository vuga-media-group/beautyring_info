By presenting these situations in a relatable and understandable manner, the book helps children develop a healthy relationship with money.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Tornabene&#8217;s book is backed by research and expert input. She collaborated with financial educators and child psychologists to ensure that the content is not only accurate but also age-appropriate and engaging. &#8220;It&#8217;s important that the lessons are not only informative but also enjoyable for children,&#8221; Tornabene explains.<\/p>\n<p>The Impact<\/p>\n<p>The potential impact of &#8220;Baxter Learns to Save&#8221; is immense.
