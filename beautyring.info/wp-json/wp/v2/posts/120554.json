Summerfest is a 2-day music event, first conceived by the Board of Directors to create a high caliber outdoor concert experience in Ventura and Los Angeles Counties, and accessible to Southern California residents and tourists.  <\/p>\n<p>Artistic and Music Director Michael Christie has curated an exciting, family-friendly weekend of multi-genre entertainment ranging from classic rock, country, and jazz, culminating with a screening of the 1981 original Raiders of the Lost Ark film, performed live by the full orchestra.  \u201cThe vision driving Summerfest is creating exceptional music experiences in a fun, festival format that welcomes our community and amplifies the power of music in people\u2019s lives,\u201d says Artistic and Music Director Michael Christie. \t<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Julius Sokenu, President of Moorpark College says, \u201cWe are thrilled to be hosting the New West Symphony\u2019s Summerfest at Moorpark College. This is an incredible opportunity for us to showcase the exemplary musicians in our community.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Headlining the Saturday, June 24th line-up is one of classic rock\u2019s biggest stars, Jason Scheff, with Chicago Nights. The music of Chicago is synonymous with legendary and iconic, hearkening to one of the greatest contemporary music periods for originality in songwriting and bands. <\/p>\n<p>In a class by itself, Chicago is a combination of classical music, jazz, R &amp; B, and pop music.  Jason and his show Chicago Nights performing with New West Symphony\u2019s 50 piece-orchestra takes this concept to that ultimate level. Jason Scheff stepped into Chicago with the mega-hit \u201cWill You Still Love Me\u201d in 1986 and became the longest vocalist\/bassist in the band\u2019s history. He composed several original hit songs and will perform many of these with New West Symphony and his band, including drummer Steve Ferrone (Eric Clapton, Bee Gees, Duran Duran, George Harrison, Peter Frampton), guitarist Errol Cooney (Janet Jackson, Stevie Wonder, James Taylor, Christina Aguilera), and keyboardist Brandon Coleman (Babyface, Alicia Keyes, Kamasi Washington, Flying Lotus).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a resident of Moorpark, I am honored as a member of the community to be part of building the future for this significant venue and annual music festival. I couldn\u2019t be more excited to bring the hits I\u2019ve created with Chicago such as \u201cWill You Still Love Me,\u201d What Kind of Man Would I Be,\u201d \u201cLook Away,\u201d as well as all the classics before me; \u201cIf You Leave Me Now\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019re the Inspiration,\u201d \u201cHard To Say I\u2019m Sorry,\u201d and many more. It promises to be an incredible night,\u201d says Jason Scheff. Among his many accolades, he will be inducted into the California Music Hall of Fame in September 2023. <\/p>\n<p>Blurring the lines between Country and hip-hop music, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.blancobrown.com\/welcome\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Blanco Brown<\/a> will make a debut in the Los Angeles area with his southern sound that he proudly calls &#8220;TrailerTrap.&#8221; It&#8217;s a boundary-breaking, multicolored genre of his very own &#8211; which draws upon the rawness and storytelling abilities of his two biggest musical influences, Johnny Cash and Outkast. The world got its first taste of this exciting fusion with the worldwide PLATINUM-certified hit (3X US, 4X Canada, 4X Australia) \u201cThe Git Up.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>On Sunday, June 25 New West Symphony will perform live to the original 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark. With music composed by the prolific John Williams, it received an Academy<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>Award nomination for Best Original Score, and won 5 others. It was the highest-grossing film of 1981, and launched a franchise that will be completed with the upcoming theatrical release Indiana Jones and the  Dial of Destiny in June 2023.<\/p>\n<p>Summerfest 2023 will also feature some of the best food provided by local vendors, from BBQ to vegetarian gluten-free options to carnival style favorites.
