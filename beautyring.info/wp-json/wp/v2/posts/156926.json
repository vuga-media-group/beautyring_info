K. Yamashiro tells the story of a multiracial teenage girl, Anela Lee, whose older brother, Jake, dies on the football field. Yet it is a tale told through a lens of hope and love.<\/p>\n<p>Anela\u2019s shattered parents never wanted her, and without her biggest cheerleader, she withdraws into her pain and insecurities. Even school, once a refuge, means nothing anymore. <\/p>\n<p>Only one teacher, Miss DeGracia, refuses to give up on her, pushing her to enter an essay contest that gives her a shot at Harvard. Still, self-doubt holds Anela back.<\/p>\n<p>Then a senator, Nastasia Yen Strasberg, teaches her about the many world leaders who have used their childhood trauma to do great things. The hope that Anela can turn her pain into something beautiful gives her back her spark and encourages her to enter the contest. But does she have the confidence to share her essay in front of an audience?<\/p>\n<p>ANELA\u2019S CLUB, which has been endorsed by educators, coaches, and authors, appeals to students, teachers, parents, underrepresented teens, or any fan of comeback stories.<\/p>\n<p>The book was recently honored by American Bookfest as a Finalist for Best New Fiction and a Finalist for Young Adult Fiction.<\/p>\n<p>The story is a fitting one for the author to write.  As a teen, Yamashiro faced personal adversity, surviving a 400-foot fall from a ridge in Hawaii and suffering severe brain injuries. A recovery fueling years of research includes a PhD focused on childhood traumas of American presidents. <\/p>\n<p>The book has received high acclaim:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Thought-provoking and timeless . . . offering touch points for diverse audiences, particularly youth navigating the complex terrain of tragedy, abandonment, and self-doubt.&#8221; \u2013Hugh H.
