But for the 805,000 Americans who suffer one every year, a prompt diagnosis should be the highest priority, according to cardiologist <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/team\/robert-segal-md\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Dr. Robert Segal<\/a>, the founder of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Manhattan Cardiology<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Someone in the United States has a heart attack every 40 seconds, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Astoundingly, about 1 in 5 of the cardiac events are silent, meaning the person isn\u2019t aware of any symptoms. But all cases of heart attack\u2014known formally as myocardial infarction\u2014occur when blood flow to the heart is reduced or blocked. This can happen when cholesterol deposits called plaque build up or rupture, forming a clot.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSome people disregard less-severe heart attack symptoms, thinking they have indigestion or another minor ailment instead,\u201d says Dr. Segal, a fellow of the American College of Cardiology whose research has been published in many respected medical journals. \u201cOthers experience warning signs days or weeks before the actual heart attack, such as fleeting chest pain called angina.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But ignoring any heart attack symptoms\u2014which can also include discomfort that spreads to the shoulder, arm, back, neck or jaw\u2014comes at a steep price: About 12% of those who have a heart attack will die from it, according to the CDC. \u201cThere\u2019s good news in that statistic, however,\u201d Dr. Segal points out. \u201cIt means the vast majority of will live\u2014and the odds of a happy ending only increase with immediate medical attention.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What does diagnosis involve?  <\/p>\n<p>Someone who suspects they\u2019re having a heart attack should never attempt to drive themselves to an emergency room, Dr. Segal emphasizes. \u201cImmediately call 911 or have someone drive you to the hospital,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Once there, doctors typically perform various tests to determine how well the heart is beating and confirm if a heart attack has occurred. These diagnostic tests include:<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7\tBlood tests that check for heart proteins that seep into the blood\u2014called cardiac markers\u2014after a heart attack.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tEKG\/ECG (electrocardiogram) to record electrical signals in the heart, with waves displayed on a monitor or a strip of printed paper.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tEchocardiogram to create images of how blood is moving through the heart and valves using ultrasound.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tHeart Monitor to detect arrhythmia or atrial fibrillation (AF)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tChest X-ray to reveal the size and condition of the heart and lungs.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tCardiac catheterization (angiogram) to reveal coronary artery blockages using dye that flows through a long, thin tube inserted into an artery.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tComputed tomography angiography (CTA) to create images of the heart and determine blockages.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe technology doctors have now to diagnose heart attacks and other cardiovascular conditions is breathtaking,\u201d Dr. Segal says. \u201cThat\u2019s another strong reason to seek rapid care. The quicker someone gets diagnosed, the quicker treatment can begin to restore proper blood flow to the heart.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Heart health tips  <\/p>\n<p>Heart attack treatment is highly individualized, depending on the cause and severity of a person\u2019s attack. It can include medication, surgery and other procedures to break up blood clots, reduce stress on the heart, and improve overall blood flow.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut the ideal, of course, is to prevent a heart attack from happening in the first place,\u201d Dr. Segal says. To avoid a heart attack, he offers these heart health tips.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7\tExercise: Whether it\u2019s walking, cycling, swimming or other brisk movement, people should aim to exercise an average of 30 minutes, 5 days a week. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s already had cardiovascular problems should ask their doctor for personalized exercise guidance,\u201d he suggests.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tAim for heart-healthy foods: Limit choices with a lot of saturated fat\u2014such as red meat\u2014as well as processed carbohydrates and sugars. Instead, opt for whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins such as chicken, fish and beans.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tStrive for weight control: \u201cExercise and smart eating patterns go a long way toward controlling weight, lowering the chances of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes,\u201d Dr. Segal says.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tDon\u2019t smoke: Smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States and a huge risk factor for heart attack, he says.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tGet regular checkups: A doctor can keep tabs on important risk factors for heart attack, including cholesterol, blood pressure, and sugar levels, at annual physicals.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMost heart attacks are preventable with commonsense, heart-healthy lifestyle measures,\u201d Dr. Segal says. \u201cNo one wants to suffer a heart attack, but smart, strategic tactics can avert that life-threatening scenario and lead to a longer, more vigorous life.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Manhattan Cardiology is the premier facility for preventive cardiology treatment in New York.
