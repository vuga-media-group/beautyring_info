These internet services include Wi-Fi, mobile (3G, 4G, and LTE), and fixed broadband. Cisco Systems, Inc. predicts that by 2023, nearly two-thirds of the world&#8217;s population will have Internet access. As internet services become more prevalent, the demand for internet bandwidth has increased. Expanding cloud-based applications, soaring demand for audio-video streaming, and Video-on-Demand (VoD) services contribute to this demand.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the regulated demand for mobile data and the anticipated arrival of 5G services, telecom service providers are compelled to purchase the existing dark fiber and focus on developing their fiber network.

Governments of developing nations also support and finance the expansion of the fiber infrastructure market.<\/p>\n<p><b>Growth Opportunities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In numerous application scenarios, the user experience is anticipated to improve with 5G technology, including ultra-high definition (UHD) video, smooth video calling, and virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) games. As numerous companies, such as Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., ZTE Corporation, Nokia, and Ericsson, aggressively pursue the implementation of 5G radio access networks, 5G services are on the verge of being implemented globally. Many interconnected fiber paths can facilitate accomplishing these goals. Therefore, businesses must develop a scalable 5G infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Several companies are installing optical fiber to connect many macro and small cells in regions where they plan to upgrade cell sites to 5G in the coming years. Building fiber infrastructure requires a substantial up-front investment, so many companies opt to rent dark fibers to reduce costs. The leasing of dark fiber for 5G mobile backhauling is a topic of discussion between mobile operators and providers of fiber optic infrastructure in several countries. In addition, businesses are merging and acquiring one another to build the necessary 5G infrastructure. Consequently, market expansion potential is created.<\/p>\n<p><b>Regional Insights<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Asia-Pacific will command the market, expanding at a CAGR of 11.75% during the forecast period.
