We are thrilled to incorporate all those elements into this new, stunning hotel in the vibrant Embarcadero neighborhood.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>With interiors by the local <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco<\/span> studio of award-winning global design firm\u00a0AvroKO, the renovation design embraces The Jay&#8217;s brutalist exterior from noted architect <span class=\"xn-person\">John Portman<\/span> and introduces the concept of warm brutalism. In honoring the building&#8217;s architectural history, the concept of warm\u00a0brutalism blurs the lines between design modalities while providing subtle nods to the local artists and creators who served as inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>While the concrete exterior of the building remains, everything from the porte cochere to the penthouse was reimagined to create a modern and welcoming environment. Guestrooms offer angled floor-to-ceiling windows, drawing in natural light and giving guests views of the <span class=\"xn-location\">Bay<\/span>, Coit Tower and the downtown skyline. Featuring warm wall coverings, soft furnishings and clean lines, guestrooms offer space for rest, relaxation and work. The design blends brutalist shapes with a tone-on-tone palette reflecting calm in both color and shape. Warm oak wood screens with bronze mirror detailing; custom closet doors inspired by the building&#8217;s facade; a stone and walnut console that combines the desk, dresser and mini fridge; custom lighting; and soft custom carpets bring refined and comfortable feel to the rooms. As guests explore <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco<\/span>, they will recognize touches woven throughout the hotel&#8217;s design that were inspired by the sights, sounds and people of the city.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to be a part of this exciting new lifestyle hotel right in our backyard,&#8221; says Greg\u00a0Bradshaw, co-founder and principal of AvroKO. &#8220;We&#8217;ve envisioned The Jay to feel like a &#8216;friend in the know&#8217; \u2013 someplace friendly and warm, but also sophisticated and well crafted. By bringing a layer of warm woods, textured stones, and plasters we were able to honor the building&#8217;s original Brutalist structure while giving it a new life and energy that we believe <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco&#8217;s<\/span> next chapter can be. We really think this is one of the best hotels in all of SF.<i>&#8220;<\/i>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Small and large touches throughout the hotel connect back to <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco<\/span>, from wall coverings inspired by <span class=\"xn-person\">Ruth Asawa&#8217;s<\/span> iconic notebook to artist <span class=\"xn-person\">Peggy Caserta&#8217;s<\/span> unique blend of patterns and textures. A three-story circular staircase, featuring bronze castwork by artist <span class=\"xn-person\">Arnaldo Pomodoro<\/span> and sculptural wood screens, leads to the hotel&#8217;s lobby, The Third Floor Restaurant &amp; Lounge, and the rooftop terrace bar.\u00a0 The staircase was inspired by one designed by <span class=\"xn-person\">John Portman<\/span> for his own home.<\/p>\n<p>The Third Floor Restaurant &amp; Lounge is a modern update to the timeless experience of the hotel lobby restaurant and bar. This upscale, light-filled environment offers a comfortable lounge serving three meals a day, cocktails and a modern spin on traditional afternoon tea. Featuring seasonal menus that reflect the bounty of <span class=\"xn-location\">California<\/span>, Executive Chef Michael\u00a0Magallenes is creating a new downtown dining destination.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It is fitting that our first hotel partnership is with a property that is a love letter to <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco<\/span>,&#8221; said\u00a0Omakase Restaurant Group CEO and co-founder <span class=\"xn-person\">Kash Feng<\/span>. &#8220;This city has brought me so much opportunity to share the foods and flavors that inspire me and we are so excited to now share with even more guests at The Jay.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Third Floor features progressive <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco<\/span> cuisine &#8211; a <span class=\"xn-location\">California<\/span> slant on Asian flavors such as duck\u00a0wonton soup, a selection of yakitori, Korean fried cauliflower and locally-sourced seafood towers. The Third Floor also introduces a fresh take on traditional afternoon tea service, offering local <span class=\"xn-person\">Red Blossom Teas<\/span> with sweet and savory selections that include raw oysters served with apple mignonette and champagne espuma and persimmon cream puffs.<\/p>\n<p>The Jay has 13,000 square feet of meeting space across 16 distinct meeting areas on two floors. Each meeting room&#8217;s unique modern design tells a story that aligns with the <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco<\/span> legend for which the rooms are named. The Jay&#8217;s meeting facilities offer the highest quality meeting amenities and world-class banquet capabilities, with customizable menus featuring local ingredients and to feed the body and soul.<\/p>\n<p><b>About The Jay Hotel<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b><u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4035818-1&amp;h=2284422232&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thejaysanfrancisco.com%2F&amp;a=The+Jay+Hotel\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">The Jay Hotel<\/a><\/u>\u00a0is a newly renovated luxury hotel located in the heart of <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco&#8217;s<\/span> vibrant and historic Embarcadero neighborhood.
