This is mainly because dry pumps are used for a wide range of processes such as distillation, evaporation, drying, crystallization, and many more to pump out the gases. Moreover, the dry pumps can reduce heat load, consume less power, and need less water and oil which are the major factors expected to amplify the growth of the market sub-segment over the analysis timeframe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Pressure: Medium Vacuum Pumps Sub-Segment to be Most Lucrative<\/b>\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The medium vacuum pumps sub-segment held the highest market share in 2021. The increasing demand for medium vacuum pumps across industries due to their numerous advantages such as greater pumping speed, wide operating pressure range, better performance at high pressures, and many more is expected to augment the growth of the vacuum pumps market sub-segment over the estimated period.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>End-User: Chemical &amp; Petrochemical Sub-Segment to be Most Productive\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The chemical &amp; petrochemical sub-segment generated the biggest market share in 2021. The increasing demand for vacuum pumps in chemical and petrochemical operations for a wide range of tasks such as filtration, distillation, evaporation, crystallization, degassing, and many more are expected to propel the growth of the market sub-segment during the forecast period.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Region: Asia-Pacific <\/b><b>Market<\/b><b> Expected to Have Wide Growth Opportunities\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The Asia-Pacific region of the vacuum pumps market is expected to hold the maximum market share during the analysis period. This is mainly due to the increasing demand for vacuum pumps among various industries including chemical, semiconductor, and healthcare. Moreover, the increasing need for vacuum pumps in the chemical industry of the region to handle caustic and toxic substances is expected to drive the regional growth of the market over the estimated period.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=ypAdzOMZc07QdRwvpOA0XX3IDGRUf_-jHCAuUH05vhZIuDNzLVy1kzjMDMVBgOxOjfUAluJqk9pnPxhucsNlW8MfSwAvZPlZNwYicVYAUCNsO0OB86zCkYRFKANWHUg-10h5zWlygpv_lF8sttpoDKgFgRdqPWfRqJX4WF9BebR_H_mmEfjsZXAb6A4oR2W2jTvcM6VSgPXm8cgtzNPznTHx02kVvTqyf95ykfrpC3Q=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>Ask an Expert Analyst or Schedule a call to Get the Latest Trends on Vacuum Pumps Market<\/b><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Covid-19 Impact on the Vacuum Pumps Market\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has brought numerous uncertainties across various industries. It has also negatively impacted the growth of the vacuum pumps market. This is mainly due to the closure of manufacturing units, and reduced demand from end-use industries such as automotive, aerospace &amp; defense, oil &amp; gas, and others. Moreover, the shortage of physical workforce due to social distancing guidelines and import-export restrictions have badly impacted the vacuum pumping operations during the pandemic period.
