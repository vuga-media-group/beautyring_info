I believe my book offers hope and compassion and a new way of understanding and thinking about FM,\u201d said Dunton, who has lived with fibromyalgia for nearly three decades.<\/p>\n<p>Her story begins in the summer of 1996 when, as a recent college grad brimming with energy, she was suddenly struck with a sharp, piercing pain beneath her shoulder, marking the start of her journey into the unknown world of fibromyalgia. <\/p>\n<p>Readers witness in vivid detail Dunton\u2019s physical, social, mental and emotional pain, as she struggles to navigate a medical system that often doubts the \u201crealness\u201d of her condition. In one particularly traumatic incident, a medical mishap during a steroid injection further complicates her health. <\/p>\n<p>Dunton\u2019s well-rounded approach leaves no stone unturned, as she intertwines life\u2019s experiences, both positive and negative, with her fibromyalgia journey. The impact of past trauma on physical and mental health is thoughtfully examined, offering insights into the connections between emotional well-being and chronic illness. <\/p>\n<p>Along the way, she faces financial struggles and must apply for disability benefits \u2014 an emotional rollercoaster that culminates in a nerve-wracking day in court. <\/p>\n<p>Weaving heartfelt introspection with plenty of research, Dunton shares valuable lessons she has learned, the challenges she has faced and the resilience she has cultivated over decades. Ultimately, she hopes to foster a collective sense of empowerment and understanding as she welcomes readers to embark on a shared journey characterized by unwavering support and limitless optimism for the future.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhether you\u2019ve recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and just beginning your journey with this condition, or you&#8217;ve been living with it for years, my book can help you find the strength, hope, courage and resilience you need to keep moving forward,\u201d Dunton added.<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<br \/>Jenny Dunton believes in the power of sharing experiences to promote healing, to inspire and to bring hope to those who need it most.
