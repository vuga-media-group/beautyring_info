The legislation, initially introduced by Senator Jon Kyl, underwent intense negotiations and ultimately garnered bipartisan support from an overwhelming majority in Congress. The authors delve into the painstaking two-decade process that led to the eventual implementation of this groundbreaking decision.<\/p>\n<p>The title of the book takes inspiration from the writings, interviews, and speeches of Senator Kyl, who graciously contributed the foreword. When asked about the significance of passing a law recognizing an undivided Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocating the embassy, Senator Kyl emphasized the principles of justice and righteousness. This theme resonated with other key figures involved in this historic undertaking, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, resulting in the passage of the Jerusalem Embassy Act on a bipartisan basis with an overwhelming majority vote. Grunstein and Weiss eloquently explain the historical, legal, and moral rationale behind recognizing Jerusalem as Israel&#8217;s capital, debunking prevalent misconceptions and presenting a compelling case that it was a just and right decision.<\/p>\n<p>By skillfully weaving together biblical references, Jewish history, international and US law, as well as legal precedents, Grunstein and Weiss breathe life into their exploration of the subject matter. The book enlightens readers with an in-depth understanding of the complexities surrounding Jerusalem and Israel, offering both an enlightening and entertaining journey.<\/p>\n<p>The authors shed light on the bipartisan efforts of Senators Bob Dole, Pat Moynihan, and Jon Kyl, who tirelessly championed the cause of recognizing Jerusalem as Israel&#8217;s capital and facilitated the embassy&#8217;s relocation. Grunstein and Weiss meticulously navigate the legal, political, and social challenges encountered on this path toward a &#8220;right and just&#8221; outcome.<\/p>\n<p>In a testimonial that resonates with readers, Governor Mike Huckabee describes the promises made by both Democratic and Republican Presidents to acknowledge Jerusalem as the legitimate capital of Israel and the Jewish people. However, it was under President Trump&#8217;s administration that these pledges were fulfilled, culminating in the long-awaited relocation of the embassy. Huckabee recounts his personal conversation with the President, where he expressed the conviction that moving the embassy was the morally and politically correct action.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Because It&#8217;s Just and Right&#8221; offers a unique and comprehensive overview of the political and legal landscape that led to the United States&#8217; recognition of Jerusalem as Israel&#8217;s capital and the subsequent relocation of the US embassy. This meticulously crafted book is an indispensable resource for anyone seeking a profound understanding of the historical significance of this event and its enduring impact on US-Israel relations.<\/p>\n<p>David Friedman, former US Ambassador to Israel, lauds the book as essential reading for obtaining a comprehensive understanding of why Jerusalem is, and should always remain, the undivided and eternal capital of the Jewish State. Senator Joe Lieberman, a key figure in garnering bipartisan support for the Act, praises Farley Weiss and Len Grunstein for their poignant storytelling, highlighting their ability to convey the dramatic narrative of how the United States Congress enacted legislation to relocate the embassy to Jerusalem in 1995 and how this long-awaited promise was finally fulfilled in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>Stuart Force, the father of Taylor Force ob&#8221;m, offers a poignant testimonial, acknowledging the book&#8217;s contribution to comprehending the intricate dynamics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Force underscores the book&#8217;s value as a comprehensive resource that addresses the multifaceted facets of the conflict, recommending its inclusion on every reference shelf dedicated to Israel and the Middle East.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, &#8220;Because It&#8217;s Just and Right&#8221; by Leonard Grunstein and Farley Weiss is a remarkable literary work that unveils the untold narrative behind the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel&#8217;s capital and the embassy relocation.
