The startup Gaia Tech is making use of food byproducts to create top-performing ingredients that align with the industry\u2019s need to respond to growing consumer and regulatory pressure for sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>The cosmetic industry is in a transformative phase<\/p>\n<p>Consumers are placing increasing value on sustainability and naturalness. The regulatory requirements for ingredients in industrial products are also tightening. The cosmetics industry is increasingly looking for so-called &#8220;clean label ingredients&#8221; \u2013 additives that are not only effective, but also environmentally friendly and harmless to the body. This development is part of a wider trend towards greater transparency and responsibility towards the environment and consumers. However, the startup Gaia Tech\u2019s emerges from a very different background.<\/p>\n<p>A startup pioneering a circular extraction process<\/p>\n<p>Peels, pulp, pomace, pits, shells, hulls, skins, seeds and other food byproducts are often a burden for producers and need to be disposed of at a cost. Gaia Tech\u2019s founder Claudio Reinhard saw with his own eyes how large quantities of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/Mvnm5utc2b0?feature=shared\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">olive oil production residues cause environmental problems<\/a> in Spain. Back at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, he developed a process to extract high-quality antioxidants from the olive pomace. The innovative treatment begins with the separation of the solid and liquid components of the olive pomace. The liquid part is then passed through a specially developed biosorbent material, which absorbs the antioxidants. The absorber is made of a fully biodegradable material and can be used several times before being applied as agricultural fertilizer at the end of its life cycle. In the last step, the antioxidant extract is purified in order to be incorporated into industrial products.<\/p>\n<p>The industry has a strong demand for natural antioxidants<\/p>\n<p>The startup&#8217;s first product, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gaiatech.ch\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">an olive antioxidant extract<\/a>, is currently being tested by leading industrial partners for diverse applications, from anti-aging cosmetics to natural food preservation. A researcher from the cosmetics industry says that Gaia Tech has &#8220;the best antioxidant technology they have tested so far&#8221;. Preparations for market entry are in full swing, analytical trials are being launched in cosmetics, and the startup is also submitting an EFSA dossier for use in food.<\/p>\n<p>Exploring the power of innovative upcycled ingredients<\/p>\n<p>Distributors and manufacturers wanting to start or expand their upcycled portfolio are a great match for the startup. Following a successful spin-off from ETH Zurich, Gaia Tech has closed a first financing round and secured support from the Migros Pioneer Fund, Innosuisse, the Bern Economic Development Agency and the School of Agricultural, Forest and Food Sciences HAFL. The company aims to expand its product range and scale the technology to other types of agrifood byproducts, to fully support the industry in substituting synthetic and fossil ingredients. The team is excited to become a trusted partner in the transformative years ahead and elaborate innovative ingredients from bio-based sources.<\/p>\n<p>For any questions contact us at hello@gaiatech.ch and feel free to access and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=1M2hbUFWbXpICdaqBdVctbHdOQwVNvKQj&amp;usp=drive_fs\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">download further pictures and logos in the media kit folder.<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Samuel B\u00fchlmann<br \/>Gaia Tech AG<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/682444186\/tel:+41 78 714 06 75\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">+41 78 714 06 75<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/682444186\/mailto:sam@gaiatech.ch\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">sam@gaiatech.ch<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/gaiatechxyz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/85823096\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@gaiatechxyz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Gaia Tech&#8217;s Co-Founder Claudio Reinhard about the importance of upcycling agricultural sidestreams into ingredients for cosmetic and food products.<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"R6O4kkdOLOo\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Upcycle agricultural waste for cosmetics and food\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/R6O4kkdOLOo?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=Sbz_hc7647TFYUgD&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      January 23, 2024, 07:15 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/682444186\/advancing-the-cosmetic-industry-with-gaia-tech-s-upcycling-innovation\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
