If you can live with that, I promise it\u2019ll be a fun ride!\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Bryan Brooks<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK, USA, November 16, 2023 \/<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/\" dir=\"auto\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">EINPresswire.com<\/a>\/ &#8212; There\u2019s no doubt, 80s-era throwback films and TV shows have recently gained momentum with audiences.  Need Proof?  Just look at the immense popularity of the television series Stranger Things or the Blockbuster hit film Top Gun: Maverick.  It seems audiences are turning their attention to a nostalgic era, but why?  Perhaps the lack of seriousness in our childhood entertainment is an attraction all on its own.  <\/p>\n<p>Ideas that were popular decades ago have been recreated over and over and updated to fit our changing times, adding earnest tones to make storylines more believable and foregoing the comedy which made these shows popular in the first place.  The original Batman television series (1966-1968) was described by executive producer William Dozier as the only situation comedy on the air without a laugh track.  Just take a look at how serious a man dressed as a bat who fights crime is taken today.  <\/p>\n<p>To step back and watch any of the dozens of popular tv shows and films of the 80s will remind viewers just how no-too-serious the themes of old were.  Shows like the A-team, Magnum P.I. and Buck Rogers were all created as serious action dramas in their time, yet by today\u2019s standards are seen as tongue-and-cheek and ofter referred to as \u201ccheesy\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>So why have audiences foregone comedy in favor of more serious themes?  Well, it appears they haven\u2019t.  Audiences are showing they don\u2019t necessarily want to take everything so serious.  It\u2019s easier and more fun when they don\u2019t have to think so hard about storylines or make sense of all that\u2019s presented to them on the screen.  <\/p>\n<p>While some big budget Hollywood films have adopted the more serious approach with their story telling, some Independent films are sticking with a more fun approach.  Up and coming filmmaker Bryan Brooks favors the more comedic themes when it comes to his productions.  Brooks finished work on his film <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/B0B6GZPQP7\/ref=atv_dp_share_cu_r\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">WRECKER<\/a> (2022) at the end of last year and has watched it gain momentum on Prime Video, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/REUk6Yahe3U?si=SJlI0H0ZLwe7wKfN\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube Movies<\/a> and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/tubitv.com\/movies\/692972\/wrecker\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Tubi<\/a>.  The film took several years to complete as Bryan Brooks, acting as a one-man film studio, completed every step of the filmmaking process by himself.  \u201cI created the movie I always wanted to see.  It&#8217;s got action from start to finish, a great story, interesting characters, romance, adventure, turmoil, horror and zombies\u2026 don\u2019t forget the zombies.  But, I made it as funny as it is thrilling, like the movies I loved as a kid.  It\u2019s not to be taken too seriously.  If you can live with that, I promise it\u2019ll be a fun ride!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The whole concept of creating a film is to garner success through the pleasing of its audience.  Adding comedy to tone down the severity of a storyline helps audiences take a breath and relax into the film, accepting it for what it is, entertainment.  John Landis\u2019 American Werewolf In London established a very clear pattern of joke\/scare, joke\/scare, and audiences absolutely ate up the dichotomy.  That film is still considered one of the greatest horror films ever created.  Bryan Brooks drew heavily from the lessons of Landis\u2019 classic and the 80s nostalgia can be seen in Brooks film Wrecker (2022).  Brooks hopes audiences will continue their interest in retro themes and ideas as he plans to add an 80s mentality in his future projects.
