Jasa, who has starred in national commercials and print ads for major brands like Citibank and Amazon, and played pivotal roles in network hits such as CBS\u2019s &#8220;S.W.A.T.&#8221; and ABC\u2019s &#8220;Castle,&#8221; is set to use her dual state presence to advocate for children&#8217;s mental health. <\/p>\n<p>Raised in California and now representing Nevada, a state significant to her due to her brother\u2019s service at Nellis Air Force Base, Jasa is determined to use her title to make a substantial impact. Her advocacy is deeply personal, rooted in her own childhood experiences of overcoming abuse, violence, and poverty. These challenges have driven her to champion the importance of self-esteem and mental well-being from a young age.<\/p>\n<p>Her commitment to this cause is highlighted by her authorship of &#8220;The Ugly Lobster,&#8221; a children&#8217;s book aimed at nurturing self-esteem which will be released in late August. Jasa will donate copies of her book to classrooms across California and Nevada, and to the non-profit organization, A Place Called Home, which helps disadvantaged youths achieve success.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs Ms. Nevada United States, I have the opportunity to further my advocacy for children\u2019s mental health, a cause that is not only close to my heart but essential for our future,\u201d said Jasa. \u201cI believe that instilling strong self-esteem early in life can profoundly influence a child\u2019s ability to handle life&#8217;s challenges and maintain mental health.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bora Jasa will be a featured storyteller reading &#8220;The Ugly Lobster&#8221; at the Los Angeles Kids Book Festival on September 8, from 9:30 am to 4:30 pm at West Hollywood Park. Additionally, Bora Jasa is also available for appearances and interviews, seeking to leverage media and print exposure to extend the reach of her book and message to a broader community. Her efforts aim to get her empowering literature into more classrooms and homes in California and Nevada.<\/p>\n<p>Jasa is also preparing to compete for the title of Ms. Woman United States in Memphis, Tennessee, in October 2024, where she plans to continue promoting her platform on a national stage.<\/p>\n<p>To contact Bora Jasa for more information, appearances, and interviews, visit her website at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.borajasa.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.borajasa.com\/<\/a> or send an email to MsNevadaUnitedStates@gmail.com.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nadvocate for children&#8217;s mental health.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Rachel Harris<br \/>Pulse Media<br \/>+1 888-888-8888<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/728317859\" data-src=\"ZK5qAQ9tNNrKUoEK\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=8qKc333K51LR5ImU&amp;i=ZK5qAQ9tNNrKUoEK\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      July 17, 2024, 15:20 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/728317859\/bora-jasa-crowned-ms-nevada-united-states-2024-advocating-for-children-s-mental-health\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
