Since its most recent update on its Q4 2023 earnings call, the WAVE booking season has exceeded the company&#8217;s initial expectations, with the first 5 weeks of the year resulting in the best WAVE booking weeks in the company&#8217;s history. Bookings have been significantly higher than during the same period last year, with the back half of the year up by more than the front half. For 2024, all four quarters and all key products are booked ahead of the same time last year in both rate and volume. Consumer spending for onboard purchases continue to exceed prior years driven by greater participation at higher prices, indicating quality and healthy future demand.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Since our last earnings call, robust demand for our vacation experiences has significantly exceeded our initial expectations,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Jason Liberty<\/span>, president and CEO of Royal Caribbean. &#8220;As a result, we are increasing our 2024 guidance on stronger revenue outlook, and we expect to achieve all <b><i>Trifecta<\/i><\/b> goals in 2024. <b><i>Trifecta<\/i><\/b> marks an important milestone as we remain intensely focused on delivering a lifetime of vacations and priceless memories for our guests while delivering exceptional long-term shareholder value.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As a result of the strong WAVE season, the company is increasing its 2024 Adjusted EPS guidance by <span class=\"xn-money\">$0.40<\/span> compared to its February guidance. For the full year, Adjusted EPS is now expected to be <span class=\"xn-money\">$9.90<\/span> to <span class=\"xn-money\">$10.10<\/span> driven by an increase in constant currency net yield growth of approximately 100 bps compared to the February guidance. Approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$0.15<\/span> of the full year increase in adjusted EPS is driven by an improved revenue outlook for the first quarter of 2024. The company now expects to achieve all\u00a0<b><i>Trifecta<\/i><\/b> goals in 2024.<\/p>\n<p><b><u>About Royal Caribbean Group<br class=\"dnr\"><\/u><\/b>Royal Caribbean Group (NYSE: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ticket-symbol\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#financial-modal\">RCL<\/a>) is one of the leading cruise companies in the world with a global fleet of 65 ships traveling to approximately 1,000 destinations around the world.

(as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis.<\/p>\n<p><i>Adjusted Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.<\/i>\u00a0is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income (loss) less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis.<\/p>\n<p><i>Constant Currency<\/i> is a significant measure for our revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, the value of these revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollar will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses, it can be an important element. For this reason, we also monitor our revenues and expenses in &#8220;Constant Currency&#8221; &#8211; i.e., as if the current period&#8217;s currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior period&#8217;s rates. We do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods. It should be emphasized that the use of Constant Currency is primarily used by us for comparing short-term changes and\/or projections. Over the longer term, changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currency-based fluctuations.<\/p>\n<p><i>EBITDA<\/i> is a non-GAAP measure that represents of Net Income (Loss) attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. excluding (i) interest income; (ii) interest expense, net of interest capitalized; (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses; and (iv) income tax expense. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaning when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis.<\/p>\n<p><i>Invested Capital<\/i> represents the most recent five-quarter average of total debt (i.e., Current portion of long-term debt plus Long-term debt) plus the most recent five-quarter average of Total shareholders&#8217; equity. We use this measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below).<\/p>\n<p><i>Return on Invested Capital (&#8220;ROIC&#8221;)<\/i> represents Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) divided by Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business. ROIC is also used as a key metric in our long-term incentive compensation program for our executive officers.<\/p>\n<p><i>Adjusted Gross Margin <\/i>represent Gross Margin, adjusted for payroll and related, food, fuel, other operating, and depreciation and amortization expenses. Gross Margin is calculated pursuant to GAAP as total revenues less total cruise operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization.<\/p>\n<p><i>Net Yields<\/i>\u00a0represent Adjusted Gross Margin per APCD. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin and Net Yields to manage our business on a day-to-day basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs, which are commissions, transportation and other expenses, and onboard and other expenses.<\/p>\n<p><i>Trifecta<\/i>\u00a0refers to the multi-year Adjusted EBITDA per APCD, Adjusted EPS and ROIC goals we publicly announced in <span class=\"xn-chron\">November 2022<\/span> and seeking to achieve by the end of 2025. We designed this program to help us better execute and achieve our business goals by clearly articulating longer-term financial objectives. Under the Trifecta Program, we are targeting Adjusted EBITDA per APCD of at lease <span class=\"xn-money\">$100<\/span>, Adjusted EPS of at least <span class=\"xn-money\">$10<\/span>, and ROIC of 13% or higher by the end of 2025.<\/p>\n<p><b>Adjusted Measures of Financial Performance<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We have not provided in this press release a quantitative reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because preparation of meaningful U.S. GAAP projections would require unreasonable effort. Due to significant uncertainty, we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, the future movement of foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates inclusive of our related hedging programs. In addition, we are unable to determine the future impact of non-core business related gains and losses which may result from strategic initiatives. These items are uncertain and could be material to our results of operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Due to this uncertainty, we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful.<\/p>\n<p>SOURCE Royal Caribbean Group<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt src=\"https:\/\/rt.prnewswire.com\/rt.gif?NewsItemId=FL42252&amp;Transmission_Id=202402211719PR_NEWS_USPR_____FL42252&amp;DateId=20240221\" style=\"border:0px; width:1px; height:1px;\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Originally published at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/royal-caribbean-group-increases-2024-guidance-on-accelerating-demand-302068076.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer sponsored\">https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/royal-caribbean-group-increases-2024-guidance-on-accelerating-demand-302068076.html<\/a><br \/>\n<font size=\"-1\"><em>Images courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/pixabay.com<\/a><\/em><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since last earnings call, demand and bookings have exceeded expectations\u00a0 Adjusted EPS in 2024 is now expected to be $9.90 &#8211; $10.10\u00a0 The company expects to achieve all Trifecta goals in 2024 MIAMI, Feb. 21, 2024 \/PRNewswire\/ &#8212; Royal Caribbean Group (NYSE: RCL) today provided an update on demand and updated its 2024 guidance.
