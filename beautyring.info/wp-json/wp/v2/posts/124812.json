When brain cells are starved of oxygen they begin to die within a matter of minutes. When blood flow to, or within the brain, is blocked or severely disrupted, many brain cells can be deprived of oxygen all at once, causing a <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/conditions\/stroke\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">stroke<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are two main types of stroke. Ischemic strokes are caused by clots that restrict or block the flow of blood. Hemorrhagic strokes are caused by bleeds which can put enormous pressure on the brain,\u201d said <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/team\/robert-segal-md\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Dr. Robert Segal<\/a>, cardiologist, and founder of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Manhattan Cardiology<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe important thing to remember is that minutes and even seconds count during a stroke. Know the signs, and if you or someone you know might be having a stroke, call 911 without delay,\u201d Segal said.<\/p>\n<p>The classical signs of stroke usually come on suddenly, and include:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tNumbness in the face, arm, or leg, and especially on just one side of the body<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tConfusion<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tTrouble speaking or understanding speech<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tDizziness <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tLoss of balance or coordination<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tVision problems such as blurriness or double-vision<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tSevere headache<\/p>\n<p>If someone is suspected of having a stroke, it can be helpful to remember the acronym FAST:<\/p>\n<p>Face: ask them to smile and look for droopiness on one side<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nArms: ask them to raise their arms and see if one can\u2019t stay elevated<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSpeech: ask them to recite their name and address and listen for slurring or unusual speech<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nTime: dial 911 immediately if any of these symptoms were observed<\/p>\n<p>When someone is having a stroke, they should never attempt to drive themselves to the hospital. Additionally, they should not get a ride to the hospital either. Instead, 911 should be called so an ambulance can transport them to the hospital. This way, the paramedics can begin urgent medical interventions on the way, saving precious time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s also something called a transient ischemic attack. It\u2019s sometimes called a TIA, a mini-stroke, or a warning stroke. These are caused by smaller clots that dislodge themselves after a few minutes. These should be treated with the same seriousness and urgency as a stroke with a call to 911 right away,\u201d said Segal.<\/p>\n<p>The symptoms of a TIA and a stroke are identical, and it\u2019s common for people who\u2019ve experienced a TIA to go on to have a stroke in the following months or year. Fast medical intervention could help to prevent a future stroke.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s certainly a benefit to understanding the risk factors of having a stroke. Having an awareness of a family history of stroke for example can keep it more top-of-mind in the event that the symptoms of stroke start presenting. But more than that, some risk factors are behaviors that can be changed to then lower a person\u2019s overall stroke risk profile,\u201d said Segal.<\/p>\n<p>Risk factors of stroke include:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tAge: anyone can have a stroke, but risk goes up in later adulthood<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tSex: women are more likely to have strokes than men<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tRace: African Americans are more likely to have strokes than other racial groups<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tHaving already had a previous stroke or TIA<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tFamily history of stroke<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tSickle cell disease<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tHeart disease or heart disorders<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tDiabetes<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tHigh blood pressure<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tHigh cholesterol<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tSmoking<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tAlcohol consumption<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tObesity<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tPhysical inactivity<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00b7\tDiet high in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, or sodium<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLowering the risk of having a stroke isn\u2019t always easy, but it\u2019s also not complicated. Maintaining a healthy diet and a healthy weight with regular exercise is a great place to start. Avoid smoking and limit alcohol use. Beyond that, it\u2019s encouraged to go to annual checkups and stay on any prescriptive medications to help control blood pressure, cholesterol, or other risk factors,\u201d said Segal.<\/p>\n<p>When someone has a stroke, medical professionals will intervene as soon as possible. Oftentimes medication will be the first approach, but surgeries or other special treatments may be needed as well.<\/p>\n<p>After someone has had a stroke, they\u2019re at greater risk for another.<\/p>\n<p>Because at least some brain cells were likely destroyed or damaged, rehabilitation is frequently needed. Rehabilitation will usually start within the first days after having a stroke. Depending on the severity of the stroke and how rapidly medical attention was administered, rehabilitation could continue for weeks to years, and a complete recovery is achieved only some of the time.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter someone has had a stroke, they can expect not only specialized interventions such as occupational therapy, but also medications to prevent future strokes as well as treatments for emotional effects such as depression. Having a stroke is a major challenge in someone\u2019s life. My advice would be to do what you can to prevent it, and don\u2019t wait even a minute to call 911 if someone might be having a stroke,\u201d said Segal.<\/p>\n<p>Manhattan Cardiology is the premier facility for preventive cardiology in New York.
