This exciting partnership will provide Bosco students with invaluable educational resources and one-on-one mentorship opportunities from some of the top engineers, technologists and executives working in the media and entertainment industry. As a result, students will gain access to a wealth of job and internship opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Not only is SMPTE an internationally recognized standards organization which has published hundreds of technical standards and related documents for broadcast, filmmaking, digital cinema and more, but they\u2019re also highly involved in educational and professional development activities within the industry. They sponsor many awards and have a number of student chapters and scholarships for college students in the motion imaging disciplines. <\/p>\n<p>As part of the partnership, Bosco students will benefit from:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Educational Resources: Access to SMPTE&#8217;s extensive library of educational materials, workshops, and seminars, ensuring that students are at the forefront of industry knowledge.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 One-On-One Mentorships: Bosco students will have the unique opportunity to be mentored by experienced professionals from SMPTE, providing invaluable guidance and insights as they pursue college and their careers.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 Job and Internship Opportunities: SMPTE&#8217;s vast network within the film and media industry will open doors for Bosco students, allowing them to secure internships and job placements that align with their college and career aspirations.<\/p>\n<p>Renard T. Jenkins, President of SMPTE, is excited about partnering with the next generation of young filmmakers. He said, \u201cI am thrilled that our Society is able to join forces with St. John Bosco High School to support these types of opportunities for students in the Los Angeles area and around the globe. Our Society has over 6K+ members worldwide and that equates to over 100K+ years of experience and wisdom across the diverse landscape of film, television, animation and content creation science and technology. We want to share that knowledge with the next generation of filmmakers because this is how we prepare the talent pipeline for the future of our industry.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>St. John Bosco High School\u2019s Film and Media Arts Pathway is a professional industry preparation program designed to prepare students for collegiate film school. On the heels of their partnership with For A Bright Future Foundation, which brought a brand new media lab to their campus, and their subsequent plans to launch their own streaming network, Bosco+, St. John Bosco High School announced last month that they have also established an affiliate partnership with NFHS Network, the leader in high school sports broadcasting. The school will not only be producing content for their own platform but will also be producing live sporting events for NFHS Network \u2013 all powered by students from their Film &amp; Media Arts Pathway program. The school\u2019s partnership with SMPTE will help provide vital resources and learning opportunities to the pathway students who are helping pave the way for the future of high school media. <\/p>\n<p>Kennith Flaherty, Film &amp; Media Arts Pathway Instructor at Bosco, is excited to keep building out the pathway which was started just four years ago and will see its first graduating class this May. \u201cTo be able to offer our students the resources, mentorship, job and internship opportunities that this partnership will provide is an incredible step forward for our program and for our students who will be going on to study film and media at the next level as they prepare for a career in the dynamic and ever\u00ac-evolving  media industry. We\u2019re absolutely thrilled to be collaborating with SMPTE and can\u2019t wait to get started,\u201d he said.  <\/p>\n<p>Derrick Fernando, Assistant Principal of Academic Affairs at Bosco added, \u201cIt\u2019s our job to do everything in our power to provide our students with learning opportunities that will help propel them toward their dreams. We\u2019re incredibly excited to be partnering with some of the brightest minds in the film and media business to offer our students the resources to do just that.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>About St. John Bosco High School<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSt. John Bosco High School (SJB) is a premier all-boys college preparatory school founded in 1940 and located in Bellflower, California.
