Physical therapists were searching for a device that would allow patients to mechanically bend their own knees so that they could be guided by their own pain and thus fully engage and be in control of their own recovery,&#8221; Dr. Craig A. Schultz, Physical Therapist, Orem Utah<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Schultz continues: &#8220;GenuEase is that device. GenuEase provides patients: (1) faster range-of-motion ROM recovery, (2) with fewer complications and (3) greater satisfaction than any other rehabilitation method. GenuEase is protected by two US patents and has been proven by thousands of patients in millions of therapy cycles.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Doctors Love GenuEase. When surgeons notice the improved recovery rates and flexibility of patients using GenuEase they become a partner of choice as prescribed rehabilitation services. Physical Therapists investment in a GenuEase can represent a real competitive advantage and opportunity for increased market share over clinics offering only traditional knee rehabilitation services.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Why It Works: Patients recover a greater range of motion (ROM) in less time for several reasons. GenuEase provides better isolation of the knee and more targeted rehabilitation than is possible with manual stretching, wall slides, or other traditional treatments. GenuEase supports a greater range of dynamic motion than any other method provides.<\/p>\n<p>However, the most important reason why GenuEase delivers faster recovery, and better results, is the complete elimination of patient apprehension and muscle guarding.<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: GenUbender is the lighter weight, made for home use, more portable version of the GenuEase<\/p>\n<p>How To Use a GenuEase: ( Education on Usage )<\/p>\n<p>Step 1: Before helping a patient on the machine, slide the leg support arms to the right or left depending on the knee being treated. After appropriate warm up, have the patient sit on the padded seat with their legs supported but hanging freely \u2013 about two inches from the front edge of the seat to their popliteal space. This is how the patient secures the safety-strap on the leg GenuEase workout machine.<\/p>\n<p>Step 2: Raise the leg-support-arms to a comfortable angle and then slide the leg support to the Achilles-Tendon position on the lower leg, and secure with the padded Velcro-strap. To achieve total knee isolation, firmly fasten the thigh strap, and then connect the seat belt snugly across the patient\u2019s lap. No more hip hiking is experienced. Now snap in the handle attachment, release the tensioning knob on the leg support arms \u2013 and the patient is ready to engage the GenuEase device.<\/p>\n<p>Step 3: Touch \u2018New Patient\u2019 in order to enter the patient\u2019s name, or select the patient\u2019s name from the already existing list on the GenuEase device. Physical Therapists may enter flexion and extension goals for the patient which show up as yellow lines on the screen. Doctors can also adjust the \u2018hold time\u2019 they will use during therapy; as the default is 30-seconds. Physicians can then touch \u2018Start Session\u2019 which will prompt the administrator or patient to \u2018set the timer\u2019 for the session; the default time is 15 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Step 4: Patients begin rotating the cranking GenuEase mechanism which smoothly flexes or extends the leg depending on the direction it is turned. The patient then follows specific rehabilitation session protocols. A typical session would include 20 to 30 minutes of flexing and extending the leg to the patient\u2019s pain limit at each end of their range of motion. Patients\u2019 start gradually and increase intensity as the joint limbers. The patient is encouraged to hold the stretch for 30 seconds at both ends of the flexion and extension cycle.<\/p>\n<p>THERAPIST TESTIMONIAL:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cI have had an overwhelming response from patients about the effectiveness of GenuEase. Patients have returned to my clinic because we are the only facility that has the GenuEase. As a physical therapist I value the GenuEase because the patient is always in control which drastically reduces muscle guarding. The GenuEase is also a great way to build patient confidence because the patient receives immediate feedback on range of motion progress.\u201d<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2014Tom Farnsworth P.T., M.P.T .<\/p>\n<p>THERAPIST TESTIMONIAL:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cI thought all my post-op. knee patients (especially total knees) needed was my hands-on mobilization for ROM. I was wrong. I have found GenuEase is a critical adjunct to my manual stretching. My patients, particularly the more difficult and guarded cases, gain greater ROM in less time using GenuEase.\u201d<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2014Darren Averett, DPT<\/p>\n<p>Case Studies:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nGenuEase is capable of -5\u00b0 to 135\u00b0 Range of Motion (ROM). A digital display provides the patient with a real time measure of their ROM as well as their progress across sessions. This critical information provides the intrinsic motivation which influences your patient\u2019s effort during each session. Recording and tracking session data allows the patient not only to set goals but also to recognize both their improvement over time and the value of services provided.<\/p>\n<p>Patients Start Recovery Sooner: Comparative case studies show achievement of greater ROM in less time than is possible with traditional therapy. GenuEase can be used as soon as the patient can sit unassisted \u2013 usually upon discharge from the hospital.<\/p>\n<p>Additional Proposed Demo-Event Locations for 2024:<\/p>\n<p>Abilene, TEXAS<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nLas Vegas, NEVADA<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nLos Angeles, CALIFORNIA<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMesa, ARIZONA<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nNew York, NEW YORK<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nGadsden, ALABAMA<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nChicago, ILLINOIS<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAtlanta, GEORGIA<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHouston, TEXAS<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nJackson, MISSISSIPPI<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nJacksonville, FLORIDA<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAspen, COLORADO<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSan Diego, CALIFORNIA<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSan Antonio, TEXAS<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nWeirton, WEST VIRGINIA<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nColumbus, OHIO<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFairview, NEW JERSEY<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBoston, MASSACHUSETTS<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nOrem, UTAH<\/p>\n<p>Tentative Locations for 2025:<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0Dallas, Texas<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Detroit, Michigan<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0San Jose, California<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Indianapolis, Indiana<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0San Francisco, California<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Austin, Texas<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Memphis, Tennessee<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Baltimore, Maryland<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Charlotte, North Carolina<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Fort Worth, Texas<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Milwaukee, Wisconsin<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0El Paso, Texas<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Washington, District of Columbia<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Nashville-Davidson, Tennessee<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Seattle, Washington<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Denver, Colorado<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Portland, Oregon<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Oklahoma City, Oklahoma<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Tucson, Arizona<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Albuquerque, New Mexico<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Atlanta, Georgia<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Long Beach, California<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Kansas City, Missouri<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Fresno, California<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0New Orleans, Louisiana<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Cleveland, Ohio<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Sacramento, California<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Virginia Beach, Virginia<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Omaha, Nebraska<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Colorado Springs, Colorado<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Oakland, California<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Miami, Florida<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Tulsa, Oklahoma<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0Minneapolis, Minnesota<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">J.
