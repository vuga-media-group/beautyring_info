This gravitation toward self-created and digital materials is complemented by an increasing awareness of open educational resources (OER), which are free to use, edit and share. More than one in four (28%) teachers are now aware of OER and Creative Commons licensing\u2014an uptick of six percentage points compared to the 2021-22 school year. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe popularity of digital and self-created materials underscores how much teachers value flexibility and customizability in their instructional materials,\u201d said Julia Seaman, who led the study for Bay View Analytics. \u201cBecause OER can be easily customized and shared, it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see both awareness and use of OER spread among K-12 educators in the future.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Other key findings from the survey include:<br \/>\u2022\tTextbooks remain a fixture in classroom instruction, as 72% of teachers say they require a textbook in their classrooms.<br \/>\u2022\tOver half of teachers agree that \u201cthey prefer print materials over digital for teaching\u201d (57%), and that \u201cstudents learn better from print materials than they do from digital\u201d (59%). Half of teachers agree that \u201cstudents prefer print over digital\u201d (50%).<br \/>\u2022\tMany teachers use digital tools in their classrooms on a daily basis. The most commonly used student-facing tools are laptops and tablets, and the most commonly used teacher-facing tools are digital grading and attendance tools. <br \/>\u2022\tWhile slightly more than half of teachers (51%) give their curriculum a grade of an A or B, only a third of teachers (33%) give their professional development similarly high marks. <\/p>\n<p>These results are part of an annual survey of educators conducted by Bay View Analytics, tracking curricula adoption decisions in K-12 in the U.S. The project is supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and Online Learning Consortium.
