Stationed in <span class=\"xn-location\">Washington, DC<\/span>, Pat became one of the first 200 WAVES to be deployed overseas \u2013 in her case, to the then Territory of Hawai&#8217;i. There, she served as an educator, teaching service members how to read and write and helped in the hospital attending the wounded.<\/p>\n<p>Pat met her husband, Gerald, at <span class=\"xn-location\">Pearl Harbor<\/span>, who was active-duty Navy himself and were married for 71 years. Prior to participating in the Flag Retreat ceremony, Pat visited Frontierland in Magic Kingdom, which her late husband helped bring to reality. Gerald was part of the construction team that built the structures in this area of the theme park, as well as parts of EPCOT and the original resort hotels of Walt Disney World.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I was really happy the buildings he helped build in Frontierland are still there,&#8221; said Rudd. &#8220;I&#8217;m proud of him and that his work has brought so much joy to so many people here at Disney.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Honoring Pat during the day&#8217;s events were members of Disney SALUTE, a veteran employee resource group, including <span class=\"xn-person\">Susan Finnigan<\/span>, Lead Project Manager for Disney marketing and a U.S. Marine Corps veteran.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Pat&#8217;s unwavering spirit and commitment to duty are an inspiration to fellow servicewomen,&#8221; said Finnigan. &#8220;It was an honor to be able to join my fellow veterans here at Disney to help celebrate a trailblazer and hero like Pat.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On <span class=\"xn-chron\">June 12, 1948<\/span>, three years after the end of World War II and Rudd&#8217;s naval service, President <span class=\"xn-person\">Harry S. Truman<\/span> signed the Women&#8217;s Armed Services Integration Act into law, officially opening the door for women to serve as full, permanent members of all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. The day is recognized annually as Women Veterans Day.<\/p>\n<p>Disney has long honored those who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces throughout the 100-year history of The Walt Disney Company. That tradition continues today with events like the daily Flag Retreat ceremony at Magic Kingdom, where an active-duty military member or veteran is selected from the park&#8217;s daily visitors to be honored.<\/p>\n<p>Disney is honored to offer a heartfelt tribute to the unsung female military heroes of the past and all those who continue to serve today.<\/p>\n<p><b><u>About Disney Parks, Experiences and Products<\/u><\/b> <br class=\"dnr\">Disney Parks, Experiences and Products brings the magic of The Walt Disney Company&#8217;s powerful brands and franchises \u2014 including Disney, Pixar, Marvel,\u00a0<i>Star Wars<\/i>, ESPN, Twentieth Century Studios and National Geographic \u2014 into the daily lives of families and fans around the world to create magical memories that last a lifetime.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>When <span class=\"xn-person\">Walt Disney<\/span> opened Disneyland in <span class=\"xn-location\">Anaheim, California<\/span>, on <span class=\"xn-chron\">July 17, 1955<\/span>, he created a unique destination built around storytelling and immersive experiences, ushering in a new era of family entertainment.
