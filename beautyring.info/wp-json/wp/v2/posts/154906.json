A Marriott Autograph Collection, this 4-star boutique hotel includes 164 sleek guest rooms and suites, a luxury spa, fitness facility, a gourmet three-meal restaurant, lobby bar, and a rooftop bar and amenity space with unobstructed views of Mt. Rainier and the Sammamish Valley. The hotel will also be a coveted event facility, with 10,000 feet of space for banquets, weddings, corporate retreats, and special\u00a0 events. With a main-level bridge connecting The Somm. directly to the Yard, it will be easy to stay and play at Harvest. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>Living at Harvest.<\/b> <br class=\"dnr\"><span>River Run at Harvest, with its 31 <\/span>townhomes<span> located alongside the <\/span><span class=\"xn-location\">Sammamish<\/span><span> <span class=\"xn-person\">River Tail<\/span>, will be fully complete by mid-2025, with the first homes move-in-ready by the end of 2024.
