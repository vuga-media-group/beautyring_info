Bronchodilators have become an essential medication for treating these diseases and relieve their symptoms.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Exposure to air pollution increases the risk of developing non-communicable diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ischemic heart disease, and stroke. The growing prevalence of these diseases is set to bolster sales of bronchodilators through 2034.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Governments worldwide are also supporting the growth of the global bronchodilator market by increasing awareness among the population through patient education programs. These are the reasons why the market for bronchodilators is expanding.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Key players are focusing on novel product development with enhanced efficacy. They are investing heavily in research and development to develop new medications for respiratory diseases.
