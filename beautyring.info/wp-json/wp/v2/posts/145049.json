Forced into a marriage of convenience with Prince Louis, known as the &#8216;Beheader,&#8217; Bella finds herself in a world of intrigue and danger. When Prince Louis steals the burial shroud of Jesus from crusaders who protect it, Bella is faced with a choice that could change the course of her life.<\/p>\n<p>As strange occurrences and miracles unfold in the castle, Bella must choose between her husband and her newfound beliefs. With faith and courage, she embarks on a journey that challenges the very essence of her existence.<\/p>\n<p>Critics praise that this book is, \u201cfor every Christian on the planet,&#8221; and that, \u201cIn a nutshell, this book is the best Christian book ever written.\u201d Also, The Moving Words review calls &#8220;Keeper of the Shroud\u201d as \u201ca refreshing take on a familiar genre, a valuable read for anyone seeking both escape and enlightenment.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Facts Behind the Fiction. The linen shroud which supposedly served as a burial cloth for Jesus Christ is known today as the Shroud of Turin. Documented reports by theologians recount healings of the sick, as well as a glowing warmth of the cloth years after Jesus\u2019 death. In 944 A.D., the material was called the Edessa cloth. According to historical accounts this controversial linen has been rescued from several fires and disappeared in the year 1209 A.D. On this basis, The Keeper of the Shroud presents a fictionalized account of what might have happened to this linen during those missing years. The setting of Keeper of the Shroud begins in a castle which stands today in southern France, Carcassonne.<\/p>\n<p>This novel is a captivating story of love, faith, and the power of redemption.
