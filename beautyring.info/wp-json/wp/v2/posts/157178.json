The collection includes rare artifacts from Gloria Grahame (\u201cViolet Bick\u201d), Carol Coombs (&#8220;Janie Bailey&#8221;), Jimmy Hawkins (&#8220;Tommy Bailey&#8221;), Jeanine Roose (&#8220;Young Violet Bick&#8221;), Virginia Patton (\u201cRuth Dakin Bailey\u201d), Donald &amp; Ronald Collins (\u201cLittle Pete\u201d), Lynne O\u2019Leary (\u201cJanie\u201d as a baby), photographs and mementos from the Capra Family, original call sheets with doodles by Art Director Jack Okey, angel wing pin worn to the film\u2019s premiere by the wife of Set Decorator Emile Kuri, premiere programs, rare autographed photographs, original foreign posters, handprints of iconic cast members including James Stewart and Karolyn Grimes, and treasured artifacts donated by fans of the film.<\/p>\n<p>In coordination with the museum, the community sponsors an annual, three-day It\u2019s a Wonderful Life Festival in December, focusing on the message of the Frank Capra movie and connection to Seneca Falls. This year\u2019s celebration is planned for Dec. 13-15.<\/p>\n<p>The 1946 film It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, directed by Frank Capra, starring James Stewart and Donna Reed, is an enduring classic, known for its powerful message and heartwarming story. The film gained recognition as one of the greatest of all time, cemented as a staple of American cinema and Christmas tradition. Frank Capra&#8217;s It\u2019s a Wonderful Life tells the story of George Bailey, a man who sacrifices his personal dreams to help others in his community. Facing a moment of despair on Christmas Eve, George&#8217;s guardian angel, Clarence Odbody, intervenes and reveals to him the profound impact he has had on the lives of those around him. The film\u2019s themes of self-worth, community, and the ripple effect of kindness have resonated with audiences for decades, making it an inspirational touchstone in film history.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Capra\u2019s triumph is that he brings an authentic humanity to every scene.&#8221; &#8211; Richard Corliss, TIME Magazine<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8220;James Stewart\u2019s performance is remarkable in its range and depth, demonstrating why he is considered one of the greatest actors of all time.&#8221; &#8211; Peter Travers, Rolling Stone<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8220;The way Capra composes scenes and the sincerity with which he portrays human emotions makes It\u2019s a Wonderful Life a masterpiece of American cinema.&#8221; &#8211; A.O. Scott, The New York Times<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8220;It\u2019s a Wonderful Life is, in fact, a wonderful film \u2013 one that is a treasure to be shared with generations to come.&#8221; &#8211; Leonard Maltin<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8220;More than just a great Christmas movie, it\u2019s a great movie, period, one that resonates with us because of its core belief in the fundamental goodness of people.&#8221; &#8211; Stephanie Zacharek, Village Voice<\/p>\n<p>WORKHOUSE is one of the country\u2019s leading public relations.
