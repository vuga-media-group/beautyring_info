There were people of<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\ndifferent nationalities who started new lives. Some were coming to terms with the loss of slaves<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nand maids, some coming to terms with a modern world, some coming to terms with science<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nand technology; the true slaves were now extinct.<\/p>\n<p>A full African could not be found; a new generation was formed. Negroide blood was its solvent but Jamaica was still under the rule of the British. Many Jamaicans believed then the national motto, \u2018Out of many , one people.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>But were we one? Are we?<\/p>\n<p>The stories told are entirely fictitious, but the era is real. The stories portray cultural examples<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nof the remnants of post-colonialism and how Jamaican culture is morphed.<\/p>\n<p>Jamaica in the 1920s was a hotbed of cultural activity. The island was a melting pot of African, European, and Caribbean influences. But beneath the surface, there was a dark side to Jamaican culture.<\/p>\n<p>There was a thriving underground economy in Jamaica in the 1920s. This was due in part to the fact that the island was a British colony. Jamaica was a major source of sugar, coffee, and other tropical commodities. But it was also a hub for smuggling and piracy.<\/p>\n<p>Jamaica was also home to a number of secret societies. These societies were often involved in illegal activities such as gambling, prostitution, and drug trafficking.<\/p>\n<p>The cultural flaws of Jamaica in the 1920s were largely hidden from the outside world. But they were an open secret among the island&#8217;s residents.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Edroy Whittingham<br \/>Wasps<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/653228086\/mailto:waspsjm@gmail.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">waspsjm@gmail.com<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/edroy.whittingham\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/edroyFR?t=dTcUR9agiZh_PnCMbfXrTw&amp;s=09\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/edroy-b-whittingham-aabba539\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/wasps.jm?utm_source=qr&amp;igshid=MzNlNGNkZWQ4Mg==\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=5lRcZ0Q-oe468I5V&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      September 01, 2023, 15:29 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/653228086\/newly-released-book-wasps-explores-clandestine-cultural-flaws-of-1920s-jamaica-through-fiction\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
