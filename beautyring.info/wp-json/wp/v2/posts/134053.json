As a work of historical fiction, the story unveils a hidden chapter in history that has been overlooked for centuries.<\/p>\n<p>In &#8220;BLOOD FOR PEARLS,&#8221; readers embark on a \u201cthrilling journey to the sixteenth century\u201d, a time when the third voyage of Christopher Columbus triggered a series of events that would forever alter the course of history. While the world often celebrates Columbus Day as a pivotal moment of discovery, this book uncovers a different reality. Long before Columbus, other Europeans had already crossed the Atlantic Ocean, including the Vikings and the Templars. However, it was Columbus and his crew&#8217;s discovery of the world&#8217;s richest pearl beds in 1498 that set the stage for an ill-intentioned turning point in time.<\/p>\n<p>The Southern Caribbean island of Cubagua is at the center of the thriller. There, inhumane acts forge a bond between characters Charaima, a Native American, and Dembe, who is African. Both Charaima and Dembe are enslaved by greedy and murderous European invaders. The sadistic pearl-fishing boat captain, Captain Pedro, adds further complication to the story as the duo attempts to stash away some of the pearls in hopes they can use them to free their people. <\/p>\n<p>The islands of the area, which were nicknamed &#8220;The Pearl Coast,&#8221; witnessed the culling of an estimated two hundred billion oysters that were fished, sorted, and examined for pearls. As a result, about twelve tons of pearls were exported to Spain while the oyster beds were permanently depleted. The relentless exploitation of the oyster beds set off a ripple effect that led to the annihilation of the entire Native population, all while the European monarchies stockpiled riches gained from the pearl trade. <\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CKQCZK53\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">In a little-known piece of history<\/a>, one that the history books forgot, \u201cBLOOD FOR PEARLS\u201d depicts some of the earliest African American slaves who were pearl divers brought to Cubagua Island to retrieve pearls for the wealthy. The book also takes readers on a journey that shows how hundreds of thousands of humans were massacred for the benefit of the European monarchies.<\/p>\n<p>In discussing his novel, Von Perle summed up the importance of the story in his statement that, \u201cShowing the gruesome reality serves as a stark reminder that the true savages were the invaders and not the native people.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>This Columbus Day, as the world commemorates the past, let &#8220;BLOOD FOR PEARLS &#8211; The First American Genocide&#8221; challenge your perspective and shed light on the untold stories of this pivotal moment in history. \u201cBLOOD FOR PEARLS\u201d will be available as an ebook and in paperback on Amazon.
