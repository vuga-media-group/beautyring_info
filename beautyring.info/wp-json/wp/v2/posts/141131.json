Almost everything on land, in the air, and at the bottom of the ocean is measured by surveyors. To preserve order in the physical world, most users rely on surveying. Land survey equipment, such as GNSS systems, total stations and theodolites, levels, 3D laser, and laser scanners, and unmanned aerial vehicles, is utilized in several industries, including construction, oil and gas, agriculture, mining, and disaster management, for inspection and monitoring, volumetric calculations, and layout points. The worldwide use of drones for photography and cinematography has increased. Computers and intelligent devices can remotely manage them. They are predominantly used for surveying and surveillance in the commercial and military sectors.<\/p>\n<p>The market for land survey equipment is propelled by urbanization and industrialization in developing countries where smart cities are being constructed. Land surveying is a significant factor in these cities&#8217; initial stages of development. Before its design and construction, surveying and inspection services would be necessary. Consequently, this aspect will serve as a growth driver for the land survey equipment market during the forecast period. In addition, due to its software&#8217;s simultaneous data processing, land surveying equipment saves a significant deal of time throughout its application process and yields accurate findings. However, many small enterprises offer rental and leasing services for land equipment, prohibiting direct end-users from acquiring their equipment. In addition, the market for land survey equipment requires skilled workers and technical knowledge of the equipment&#8217;s functioning and software. However, there are few such professional operators available.<\/p>\n<p><b>Download Free Sample Report PDF @ <\/b><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=mHxjTiBDvyxUJdw0aj9FIFRXfys0FXCDrFc6PcOJ6zfJjHV3cqsgbbWs0aURXfxtGspXgb68x67yX9T77ouAu9aUZb0Qxu-wc-QSicLjLsR0R8XneRTxhqAEXgZeZWWd1CebQrbUqRRBIPTgE9_-YZROLuXjhGZUsp9U9o0otLe53yisEuvKKFwNf65AXSl0LINjXIA42F6v1U6JoU9pvgxDN6FOM6KdkYdZ5RyeaS0VyYDVJsWkuhgZd1OcJy04\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b><u>https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/land-survey-equipment-market\/request-sample<\/u><\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>The Development of Smart Cities and Increased Drone Usage to Drive the Global Land Survey Equipment Market<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The growing urban population necessitates the planning and constructing cities with efficient administrative structures. The residents of a city must have access to water, energy, sanitation, and other necessities. As a result, a significant deal of consideration and planning has been committed to the building of new smart cities throughout the world. Singapore, Dubai, Amsterdam, London, New York, and Tokyo are projected to have smart cities, among others. In addition, almost one hundred Indian cities have been selected for transformation into smart cities. This strategy must evaluate and monitor land in and around cities where population growth is anticipated. Total stations &amp; theodolites, 3D lasers, and levels are projected to facilitate land measurement and the planning of construction of roads, buildings, and other infrastructures. As a result, the emphasis on smart city development is predicted to fuel the land survey equipment market over the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p>Computers and mobile devices are utilized for remote drone control. They are outfitted with cameras and other devices that capture images and transport data to a computer. Drones are used for construction monitoring, surveying, inspection, aerial photography, thermal sensors, geographical mapping, transportation, crop management, and crisis management. The usage of drones for land surveying has increased rapidly due to these advantages. In addition, drones measure vast areas without a human observer. GIS and 3D cameras generate more precise surveying information in the mining and agriculture industries. In recent years, significant firms have produced an enormous variety of specialized drones due to the increasing demand for drones in research and commercial applications. This boosts the land survey equipment market.<\/p>\n<p><b>Advancements in the Data Management System to Create Global Land Survey Equipment Market Opportunities<\/b><br \/>Recording and compiling the survey results for future use has made data management essential. For instance, the town planning committee can plan roads and structures while proposing an extension plan for the towns using data from survey lands in and around the cities. In addition, surveillance data collected at mine sites can be leveraged for production monitoring and planning. Similarly, the agriculture industry requires data management to verify crop health, pesticide application, and other harvesting methods. In addition, numerous new data compilation and storage programs are being developed. Consequently, it is projected that the modernization of data management systems will fuel the market for land survey equipment and generate opportunities throughout the projection period.<\/p>\n<p><b>Regional Insights<\/b><br \/>The Asia Pacific will command the market with the largest share while growing at a CAGR of 6.9%. China, India, and South Korea are among the rapidly urbanizing and industrializing nations. Multiple new construction projects are currently in progress. One hundred smart cities are anticipated to be built in India by 2025. Similarly, China intends to complete 12 smart cities by 2023. In addition, defense companies utilize drones and GNSS systems extensively. In addition, the mining industry employs total stations and 3D lasers for monitoring and inspection purposes.

However, the majority of land surveying technology is used to survey urban land for improved urban planning. Agriculture and disaster management are two more areas that employ land surveying technology for evaluation, monitoring, point layout, and calculation. In addition, the use of drones for surveying and monitoring in the mining and defense industries has increased significantly.<\/p>\n<p><b>Key Highlights<\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:0cm;\">Based on the product, the GNNS systems section will grow at a CAGR of 5.5% and hold the largest market share.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:0cm;\">Based on industry, the construction section will expand at a CAGR of 6.3% and hold the largest market share.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:0cm;\">Based on application, the inspection &amp; monitoring section is envisioned to expand at a CAGR of 6% and hold the largest share.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:0cm;\">Based on regional analysis, the Asia Pacific will command the market with the largest share while growing at a CAGR of 6.9%.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Competitive Players in the Market<\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:0cm;\">Hexagon<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:0cm;\">Hi-Target<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:0cm;\">Hudaco Industries Limited<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:0cm;\">Kolida Instrument Co., Ltd.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:0cm;\">Robert Bosch GmbH<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:0cm;\">Shanghai Huace Navigation Technology Ltd.
