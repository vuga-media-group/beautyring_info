It can be produced from brown, black, and yellow mustard seeds and the intensity of its flavor depends on the type of mustard seed used. Mustard flour is widely used in various cuisines, including sauces, seafood products, salad dressings, and processed foods, among others.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Demand for mustard flour is expected to rise steadily driven by changing consumer preferences, increasing urbanization, high disposable income, hectic schedules, and a lack of time to cook. However, demand for gluten-free and natural products is on the rise, which is also contributing to the growth of the mustard flour market. As more and more consumers are becoming health-conscious, the mustard flour market is expected to witness further growth in the coming years.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Mustard flour is gluten-free as it is made by crushing mustard seeds without adding any other ingredients to the flour. Gluten-free mustard flour is safe for people with celiac disease.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The flour is also high in antioxidants, which can help protect the body from the harmful effects of free radicals. Additionally, mustard flour is low in calories and high in fiber, making it a healthy addition to a gluten-free diet. Similarly, it is finding increasing use in health-beneficial and nutrient-rich food products, which are becoming increasingly popular among health-conscious consumers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get a sample copy to understand the complete structure of this report, comprising the summary and table of contents &#8211;
