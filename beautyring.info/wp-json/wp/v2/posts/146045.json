These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations of the combined public company and the Initial Portfolio, including as they relate to the potential Business Combination and related transactions, pricing and market opportunity, the completion of the potential Business Combination and related transactions, the level of redemptions by Jaws&#8217; public shareholders and the timing of the completion of the proposed Business Combination, including the anticipated closing date of the proposed Business Combination and the use of the cash proceeds therefrom. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this communication, and on the current expectations of Jaws&#8217; and the Starwood Capital Entities&#8217; management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as and must not be relied on by any investor as a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, conditions or results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside the control of the parties, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.<\/p>\n<p><b>Financial Data and Use of Projections and Illustrative Presentations<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If a legally binding definitive agreement with respect to the potential Business Combination is executed, the financial information and operating metrics contained in this presentation may be adjusted in or may be presented differently in the Registration Statement which may be filed by Jaws relating to the potential Business Combination and the proxy statement\/prospectus contained therein, and such adjustments may be material. In addition, this communication includes estimates of certain financial metrics of the Initial Portfolio that may differ from the Initial Portfolio&#8217;s actual financial metrics presented in any such proxy statement\/prospectus. The financial projections, estimates, targets and illustrative presentations in this presentation are forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies. The financial projections represent the view of the Starwood Capital Entities&#8217; management as of the date hereof. While all financial projections, estimates, targets and illustrative presentations are necessarily speculative, the Starwood Capital Entities believe that the preparation of prospective or illustrative financial information involves increasingly higher levels of uncertainty the further out the projection, estimate, target or illustrative presentation extends from the date of preparation. The assumptions and estimates underlying the projected, expected or target results are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the financial projections, estimates and targets. The inclusion of financial projections, estimates, targets and illustrative presentations in this communication should not be regarded as an indication that the Starwood Capital Entities, or their representatives, considered or consider the financial projections, estimates, targets and illustrative presentation to be a reliable predictions of future events. Further, illustrative presentations are not necessarily based on management projections, estimates, expectations or targets but are presented for illustrative purposes only.<\/p>\n<p><b>Use of Non-GAAP Financial Metrics<\/b><\/p>\n<p>This communication includes NOI, a non-GAAP financial measure (including on a forward-looking basis). The Starwood Capital Entities are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for non-GAAP NOI without unreasonable effort, and therefore no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP NOI financial measure is included. These non-GAAP measures are an addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. The Starwood Capital Entities believe that non-GAAP measures of financial results (including on a forward-looking basis) provide useful supplemental information to investors about the Initial Portfolio. The Starwood Capital Entities&#8217; management uses forward-looking non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Initial Portfolio&#8217;s projected financials and operating performance. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore, the Starwood Capital Entities&#8217; non-GAAP measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.<\/p>\n<p><b>Media Contacts<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Tom Johnson<\/span>, Dan Scorpio or
