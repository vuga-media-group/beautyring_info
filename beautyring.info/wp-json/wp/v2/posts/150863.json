This is in keeping with North American culture and way of life. NAMAIKU is a North American haiku, making no pretense to rival its sophisticated Japanese predecessors, but quite the opposite, humbly offering itself without pretense or ambition.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Elaborating on the concept, he added, \u201cThere are several conventions that haikuists \u2018work within\u2019. The most obvious is the 17-syllable maximum in a 5 7 5 pattern of 3 lines. It struck me that this was the basic root of the problem for the English writer, keeping aside cultural intricacies and differences. But the difference in languages calls for a radical adjustment, which is where I saw a possibility. I could keep a syllable count at 17, but the line pattern could be flexible, allowing English-speaking people, not just professed poets, to begin to express in words many of the \u2018fleeting impressions\u2019 and momentary awareness\u2019 ever happening in daily life&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>Examples : <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe leaves I gather                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAre glances,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           gestures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Of your quick passing    <\/p>\n<p>Purple Blue Red Green                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Umbrellas pass                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           the open door &#8211;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Rainy thursday                                                   <\/p>\n<p>Speaking on the NAMAIKU Concept, Irwin Rego, poet, thinker, brand consultant and founder of The Poetrywalla Diaries, with published poems in the UK, stated, &#8220;There is a need to sync thoughts, feelings, and words with the cultural fabric of the continent, and Allen has something here that we should sit up and take notice. A Japanese writer says more with a lot less. English being almost opposite in nature makes it difficult for the English writer tying to follow the haiku rules\u201d <\/p>\n<p>He further summed it up by saying \u201cPoetry is soul excavation in words, and syllables are the fun tools for the challenge when it comes to Haiku or Namaiku. Allen is a master of creative expression and words. We are looking at taking this further.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Art Bar Series recently celebrated 33 years with a meeting of established and young poets and their readings in Toronto, Canada.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFor further information on the concept, you could call 6474701268<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">I S Rego<br \/>Le artre<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/710098283\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=Oziwg1WZzh59BWXx&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      May 09, 2024, 07:35 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/710098283\/namaiku-the-north-american-version-of-haiku-presented-at-the-toronto-poets-meet\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
