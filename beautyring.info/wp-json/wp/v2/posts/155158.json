Its homestay sector operated by Chengtu Home (&#8220;Chengtu&#8221;), achieved an average occupancy rate of 79%, with sales increasing by 45% year-over-year. On the busiest day, the occupancy rate peaked at 88%, and sales surged by 31% from the previous year.<\/p>\n<p>In recent years, as the domestic tourism sector rebounds, homestays have become an increasingly popular lodging choice. Statistics from <span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> Ministry of Culture and Tourism show that domestic travel hit 295 million trips during the 2024 Labor Day holiday, up 7.6% year-on-year.

All housekeepers undergo specialized training and must pass thorough assessments before they begin their roles, adhering to strict guidelines for promotions and dismissals. Chengtu has standardized cleaning procedures for each stage of vacancy, occupancy and post-departure. After cleaning, a video is recorded to document the room condition, and regular inspections are conducted to ensure that properties remain clean until the end of the contract.<\/p>\n<p>Chengtu also pays close attention to the finer details to ensure guests feel right at home. Before guests arrive, Chengtu customizes the room settings based on their preferences, from themed decorations to personalized elements. Guests expressed how touched they were to find welcoming details like a chalkboard with personalized greetings or even hand-drawn portraits based on their social media profiles. These thoughtful details exemplify Chengtu&#8217;s warm and individualized approach to hospitality.<\/p>\n<p>Chengtu now spans 130 cities across the country, offering diverse lodging options from apartments to villas. Chengtu provides rooms for families, long-term renters, and business travelers, along with private areas ideal for group events.
