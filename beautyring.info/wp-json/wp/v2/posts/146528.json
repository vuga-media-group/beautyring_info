This is mainly because epoxy coatings are known for their excellent durability and resistance to environmental factors, such as corrosion and UV radiation, making them highly desirable for aircraft exteriors. Besides, advancements in epoxy coating technologies have led to the development of formulations that meet stringent environmental regulations, including regulations regarding volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and hazardous materials. Moreover, the increasing demand for high-performance and long-lasting coatings in the aircraft industry contributes to the growth of the epoxy sub-segment segment.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Aircraft <\/b><b>Type: <\/b><b>Narrow-body<\/b><b> Sub-segment to be Most Prominent During the Forecast Period<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The narrow-body sub-segment accounted for the largest market share of 41.4% in 2022 and is expected to hold its dominant position by 2032. This sub-segment is predicted to grow at the highest CAGR of 5.0% during the forecast period. This is mainly because as airlines expand their fleets or replace older aircraft with new narrow-body models, there&#8217;s a consequent surge in the demand for aircraft paint to coat these planes, spurring growth. In addition, stringent regulations set by aviation authorities regarding safety, durability, and environmental sustainability necessitate compliance with specialized and compliant aircraft paint is further driving demand within the narrow-body sub-segment.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Procure Complete Report (2<\/b><b>80<\/b><b> Pages PDF with Insights, Charts, Tables, and Figures) @<\/b> <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=N4NrVCi42bxqtQ6lOzD9pbsQQwcKPUS2UvrCoDWpE9Os4kw_medkvj86UiG7jXWzHZr-ZdHlxq0IgPq5lGCBPznr1x-sBWtLWGAKfbLymr0=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>https:\/\/bit.ly\/3Te2o6Y<\/b><\/a> \u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Application<\/b><b>: <\/b><b>Interior<\/b><b> Sub-segment to Witness Significant Growth by 2032<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The interior sub-segment accounted for the largest global aircraft paint market share of 59.3% in 2022 and is expected to hold its dominant position during the forecast period. One of the primary reasons for this dominance is the airlines&#8217; pursuit of unique and visually appealing interior designs to bolster their brand image, which fuels demand for customized paints. Additionally, the need for durable interior paints capable of withstanding substantial wear and tear from passenger traffic and maintenance procedures drives the demand for the sub-segment, reducing maintenance costs and downtime.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>End-user<\/b><b>: <\/b><b>Commercial Aircraft<\/b><b> Sub-segment to Flourish Immensely During the Forecast Period<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The commercial aircraft sub-segment accounted for the largest market share of 70.3% in 2022 and is expected to continue to dominate in terms of market share and grow at the highest CAGR of 4.8% during the forecast period. This is mainly due to the demanding operational environments of military aircraft, necessitating high-quality paint and coatings to protect against corrosion and enhance stealth capabilities. Besides, adherence to stringent safety and regulatory standards, mandating the use of specific paints and coatings and the need for distinctive paint schemes for identification and aesthetic purposes are the factors driving the growth of the commercial aircraft sub-segment.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Region: Asia-Pacific Market to Hold Major Market Share by 2032<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=RTeO4Sg8YsVZRE1jKXwJ86qY_bNjlTuj8aDUFLLTBAl7N6d6_WVewZfFAfJJvYgSsBsZpxDJqeEFAHycTPAo44kKR0uHfu6w40dg161kIkimoq7I99c8Bs886xl0wiYbFEuNTUKE2HQCT56I5K42vMqCmZORjSB2wFfraL2Afdo=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>aircraft<\/b><b> paint market<\/b><\/a> in the Asia-Pacific region accounted for the largest share of 36.6% in 2022 and is predicted to continue to hold major market share by 2032.
