She now limps forward with the help of an exoskeleton leg. Despite countless obstacles in her way, she has forged an extraordinary path. At just 24, she immigrated to the United States in 2000 and completed both her M.S. and Ph.D. in two different engineering fields within just 4 years, followed by a business program at Stanford Business School. When told that her polio-stricken leg would prevent her participating in sports, Libo again defied all expectations and completed a grueling 100-mile bike ride, battling against 50 mph winds for 11.5 hours.<\/p>\n<p>Libo will be speaking about her incredible journey as a keynote speaker at one of Silicon Valley&#8217;s most prestigious conferences: \u2018Women of Silicon Valley 2023\u2019 on May 25th, 2023.<\/p>\n<p>Libo Cao Meyers is also delving into her inspiring personal journey through the release of her remarkable memoir, \u201cLimp Forward: A Memoir of Disability, Perseverance, and Success.&#8221; She shares her personal journey about overcoming continuous discrimination as a woman in tech, a first-generation immigrant, and a member of the disability community. In celebration of AAPI Heritage Month and its theme, &#8220;Advancing Leaders Through Opportunity,&#8221; Libo strives to remind emerging AAPI leaders facing their own challenges of their inherent value and the possibilities of fulfilling their full potential, no matter the limitations they may face. <\/p>\n<p>She joined <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.hopeservices.org\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Hope Services<\/a>, the first nonprofit organization that she felt deeply connected to, as a Board Member in 2020 where she lends her valuable insight in technology and innovation to support their mission of helping people with disabilities, increasing accessibility to low-income families, and promoting early childhood engagement. Through Hope, she believes that a true difference can be made in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Libo has pledged a 5X match donation to Hope Services for each eBook sold at $2.99 during the promotion period, 5\/23 &#8211; 7\/3, for up to 2000 copies.
