However, the interests of American corporations and of the wealthy to maximize the profitability of their enterprises, coupled with their enormous political power, has made the fight for adequate and fair pay an ongoing struggle. The US has some of the lowest unionization rates in the world and, not coincidentally, the greatest income inequality compared with other high-income, Western democracies. The top 1% take home 21% of all the income in the United States <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.epi.org\/multimedia\/unequal-states-of-america\/#\/United%20States\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">(EPI 2023<\/a>). The average income for the top 1% is $1.3 million, whereas the average for the 99% is $50,000.<\/p>\n<p>Income inequality is associated with a surprising decrease in U.S. life expectancy compared to other high income countries. Sharp increases in \u201cdeaths of despair\u2019, opioid overdoses, suicide, alcoholic liver disease, and increased heart disease among working age people is to blame. All of these health problems are associated with stressful work and poor economic conditions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWorking conditions have become more arduous, with longer work hours and overtime, more precarious work, increased work-family conflict, and pay that has not kept up with inflation,\u201d says Dr. Peter Schnall.<\/p>\n<p>Unions increase <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.epi.org\/publication\/unions-and-well-being\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">employee economic wellbeing and health.<\/a> Workers covered by a union contract earn 10% more than workers without a union contract but with similar education, occupation and experience. Pay gaps due to gender or race are minimized by union contracts. States with higher union density tend to have less uninsured populations, more paid sick leave and family leave laws, and a lower rate of deaths on the job. Union members are also less likely to be depressed, worried, sad or lonely, and have higher job satisfaction, according to research among two million workers in Europe and the US.<\/p>\n<p>There is a case to be made that unions contribute to healthy work, and that healthy work is good for workers as well as for businesses. Healthy work prevents illness, improves health &amp; well-being, and increases job satisfaction and the productivity of employees.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Zach Schnall<br \/>Bander Productions<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/653380031\/tel:+1 310-403-4964\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">+1 310-403-4964<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/653380031\/mailto:press@banderproductions.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">press@banderproductions.com<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/healthyworknow\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/healthyworknow\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/showcase\/healthyworknow\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/healthyworknow\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=A6h74hK10Mp0vKOI&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      September 04, 2023, 12:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/653380031\/this-labor-day-the-healthy-work-campaign-predicts-that-union-strikes-will-result-in-healthier-work\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
