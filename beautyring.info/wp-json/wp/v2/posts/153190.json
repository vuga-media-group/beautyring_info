Cremaschi and <span class=\"xn-person\">Nick Rose<\/span>, vice president, head of ESG, Royal Caribbean Group, teamed up to dive into &#8220;Royal Caribbean Group Reef&#8221;, a new coral restoration site for research and rehabilitation. Working together they laid the groundwork that will build up lively neighborhoods of coral colonies that provide shelter, food and nursery areas for numerous marine species.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Spending a big part of my life around our oceans, first as part of a Navy family and then starting my career as a shipboard environmental officer, I know first-hand how important it is to keep our oceans healthy to sustain our planet,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Nick Rose<\/span>, vice president, head of ESG at Royal Caribbean Group. &#8220;It was an incredible experience to come together with Benjamin and expert researchers to protect the beauty of the oceans and to be able to create opportunities for our local communities to join us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are excited to collaborate with Royal Caribbean Group in support of our efforts for coral reef restoration,&#8221; said Diego\u00a0Lirman, professor of marine biology and ecology and director of Rescue a Reef program at the Rosenstiel School.\u00a0 &#8220;Reef restoration is a vital component of maintaining healthy and productive coral reefs.
