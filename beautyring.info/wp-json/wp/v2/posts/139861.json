Setting a promise takes it to a new dimension. We are neurologically wired to keep our promises.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 John Assaraf, best-selling author and renowned personal development expert<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>OBERLIN, OHIO, UNITED STATES, December 27, 2023 \/<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/\" dir=\"auto\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">EINPresswire.com<\/a>\/ &#8212; As 2023 draws to a close, millions of people in the United States and around the world are formulating New Year&#8217;s resolutions for 2024. <\/p>\n<p>This well-meaning, but often futile, annual ritual inspired American actress and director Joey Lauren Adams \u2013 known for her roles in popular films such as &#8220;Chasing Amy&#8221; and &#8220;Big Daddy\u201d \u2013 to compose a tongue-in-cheek blessing: \u201cMay all your troubles last as long as your New Year\u2019s resolutions.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With Adams\u2019 humorous observation in mind, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.matthewcossolotto.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Matthew Cossolotto<\/a> \u2013 author of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Joy-Public-Speaking-Voice-Potential\/dp\/1736697609\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">The Joy of Public Speaking<\/a> \u2013 offers the following unsolicited advice for the coming year: \u201cResolutions don\u2019t work. Various surveys have shown that most resolutions are abandoned by February. So I urge people to turn New Year\u2019s resolutions into New Year\u2019s promises. Why? Because a promise is more powerful, more binding than either a resolution or a goal.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To underscore the power of making a promise, Cossolotto cites this familiar, painful-sounding rhyme from his childhood in the United States: \u201cCross my heart and hope to die. Stick a needle in my eye.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat catchy little rhyme never failed to get my attention,\u201d recalls Cossolotto. \u201cIt drove home the message that making a promise was serious business. I\u2019m here to tell you that making and keeping promises is not just for kids.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Cossolotto believes that a promise is like a goal or resolution on steroids. It comes from the heart, whereas goals and resolutions are more cerebral. By making a heartfelt promise, people feel more accountable. Their integrity is on the line. They have some emotional skin in the game. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI Made a Promise to My Mother on Her Deathbed\u201d<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nCossolotto talks about a life-changing promise he once made: \u201cI made a promise to my mother on her deathbed that I would finish writing a book she had been encouraging me to write and dedicate it to her memory. Her face lit up and she said: \u2018You do that, Matthew. You do that. This makes me very happy.\u2019\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Cossolotto knew right away that failure was not an option, that he had crossed the proverbial Rubicon. There was no turning back or making excuses. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m proud to say I kept that promise,\u201d continues Cossolotto. \u201cIt put me on my current path as an author, speaker, and coach. My mission is to spread the power of making a promise to millions of people around the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Joy of Public Speaking is the first book in Cossolotto&#8217;s personal empowerment trilogy. Two additional books are planned for publication in 2024. Harness Your HabitForce highlights the seven habits of FAILURE and SUCCESS. Embrace Your Promise Power features an extensive foreword by Jack Canfield, author of The Success Principles and co-creator of the Chicken Soup for the Soul<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> series. <\/p>\n<p>As part of his speaking and coaching business, Cossolotto recently launched a new website (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.MatthewCossolotto.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.MatthewCossolotto.com<\/a>), complete with a demo video and a lineup of Personal Empowerment Programs (PEPTalks). His overriding goal is to help his audiences and clients replace negative, disempowering habits of thought with positive, empowering mindsets. This approach applies to all three power tools in his Triad Empowerment System \u2013 Habits \/ Speaking \/ Promises \u2013 and his trilogy of books on these topics.<\/p>\n<p>As Jack Canfield (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.jackcanfield.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.jackcanfield.com<\/a>) writes in his foreword to Embrace Your Promise Power: \u201cWhen Matthew first told me about the heartfelt promise he made to his mother\u2026 I was hooked. There was something very attractive, almost magnetic, about this concept. And I say that as somebody who has been intimately involved in the personal development field for many years. I\u2019ve seen and heard just about everything\u2026 With a promise your heart and emotions are fully engaged. Because of this, a promise is what I call a personal empowerment \u2018twofer.\u2019 It combines The Power of Intention with The Law of Attraction.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>A case in point is the promise U.S President Joe Biden made to his son, Beau, who was losing his battle against brain cancer. In his book (Promise Me, Dad) President Biden recounts that Beau asked his father to promise that he would be OK after Beau passed away, that he would not use Beau\u2019s death as a reason to turn in but as a reason to turn out, to continue to be engaged and not to withdraw from public life. Cossolotto believes Joe Biden decided to run for President of the United States at least in part because he made that heartfelt promise to his son.<\/p>\n<p>Cossolotto concludes: \u201cFortunately, the power of a promise is something all people can readily access. And they can easily do so by turning goals and resolutions into heartfelt promises. Making a promise is a secret weapon in the personal empowerment arsenal. If people really want to make positive changes in their lives in 2024 and beyond \u2013 lose weight, get fit, travel, start a business, find that dream job, learn a foreign language, quit smoking, or write a book \u2013 the first step is to make a heartfelt promise. This unleashes an irresistible force that will help them follow through. Remember this: People can change a goal or resolution but they can only break a promise. And most people are loath to break their promises.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Cossolotto\u2019s Promise-Related Articles in Brussels-based <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/togethermag.eu\/personal-development-turn-resolutions-into-promises\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Together Magazine<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHere&#8217;s a link to Cossolotto\u2019s more detailed Together Magazine articles about turning resolutions and goals into promises:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/togethermag.eu\/personal-development-turn-resolutions-into-promises\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/togethermag.eu\/personal-development-turn-resolutions-into-promises\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>More About Matthew Cossolotto<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nCossolotto\u2019s high-level leadership communications career spans the corridors of power and influence on both sides of the Atlantic.
