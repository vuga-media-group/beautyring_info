Alongside the palace&#8217;s history, the hotel has a &#8216;second skin&#8217; design story bringing together the two sides of the city, Buda and Pest, with a playful juxtaposition. From soft layering to the use of metallic meshing to create perspective and intrigue throughout the hotel&#8217;s public spaces and guestrooms, the design concept has created spaces that reveal new depths each time they are experienced.<\/p>\n<p>Further inspiration has been sourced from the grand French Renaissance architectural aesthetic throughout the city, leading to a spirited modernisation with colour palettes of green, coral and deep blues and paired with contemporary Zsolnay inspire tiles, stained glass features and jewellery-inspired light fittings. <span class=\"xn-location\">Hungary&#8217;s<\/span> vibrant and eclectic cultural scene, including the city&#8217;s famous love of chess and deep-rooted connection to ballet, can also be seen throughout the new hotel. Subtle nods to both are expressed in the form of bespoke chess-piece lamps and monochrome tiled marble flooring or soft pink hues, curved lines and lighting inspired by the graceful fluidity of the dance form. A few of <span class=\"xn-location\">Hungary&#8217;s<\/span> most famous exports, Harry Houdini and <span class=\"xn-person\">Zsa Zsa Gabor<\/span>, have sparked a creative vision for the interior concept, expressed using mirrors to create optical illusions and nostalgic touches of <span class=\"xn-location\">Hollywood<\/span> glamour.<\/p>\n<p>The intertwining design narratives are present throughout the hotel&#8217;s 151 distinctive guestrooms, including 45 suites. The fifth floor&#8217;s unique wooden-centric style is sympathetic to the Palace&#8217;s original roof design that has been restored, while the hotel&#8217;s connection to ballet is reflected in the all-black Extreme WOW suite and all-white WOW suite \u2013 a celebration of the famous ballet Swan Lake.<\/p>\n<p><b>Fusion Dining and a Timeless Cocktail Culture Ignites Curiosity\u00a0<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Shaking up the city&#8217;s culinary scene, <span class=\"xn-location\">W Budapest<\/span> opens with three new imaginative dining concepts, curated to spark curiosity and foster connections between guests and locals alike. Under the helm of world-class restaurateur <span class=\"xn-person\">Riccardo Giraudi<\/span>, the hotel&#8217;s destination restaurant, <b>Nightingale by Beefbar,<\/b> is the gastronomic heart of the hotel. A spinoff of the famous Beefbar concept, the restaurant offers an approachable introduction to Asian cuisine, pairing fresh traditional Asian flavours with a selection of Beefbar&#8217;s signature and iconic meat dishes for a vibrant culinary experience. Spearheading the Nightingale by Beefbar kitchen is <span class=\"xn-person\">Fabio Polidori<\/span>, who has curated a sociable menu of small plates designed to be shared with friends. Signature dishes include crispy carpaccio drizzled in a piquant chipotle dressing, yellowtail sashimi with yuzu truffle sauce and the playfully named <span class=\"xn-person\">Miss Bao<\/span>, which invites diners to dip caramelized banana into a divine dark chocolate sauce. The bar at Nightingale by Beefbar offers a host of creative cocktails, from bourbon-based <i>Nightingale Boulvardie<\/i> to the gin and sweet wine-based cocktail <i>Budapest Calling<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>A destination for those in the know, <b>Society25<\/b> is the hotel&#8217;s exclusive speakeasy located in the basement. Society25 takes inspiration from the creative conversations and secret table societies that frequented the space in its past life, offering a fiercely intimate and socially liberating experience. The extensive cocktail list offers eight bespoke cocktails paying homage to the great eras, people and buildings within the city, each including a mysterious ingredient, expertly overseen by Head Bartender Stefano Ripiccini. Guests can take their pick from <i>The Illusionist <\/i>named after the great Houdini; <i>Brew Bop<\/i> which nods to <span class=\"xn-location\">Budapest&#8217;s<\/span> Golden Age of coffee and <i>Geranium<\/i> inspired by Drechsler Palace itself.<\/p>\n<p><b>Meet You at W\u00a0<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Located on the ground floor, seamlessly blending into Nightingale restaurant, is W Lounge \u2013 the social epicentre of the hotel. From business meetings and light lunches to late-night revelry, W Lounge transcends day to night, serving sharing plates and signature cocktails to a backdrop of electrifying DJ performances as the sun sets over Budapest.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The new hotel also boasts several meeting and event spaces, including the Great Room, which is ideal for grand celebrations, and two Studio Rooms for business meetings and intimate gatherings.<\/p>\n<p><b>A Social Beacon<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>This is a place that&#8217;s &#8216;always on&#8217;.
