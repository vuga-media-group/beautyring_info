The changes announced directly reflect the Company&#8217;s pledge to deliver the most comprehensive, performance-driven management service in the industry and showcase its desire to be recognized as the clear third-party leader among owners, brands, and associates.<\/p>\n<p>The addition of an <b>Owner Relations team<\/b> nods to the ever-evolving, fast-paced environment hotel owners, asset managers, and hospitality brands face daily and looks to provide partners with superior solutions that meet their biggest challenges.<\/p>\n<p>The team will proactively mine proprietary data and insights, source and synthesize stakeholder feedback, and partner across the organization to accelerate actions that result in higher portfolio profitability and improved satisfaction scores. They will also be responsible for launching the <b>Aimbridge Owners Council, a new advisory committee<\/b> that will include representatives across ownership groups and serve as a valuable resource as the Company looks to make ongoing enhancements to its product offerings.<\/p>\n<p>Leading the team is <b>Aly El-Bassuni,<\/b> <b>Divisional President \u2013 Owner Relations<\/b>. El-Bassuni joined Aimbridge in 2023 as Divisional President \u2013 Enhanced Select Service and has a strong track record of building outstanding partnerships and driving operational results. El-Bassuni will report to <span class=\"xn-person\">Allison Reid<\/span>, Chief Global Growth Officer for Aimbridge.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The addition of a dedicated Owner Relations team builds on the work that&#8217;s been done over the last two years and points to the ongoing investment Aimbridge is making in helping owners meet ambitious goals,&#8221; said Mark Tamis, Global President \u2013 Aimbridge. &#8220;This team will be focused on looking across the portfolio for opportunities that drive performance, mobilizing expert resources across the organization, and implementing improvements that benefit our partners.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To enable faster results, the Company will simplify its U.S. Operations into two divisions with its above property operations teams shifting to drill down on actions that drive better property-level performance, associate engagement, and owner satisfaction. The two divisions will be:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><b>Aimbridge Select<\/b>, a comprehensive select service division that includes select enhanced, select, economy, and extended stay properties, that will be led by <b><span class=\"xn-person\">Simon Mendy<\/span>, Divisional President \u2013 Select Service<\/b>.<br class=\"dnr\">\u00a0<\/li>\n<li><b>Aimbridge Full Service<\/b>, a full service, luxury, and resort business, including Evolution, Aimbridge&#8217;s Lifestyle vertical, that will be led by <b><span class=\"xn-person\">Rob Smith<\/span>, Divisional President \u2013 Full Service<\/b>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Both Mendy and Smith are longtime industry leaders and Aimbridge executives who bring deep operational know-how to the verticals they are tasked with overseeing. The new operating structure is set to go into effect in mid-February, following a brief transition period.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The industry is at an inflection point as brands continue to move to a predominantly franchised model and owners lean on third-party managers to provide the operating experience and track record they need to succeed, which is where Aimbridge shines,&#8221; continued Tamis. &#8220;The strategic shifts we&#8217;re making to our U.S. operating model will inject even greater agility and effectiveness into how we run our business, and ultimately, drive higher property and portfolio performance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The expanded Aimbridge Select division will be responsible for managing a robust coast to coast portfolio, deeply embedded in key travel markets including <span class=\"xn-location\">Chicago<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Washington, D.C.<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Houston<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles<\/span> and more. Today, Aimbridge Select boasts a brand-rich mix of properties representing the most well-known hotel flags like Courtyard by Marriott, AC Hotel, Hilton Garden Inn, Hilton Home2 Suites, Hyatt Place, Holiday Inn, Comfort Inn, Days Inn, Extended Stay America, and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>The new Aimbridge Full Service division portfolio, including lifestyle properties managed by Evolution, features properties in some of the most iconic and sought-after destinations in the U.S., the <span class=\"xn-location\">Caribbean<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Canada<\/span>. Highlights include award-winning management of the HALL Arts Hotel Dallas, Yours Truly in <span class=\"xn-location\">Washington, D.C.<\/span>, The Highlander Hotel Radford in <span class=\"xn-location\">Virginia<\/span>, Hotel Milo in <span class=\"xn-location\">Santa Barbara, California<\/span>, and Morningstar Buoy Haus Beach Resort at Frenchman&#8217;s Reef, an Autograph Collection property in St. Thomas, <span class=\"xn-location\">U.S. Virgin Islands<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>As part of its strategic enhancement plan, Aimbridge also plans to redeploy its above-property operations teams by geography to reinforce and strengthen the close-knit and collaborative network between hotel and above-property support teams and deepen its market expertise.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The combination of proven brand and operating abilities, extensive market knowledge, and meaningful scale is unique to Aimbridge and sets us apart. When paired with our dedicated account management, we&#8217;re able to offer the industry&#8217;s most comprehensive management service and help owners of any size gain a competitive edge,&#8221; said Tamis. &#8220;Our commitment as the leader in the third-party hotel management space has always been, and will continue to be, finding ways to exceed the expectations of our owners, brand partners and associates. By building on the strong foundations already in place, we will accelerate future growth for our partners and for Aimbridge.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Operations in the company&#8217;s international divisions servicing EMEA and LATAM remain unchanged.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Aimbridge Hospitality and Evolution, visit\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\"
