Turkeltaub emphasizes the importance of thorough preparation and consideration before undergoing female-to-male (FTM), gender nonbinary (FTN) or <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.turkeltaub.com\/transgender\/mtf-top-surgery\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">male-to-female (MTF) top surgery<\/a>. With a commitment to providing compassionate, affirming care and exceptional results, Dr. Turkeltaub offers guidance on the critical aspects prospective patients should consider ahead of their procedure.<\/p>\n<p>Physical Readiness<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nOne of the primary considerations is the individual\u2019s physical health. It is recommended for patients to maintain a stable, relatively healthy weight after top surgery, as significant fluctuations can affect surgical outcomes and the healing process. Additionally, patients should refrain from smoking cigarettes or marijuana and vaping, as these activities can significantly increase the risk of complications, delay recovery and lead to less than optimal outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>Emotional and Psychological Preparedness<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nUnderstanding the emotional and psychological impacts of top surgery is vital. Dr. Turkeltaub notes that while top surgery patients are typically among the happiest and most satisfied, it can still be an emotional process. Patients are encouraged to engage in discussions with therapists or counselors who specialize in gender identity to ensure emotional stability and readiness for the changes that accompany this life-altering surgery. It is also required that they have a full evaluation related to their gender issues, which can be very helpful in minimizing the risks for regret or even detransition at a later date. <\/p>\n<p>Realistic Expectations<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDr. Turkeltaub stresses the importance of having realistic expectations about the surgical outcomes. While top surgery can be truly transformative for transgender and gender nonbinary patients, it is essential to understand the potential limitations and risks associated with the procedure. Detailed consultations with a board-certified plastic surgeon are imperative to align expectations with achievable results.<\/p>\n<p>Choosing the Right Surgeon<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSelecting a qualified and experienced plastic surgeon is paramount. Prospective patients should verify the surgeon\u2019s credentials, including board certification and specific experience with gender-affirming surgeries. Dr. Turkeltaub is a member of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), an organization that sets international quality standards relating to the care of gender diverse individuals. Viewing before-and-after photos of previous surgeries performed by the surgeon can also provide insight into their expertise and aesthetic style.<\/p>\n<p>Postoperative Care and Support<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nUnderstanding the postoperative care process is crucial for a smooth recovery and optimal outcomes. Dr. Turkeltaub provides comprehensive post-surgery guidelines and encourages patients to have a support system in place to assist with recovery.<\/p>\n<p>Insurance and Costs<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFinally, potential costs and insurance coverage are significant considerations. Dr. Turkeltaub\u2019s team completely addresses insurance related issues for his patients\u2014minimizing the burden and stress that they would otherwise have to deal with. <\/p>\n<p>Dr. Turkeltaub and his team at the Arizona Center for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery are dedicated to providing the highest standard of care and support through every step of the top surgery process.
