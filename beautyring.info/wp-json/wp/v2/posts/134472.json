Elmore joined the movement with Rev. James Bevel.   Bevel was the chief strategist for Dr. Martin Luther King.   Bevel was the brain child of the Selma to Montgomery march, the 1963  Children&#8217;s crusade in Alabama and the person who motivated voting rights activist in Mississippi Fannie Lou Hammer.  The room where Dr. King got Killed in Memphis was Bevel&#8217;s room whereas they switched Bevel&#8217;s room for opportunity to murder Dr. King.<\/p>\n<p>Elmore in his 1988 Film &#8220;The Contemporary Gladiator&#8221; asked Dr. David Acey who is founder of the Memphis  &#8220;Africa in April Celebration&#8221; to play the role of  Bevel in Elmore&#8217;s film. <\/p>\n<p>Elmore notes that just four years after  the ABC Television show roots premiered in 1977 and also in 1977 Muhammad Ali played himself in the movie &#8220;The Greatest&#8221; Elmore was the 1st person to bring E.S.P.N. to Memphis in 1981.  Elmore produced Kickboxing shows that aired of Black Entertainment Television in 1986, whereas Elmore became inspired by the 1986 Spike Lee Black and White Film &#8220;She&#8217;s Gotta Have it,&#8221; whereas Elmore re-enrolled in College and took an English and Typing Course thereby Elmore wrote a movie script and set out to produce a movie about his life story.<\/p>\n<p>Ironically Elmore met with Marius Penczner who was the Memphis State student who directed the 1982 student film &#8220;I was a Zombie for the FBI.&#8221; Penczner read Elmore&#8217;s script and declined to direct the film. However Penczner gave Elmore some life changing advice. He introduced Elmore to the book titled; &#8220;Independent Feature Film Production by Gregory Goodell.&#8221;  This book became Elmore&#8217;s Filmmaking Bible.<\/p>\n<p>One has to look no further than January 7, 2023 when five Black police officers  brutally killed 29 year old Black  Tyre Nichols to realize that a culture of Black on Black racism exist in Memphis.   The April 23, 2023  Video below  Elmore begs newly appointed  Black Female  executive director of  Indie Memphis Kimel Fyer to stop its pattern and practices of supporting  White Supremacy, Racism and Black on Black Racism. <\/p>\n<p>On June 30, 2023 Elmore published an International News Release titled: &#8220;Orange Mound vs. Indie Memphis&#8217; Elmore explains how Memphis Film Culture Robs Historic Black Community of dignity of film Honor and Prestige.&#8221; <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einnews.com\/pr_news\/640021680\/orange-mound-vs-indie-memphis-how-memphis-film-culture-robs-historic-black-community-of-dignity-of-film-honor-prestige\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Click here to read news release.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Elmore says in the news release notes: &#8220;Indie Memphis&#8221; has been the paradigm   of &#8220;White Supremacy, Racism and now Black on Black Racism&#8221; whereas they used their platform to obscure Black Memphis Film history and deny Black Orange Mound out of its rightful place as &#8220;The Birthplace of Memphis Independent theatrical  filmmaking.&#8221; Until 2023 they never invited Elmore to an Indie Film festival or allowed his film history to be told.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The story of Memphis racist film history started in 1987 whereas Elmore was the 1st client of new  Shelby County Film Commissioner Linn Sitler.  Elmore whom had never walked on a film set ventured to make a film using the book as his  film guide.  There existed no 35mm film camera, film equipment or film lab or faculties in Memphis to produce a film.  Elmore traveled to Atlanta, found a film lab and a place to rent filmmaking equipment.  Elmore hired a Black Film crew from Chicago who lived in Elmore&#8217;s home, whereas they started shooting the film; &#8220;The Contemporary Gladiator in Black Orange Mound in Memphis in 1987. <\/p>\n<p>The White  Memphis  Film Commissioner Linn Sitler refuse to acknowledge the fact that Memphis first Independent 35mm Theatrical film was his 1988 film release was &#8220;The Contemporary Gladiator.&#8221;   Elmore explains that I create the 1st Kickboxing  film in American film history.  Elmore explains; we are role models, whereas we made not only Memphis 1st Independent film, we made the 1st Kickboxing film in American Film History.  Black youth should know that America&#8217;s 1st Kickboxing film is a Black film about a Black world champion,  made in a Black Community.<\/p>\n<p>Elmore explains when I was a child living in  segregated America  we had to enter the  rear door or the Malco Theatre downtown.  In 1988 I sat with the owner of the Malco Mr. Steve Lightman; whereas I was the 1st Memphis filmmaker to feature a movie in Memphis theatres.  Elmore encourages the readers to see the video posted 3 months ago:  Linn Sitler vs Black America USA Indie Memphis Joins In. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BV8YSHhC1zw\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Click here to see Video.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Elmore explains that Black Memphis should challenge &#8220;Indie Memphis&#8221; whereas they have two Black Women who continues the pattern and practices of White Supremacy, Racism; whereas they disrespect and disregard not only a Memphis five time world Kickboxing champion  who withdrew from their 26 Annual Film Festival whereas Indie Memphis refuse to acknowledge  Black Memphis film history that notes that &#8220;Orange Mound a Historic and first Community in America  built for Blacks by Black&#8221; is the &#8220;Birthplace of Independent theatrical Filmmaking in Memphis.<\/p>\n<p>A bright spot happen to Elmore.
