The bespoke furniture line, produced by world renowned Italian furniture manufacturer Roda, combines authentic Italian craftsmanship with state-of-the-art technology and innovation, with furnishings that celebrate the quality and design of the tools and clothing used in exploration. Framed in wood and metal, pieces radiate a sense of luxurious handcrafted ruggedness with textured fabric and leather, giving unmatched bespoke identity to every corner of the ship across its nine decks, and 132 oceanfront suites.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Details in suites include custom-designed switches on the bedside light panel that appear vintage and yet are ultra-contemporary in function, parchment-inspired wall panels finished with digitally printed wall laminate material that mimics wood with alluring, granular detail; heated flooring with wooden-look tiles; carpeting designed with organic shapes; and furniture with wood frames, exposed rivets, and bronze inlays. The duplex <b>Wintergarden<\/b> and <b>Grand Wintergarden Suites<\/b> feature a sculptural staircase leading to the bedroom, and advanced technology including a roll-up, tuck-away TV to preserve seamless, double-height views (two decks).\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Noteworthy design details continue in public areas throughout <i>Seabourn Pursuit<\/i>. The <b>Discovery Center<\/b>, for instance, which houses an immersive large screen for lectures and video experiences, has an academic, enriching environment inspired by the landscape of <span class=\"xn-location\">Antarctica<\/span>, incorporating a natural colour palette and organic shapes of topography maps that play off the elegant curves of plush custom seating and a unique textured liquid metal wall covering.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Within the comfortable and engaging <b>Expedition Lounge<\/b>, two fireplaces producing lifelike water vapor flames and a vintage map on an etched glass partition combine to create an enchanting ambiance that calls to the memories of past adventures. Custom furniture designed with warm natural materials and textures create a space that is inviting and tactile while echoing the sense of quality and craftsmanship of the instruments and tools of early explorers.<\/p>\n<p>The inviting <b>Seabourn Square<\/b> is the living room of the ship, offering a variety of outdoor settings for guests to relax in comfort and take in views with the aid of fixed Swarovski telescopes. Wood-backed scalloped banquettes and Tihany Product Design lounge chairs encircle live edge wood coffee and side tables, creating intimate gathering spaces. Wrapped in riveted leather wall panels, the room is topped with an overlapping circular panel ceiling, adding dimension and recalling the symmetrical composition of a compass. The Argyle-influenced carpet pattern adds warmth, and thoughtfully curated bookshelves, expedition art and accessories paint the picture of an explorer&#8217;s private home decked out with mementos and discoveries.<\/p>\n<div aria-level=\"3\" class=\"wcag-arialevel-3\" role=\"heading\" style=\"display: block; font-size: 1.17em; margin-block-start: 1em; margin-block-end: 1em; margin-inline-start: 0px; margin-inline-end: 0px; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;\">\n<b>Ultra-Luxury Gathering Spaces<\/b>\n<\/div>\n<p>The overall design scheme of <i>Seabourn Pursuit<\/i> balances the exploration theme with the comfort and luxury of an expedition vessel. Guests are encouraged to relax and enjoy downtime to complement daily adventures off ship, with interiors that carefully integrate light and space, a warm colour palette, and natural fibres. Different areas work together to optimize smooth passenger flow, inspiring a sense of ease throughout.<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>The <b>Atrium<\/b>\u00a0connects all guest-area decks via an elegant staircase with a sky-lit space complete with wood and metal finishes with details including rhythmically placed rope work and a topography-inspired liquid metal wall treatment. The diamond-shaped floor pattern emphasizes a captivating artwork created at the base of the space.<\/li>\n<li>The\u00a0<b>Landing Zone<\/b>\u00a0is the ship&#8217;s utility space where guests change, clean, and store boots and gear following excursions. Reimagined by Tihany Design as a comfortable setting of sleek, modern design, the Landing Zone combines a durable material palette of floor tile, wood, and metal details with rivet accents to evoke the characteristics of luggage as well as the orange-tinged uniforms of the crew.<\/li>\n<li>The\u00a0<b>Bow Lounge\u00a0<\/b>on Deck 6 provides the closest access to the water via the foredeck, making it a prime destination to watch for marine life. Comfortable and engaging, the lounge is designed to mimic elements of the Captain&#8217;s bridge, with expansive windows and interactive monitors displaying updated information about the day at sea. Touch screens offer a live map, weather information and more.<\/li>\n<li>The\u00a0<b>Constellation Lounge <\/b>offers stunning, 270-degree views as far as guests&#8217; eyes can see. Set on the top deck, its intimate interior is an ode to constellations, with a dark blue and red palette accented by silver and bronze metals and intricate stone floors, and lighting that generates a shimmering star-like pattern across the ceiling. A central bar is fashioned from faceted metal and stone and illuminated by a unique diamond-shaped lighting cove. Velvet banquettes and sling-back chairs by Tihany Design create a seductive and relaxed environment for enjoying live music.<\/li>\n<li><b>The Club<\/b>\u00a0features expansive windows, making it an ideal spot to watch the amazing scenery and wildlife. Fashioned with design touches using brilliant hues of blue and green inspired by the deep-sea and unique art displays, The Club has an impressive water-vapor fireplace set like buried treasure at the center of the venue, and a dedicated stage and dance floor for live performances. It also includes an extraordinary sushi experience, offering a variety of hand-prepared sushi bites freshly made to order every evening.<\/li>\n<li>The ship&#8217;s\u00a0<b>Spa &amp; Wellness<\/b>\u00a0integrates the design concept of a contemporary &#8220;floating forest,&#8221; with details such as a tree-inspired textured art mural, light wood and bronze material palette, and reception done up with live wood features. The fitness center and yoga areas feature an open wall of floor-to-ceiling windows for striking views looking out onto the world around you.<\/li>\n<li>The\u00a0<b>Restaurant\u00a0<\/b>merges bold lines and shapes with softness reminiscent of falling snow. Leather wall paneling is brought to life with a unique three-dimensional diamond arrangement and visible stitching, while geometric carpeting in blue and purple surrounds a porcelain tile floor that recalls the natural sediment of a geode. Custom-designed dining chairs produced by renowned Italian furniture manufacturer Roda echo craftsmanship throughout the ship with rich burgundy leather, textured fabric seat back, exposed rivet details, and wood frame. A wine display encased in bronze framed glass will inspire conversation as sophisticated as its inventory.<\/li>\n<li>The casual\u00a0<b>Colonnade\u00a0<\/b>dining space on Deck 5 takes inspiration from historic maritime design with a ceiling of riveted curved wood panels evoking the feel of a wooden hull of an early expedition ship, decorative metal plate details, wood flooring, and art displays of intricate nautical knots. Buffet stations are dressed up with three-dimensional textured tile and white stone countertops and set beneath a sleek copper ceiling for the feeling of a working kitchen. Guests are welcome to dine outside on the aft deck, home to an infinity-style pool, two whirlpools, and a pair of sculptural showers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For reservations or more details, please contact a professional travel advisor; call Seabourn at 1-800-929-9391 or visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3925023-1&amp;h=1665932729&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seabourn.com.%2F&amp;a=www.seabourn.com.\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.seabourn.com.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b><u>About Tihany Design:<\/u><\/b><br class=\"dnr\">Tihany Design is a multidisciplinary, ever-evolving design atelier specializing in luxury hospitality, cruise, retail, residences, private clubs, yachting, spa and leisure.
