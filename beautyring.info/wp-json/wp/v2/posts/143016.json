The story emphasizes mindfulness and choosing to break bad habits, especially parenting habits. This book is for people trying to accept their trauma and move forward with hope.<\/p>\n<p>Drawing a parallel with the biblical concept of a scapegoat. Miss Kelly relates her own experience as a family scapegoat. The book reflects on the emotional toll of being unfairly blamed or targeted within a family, exploring the theological perspective of Jesus as a scapegoat. Through personal reflections and biblical insights, Miss Kelly contemplates themes of forgiveness, redemption, and the transformative power of self-discovery.<\/p>\n<p>The story highlights dysfunctional family traits like abuse, fear, power struggles, and conditional love. Miss Kelly bravely admits that her family isn\u2019t perfect and that being a family scapegoat is due to a dysfunctional family structure. The author fights abusive cycles and helps parents improve their children\u2019s lives.<\/p>\n<p>After learning about her mother\u2019s prenatal physical abuse, Miss Kelly discusses her own struggles. Co-dependency, narcissistic abuse, and abandonment start the story. It then explores how horrific events shaped the author\u2019s childhood, setting the stage for a difficult journey. The story follows Miss Kelly\u2019s relationship with Jesus Christ as she recovers.<\/p>\n<p>This book details the biblical concept of a scapegoat and Leviticus ritual of assigning sins to an abandoned goat in the wilderness. Miss Kelly uses her own experience as a scapegoat to compare this ritual to the emotional and psychological toll unfair blame can have on a family.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Goat That Escaped &amp; Survived\u201d is not just a memoir; it is a testament to resilience, healing, and the indomitable human spirit. Miss Kelly\u2019s journey from being a family scapegoat to the \u2018goat that escaped, survived, and thrived\u2019 serves as an inspirational narrative of overcoming adversity through faith, self-discovery, and breaking generational cycles.<\/p>\n<p>About the Author:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMiss Kelly\u2019s new book provides a platform to share her experiences, embeds inspiration from biblical stories, and provides clinical evaluations. Her journey pivots towards a healthier future, shifting from co-dependency to reliance on God. Through the book, she boldly shares her story to help others going through similar struggles, offering hope for healing and growth.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Goat That Escaped &amp; Survived\u201d is not just a book; it\u2019s an invitation to embark on your own journey of escape, survival, and thriving.
