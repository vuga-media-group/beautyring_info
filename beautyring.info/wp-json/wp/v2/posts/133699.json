By leveraging both its natural beauty and strong tourism strategy, the country hopes to entice a record-breaking 10 million tourists to its shores by the end of 2023.<\/p>\n<p>Dominican Ministry of Tourism data suggests that this new form of luxury will attract more tourists, especially from the UK. Of the 173,728\u00a0UK tourists who visited the country in 2022, 33% chose luxury getaways. After identifying upward trends in luxury tourism and sustainability, the <span class=\"xn-location\">Dominican Republic<\/span> has adapted its tourism strategy to address both.<\/p>\n<p><b>Celebrating sustainability in Samana<\/b><\/p>\n<p>As part of this strategy, the <span class=\"xn-location\">Dominican Republic<\/span> has been introducing sustainable tourism offerings in its established destinations, such as the Cayo Levantado Resort in Samana. This destination combines luxury and sustainability by promoting the local culture, improving the region&#8217;s biodiversity and offering a space for visitors to connect with the natural environment. Samana is also the first municipality with a Sustainable Tourism Circuit, a business association dedicated to championing sustainability. Over 70 local companies have joined.<\/p>\n<p><b>Sharing the natural paradise of Pedernales Province<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Recently, the <span class=\"xn-location\">Dominican Republic<\/span> announced plans to develop a sustainable luxury tourism destination in <span class=\"xn-person\">Bahia de<\/span> las Aguilas. This will be the first carried out under a public-private partnership in the region. In the project&#8217;s first stage, the private sector will invest <span class=\"xn-money\">US$700<\/span>-800 million to build 3,000 rooms, an international airport, a 50KW renewable energy installation and related infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>This is not the only project taking place in Pedernales. After a <span class=\"xn-money\">US$98 million<\/span> investment in the Port of <span class=\"xn-person\">Cabo Rojo<\/span>, the Norwegian Cruise Line has its first arrival scheduled for <span class=\"xn-chron\">December 2023<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><b>Creating an ecotourism hub in Miches<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Another key destination for sustainable luxury tourism, Miches attracted <span class=\"xn-money\">US$735 million<\/span> in investments for new projects, including 3,700 more hotel rooms and 2,000 residential rooms. Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts is considering building a LEED-certified hotel in Miches, and multiple other major hotel groups have expressed interest in the area.<\/p>\n<p>SOURCE The Dominican Republic Ministry of Tourism<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt src=\"https:\/\/rt.prnewswire.com\/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LN30367&amp;Transmission_Id=202310050700PR_NEWS_USPR_____LN30367&amp;DateId=20231005\" style=\"display:none\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Originally published at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/the-dominican-republic-is-embracing-sustainable-luxury-tourism-to-maximise-its-appeal-301948264.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer sponsored\">https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/the-dominican-republic-is-embracing-sustainable-luxury-tourism-to-maximise-its-appeal-301948264.html<\/a><br \/>\n<font size=\"-1\"><em>Images courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/pixabay.com<\/a><\/em><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SANTO DOMINGO, Oct. 5, 2023 \/PRNewswire\/ &#8212; The Dominican Republic is combining traditional luxury elements with sustainable ideals in its sustainable luxury tourism strategy, which centres on consolidating its position as the top Caribbean tourist destination.
