Conversion of the hotels to IHG&#8217;s system will happen in phases beginning in 2024, with the majority to take place over the next 24 months. This will increase IHG&#8217;s global system size by up to 1.9% over the coming years.<\/li>\n<li>A total of 52 open and pipeline hotels will join\u00a0IHG through a distinctive collaboration between <i>Holiday Inn<\/i> and <i>the\u00a0niu<\/i>, NOVUM Hospitality&#8217;s stylish, flagship upper midscale brand. This will combine the domestic presence of <i>the niu<\/i> with <i>Holiday Inn&#8217;s<\/i> trusted reputation and global brand recognition to build a leading position in a key target market. NOVUM Hospitality&#8217;s other brands, <i>Yggotel<\/i>, <i>Select<\/i> and <i>Novum<\/i> with 56 open and pipeline hotels will convert to IHG&#8217;s new midscale conversion brand, <i>Garner<\/i>, and the <i>acora Living the City<\/i> brand with 11 open and pipeline hotels will convert to IHG&#8217;s midscale extended stay brand, <i>Candlewood Suites<\/i>.<\/li>\n<li>Under the agreement,\u00a0IHG<span> will receive franchise fees after the phased conversion of existing properties and upon the opening of the hotels under development. Additionally, standard assessments will be received into <\/span>IHG&#8217;s<span> System Fund, including those to cover the operation of <\/span>IHG<span> One Rewards, and marketing and reservation services. <\/span>IHG<span> will contribute key money capital expenditure that will reflect the phased conversion and timing of openings of this major portfolio of hotels.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>The agreement includes an exclusivity arrangement for future NOVUM<span> Hospitality hotels to join <\/span>IHG&#8217;s<span> leading brands and enterprise system, with an ambition to jointly develop further hotels over time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>The agreement has a term of 30 years and the option to renew for additional terms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A total of 111 NOVUM Hospitality properties are in <span class=\"xn-location\">Germany<\/span>, with the remaining eight in <span class=\"xn-location\">Austria<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">the Netherlands<\/span> and the UK. <span class=\"xn-location\">Germany<\/span> is one of <span class=\"xn-location\">Europe&#8217;s<\/span> largest hotel markets, with strong domestic consumption, inbound and outbound travel. In 2022, there were over 450 million overnight stays in <span class=\"xn-location\">Germany<\/span>, the second highest in <span class=\"xn-location\">Europe<\/span>, and the country generated the highest number of international outbound travellers globally, around 100 million.<\/p>\n<p>IHG&#8217;s growth in <span class=\"xn-location\">Germany<\/span> will be supported by continued investment in building localised commercial platforms, such as the recent introduction of loyalty partnerships and improved booking systems. IHG expects its increased scale to bring significant benefits to NOVUM Hospitality and other IHG owners, including higher brand awareness, direct bookings and loyalty engagement, to capture both domestic demand and German outbound business. It will also drive the development of IHG&#8217;s brands across more locations.<\/p>\n<p>NOVUM Hospitality will adopt IHG brands and systems for this entire portfolio, becoming one of IHG&#8217;s largest franchisees globally, with access to IHG&#8217;s powerful commercial engine and technology platforms to drive hotel performance, efficient hotel operations and customer experience.<\/p>\n<p><b><span class=\"xn-person\">Elie Maalouf<\/span><\/b><b>, Chief Executive Officer, IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts, said:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are delighted to collaborate with such a respected group as NOVUM Hospitality and double IHG&#8217;s presence in <span class=\"xn-location\">Germany<\/span>, one of <span class=\"xn-location\">Europe&#8217;s<\/span> largest hotel markets and a growth priority for our business. This agreement demonstrates the appeal to owners of our powerful enterprise and IHG&#8217;s success in attracting excellent conversion opportunities to grow our system size.
