BetMGM has based forward-looking statements on management&#8217;s current expectations, assumptions and projections about future events and trends. Examples of these statements include, but are not limited to, BetMGM&#8217;s expectations regarding its financial outlook (including forecasted net revenues from operations, EBITDA, and expected investment by Entain and MGM Resorts in 2024), projected market share position, its expected growth in new and existing jurisdictions, product capabilities, and achievement of key milestones. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, conditions or results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Included among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements are: the significant competition within the gaming and entertainment industry; BetMGM&#8217;s ability to execute on its business plan; changes in applicable laws or regulations, particularly with respect to iGaming and online sports <span>betting<\/span>; BetMGM&#8217;s ability to manage growth and access the capital needed to support its growth plans; and BetMGM&#8217;s ability to obtain the required licenses, permits and other approvals necessary to grow in existing and new jurisdictions. In providing forward-looking statements, BetMGM is not undertaking any duty or obligation to update these statements publicly as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. If BetMGM updates one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that it will make additional updates with respect to those other forward-looking statements.<\/p>\n<p><b><u>Non-GAAP Financial Information<br class=\"dnr\"><\/u><\/b>This press release includes net revenue from operations, which has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. BetMGM believes this presentation, which it uses for its own analysis of operations, is useful in that it reflects the true economic performance of the business. If BetMGM presented net revenue from operations in accordance with GAAP, then BetMGM would present the revenues associated with its <span class=\"xn-location\">Nevada<\/span> digital and retail sports <span>betting<\/span> operations differently, until such time as BetMGM is licensed as a <span class=\"xn-location\">Nevada<\/span> gaming operator. Currently under GAAP, its calculation of Net Revenue would be on a basis net of operating costs, such that the GAAP reported Net Revenue would be lower than the Net Revenue reported herein, with Net Income remaining the same.<\/p>\n<p><b><u>About BetMGM<br class=\"dnr\"><\/u><\/b>BetMGM is a market-leading sports <span>betting<\/span> and gaming entertainment company, pioneering the online gaming industry.
