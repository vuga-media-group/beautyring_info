Also, it is crucial for businesses to make themselves stand out when compared to their competitors to strengthen their market positions.<\/p>\n<p>Outdoor signage can be a differentiator when a customer has to decide between the two brands. A unique outdoor store signage can draw the customer\u2019s attention from a distance and increase the number of customers entering the store.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, the cost of effectiveness and return on investment of outdoor signages is comparatively higher than the in-store signages as they target multiple demographics. Also, with a wide variety of signage available, the business owners can easily find signage that best suits their budget.<\/p>\n<p>Promotional outdoor signages help the brands to be noticed by new customers. A good signage may encourage the customer to enter the store. Thus, this segment is expected to create a significant incremental opportunity in the years to come.<\/p>\n<p>Multiple retail stores leverage signages as a marketing opportunity to enhance the overall shopping experience of the customers. Store owners use signages to contribute to the atmosphere of the stores. Further, outdoor store signages lead to impulsive buying behaviours. For instance, a signage communicating about the offers and discounts on the products available in the store have the ability to create an impulse buying behaviour.<\/p>\n<p>Store signages let the customers know about the upcoming events like sale, in-store appearances, etc. This enhances the recall and retention rate amongst the customers, which has a significant impact on the revenue stream of a brand. Moreover, digital intervention has eased the process of putting up signages. Digital signages allow the store owners to display an array of content that can be timed and changed automatically with minimum efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Signage manufacturers are witnessing a shift from the print signage to the digital signage. Print signage manufacturers have understanding of the effective information display and the communication element required to be showcased on the signages.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, inclination from traditional signage to digital signage gives a chance to the manufacturers to leverage the customer base. This provides the signage manufacturers the opportunity to expand their business using research and development followed by new production methods.<\/p>\n<p>Traditional signage is slowly losing grounds owing to lack of agility and high initial costs. Whereas, digital signage personalizes experiences along with providing real time feedback to the customers. Further demand for customized noise, colour contrast, connectivity, and resolution makes digital signages an apt marketing tool for businesses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Segments Covered in the Signage Industry Survey Report<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>By Product Type:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">In-store Signage\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Promotional Signage<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Directional Signage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Outdoor Signage\n<ul type=\"circle\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Promotional Signage<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Directional Signage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>By End User:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Supermarkets &amp; Hypermarkets<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Stores<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Schools &amp; Offices<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Industrial Sectors<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Entertainment<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Other End User Verticals<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>By Region:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">North America<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Latin America<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Europe<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">East Asia<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">South Asia and Pacific<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Middle East and Africa (MEA)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Preview Report! <\/strong><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=x3lekfZn4U83k_MvckwSUYVu8N9G8Jem1sG0pI-V72bHDv_hClczlrM5U5gjvCEDcdrEKm9s9GBgV_yoJWLrxGoq_EQyA0bKsPvRth9Iy8L84B9kFg1EgYm5ZoGfRvYvE5nfXTAk8iYdhgCHAsjzEtYRkJ3dic1XxUGqI1psOzUTBc1uG52MUFXs8ST9Pl30\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.futuremarketinsights.com\/reports\/signage-market<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Authored by:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=V38_t8UaESyARuA8pYjPTCUYqexFS-TCbYj6xHLtmwLrdRtbVw3EyStrkRZMxp0HNW9eNURvxpd8J4TSc7TSq_9Q2m3KYpmmhoX-DFQWtr4xePfkpg5hxmznJVdwzCIx\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Ismail Sutaria<\/a>\u00a0(Lead Consultant, Packaging and Materials) has over 8 years of experience in market research and consulting in the packaging &amp; materials industry.
