During the pandemic, as the new coronavirus spread, businesses around the world were gradually flattening their recessionary curves by utilizing digital technology. In addition, schools and colleges have been replaced by online learning because of the closure of educational institutions.

Furthermore, governments throughout the world are taking a variety of measures to encourage the adoption of digital technology in the education sector, which is estimated to unlock lucrative opportunities for market growth in the forecast period. However, with the advent of massively open online courses, open-source platforms such as Apache HTTP Server, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and others is anticipated to deter the market\u2019s growth.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The report segments the global digital educational publishing market into product type, end user, and region.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Digital <\/b><b>T<\/b><b>extbooks Sub-Segment to Grab a Foremost Share of the Market\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The digital textbooks sub-segment of the product segment is foreseen to observe leading growth in the forecast period.
