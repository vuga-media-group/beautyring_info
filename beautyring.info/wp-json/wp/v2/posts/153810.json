Local author and esteemed member, Arpan V. Shah, has written a heartwarming children\u2019s book titled &#8220;<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Daddy-Goes-Work-Baby-Savannah\/dp\/B09QFG4ZTN\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Daddy Goes to Work<\/a>.&#8221; Designed to ease separation anxiety in young children when their fathers leave for work, the book has garnered significant attention and praise.<\/p>\n<p>Shah said: &#8220;My efforts to both write and distribute my book have been hindered by the financial strain of an ongoing, emotionally taxing custody battle. The book itself though is a labor of love and I believe it can help young children understand why their fathers aren&#8217;t home when at work&#8221; Recognizing Shah\u2019s dedication and the book\u2019s positive impact, the Wilmette Park Freemasons have stepped in to support his mission. Through the generosity of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/ilmason.org\/locator\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Lodge<\/a> Vice President, James Dobbs, numerous copies of &#8220;Daddy Goes to Work&#8221; have been donated to various institutions, including the Head Start program in Rogers Park.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This book, &#8220;Daddy Goes to Work&#8221;, addresses a critical aspect of emotional development, fostering a sense of connection between children and their fathers. As both a father and a fellow Mason I felt it was my duty to see that this book made it to children in our community while supporting my friend and Masonic Brother Arpan.&#8221; Said James Dobbs<\/p>\n<p>Studies have shown that a strong bond with one\u2019s father can significantly enhance a child\u2019s happiness and self-confidence. Despite bureaucratic challenges in distributing the book to public schools and libraries, Shah remains resolute, relying on the support of his community and the Freemasons.<\/p>\n<p>The Head Start program, moved by the book\u2019s rave reviews, requested donations for their classrooms. Shah\u2019s generosity was met with immense gratitude from the staff, and the program\u2019s directors allocated funds to purchase additional copies for their Father\u2019s Day event. This initiative, facilitated by the Wilmette Park Freemasons, underscores the lodge\u2019s longstanding tradition of supporting both its members and the community.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Daddy Goes to Work&#8221; is available for purchase on Amazon and directly from the author at arpanshah1202@yahoo.com. <\/p>\n<p>Shah\u2019s outreach efforts included a memorable visit to Walt Disney Magnet School in the Uptown-Buena Park neighborhood of Chicago. During this visit, he engaged with a first-grade classroom, answering students\u2019 questions and sharing his journey as an author, leaving a lasting impression on the young students.<\/p>\n<p>Arpan V. Shah and the Wilmette Freemason Lodge remain eager to collaborate with schools and organizations interested in his book or author readings. His dedication to enriching children\u2019s lives through literature continues to inspire and uplift the community.
