I\u2019m sharing my story to heal myself and to help heal others who may find some solace by reading my story and, perhaps, by sharing theirs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unlike salacious tales and tabloid headlines describing multiple incidents of horrific sexual abuse at the hands of priests, My Fathers is, ultimately, a story of hope born out of Prazych\u2019s desire for understanding and healing. <\/p>\n<p>Clear, respectful and virtually profanity-free, My Fathers will strike a personal chord with survivors of sexual abuse, their parents or guardians, and anyone appalled by the behaviors of predatory priests and the protection they\u2019ve received in the past from the Catholic Church.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s never too late to \u2018say something,\u2019 share your secret, help stop abusers, get justice where possible and make everyone aware so no one else, especially children, have to suffer sexual abuse and trauma,\u201d Prazych added.<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<br \/>Len Prazych has been a professional writer for most of his adult life, first as a freelancer, then as owner of his public relations, marketing and advertising company, then as editor-in-chief of a weekly trade magazine. He enjoyed a non-traditional education, earning both his undergraduate and graduate degrees from Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology at age 35, then his master\u2019s degree at 45 in the Psychology of Narrative, during which he researched and experienced the remarkable power of writing to heal physically and emotionally. Prazych\u2019s thesis on writing therapy helped him through his divorce at age 47, as well as the experience he had when he was 11, which he shares in My Fathers: Letters of Healing on a Quest for the Truth, his first book. Born and raised in New Jersey, he now lives in upstate New York. <\/p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/lenprazych.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/lenprazych.com\/<\/a>, or connect with him on Facebook (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LenPrazych.Author\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LenPrazych.Author<\/a>) or Instagram (@lenprazych).<\/p>\n<p>Amazon link: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/My-Fathers-Letters-Healing-Quest\/dp\/B0CJSVTH1Z\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/My-Fathers-Letters-Healing-Quest\/dp\/B0CJSVTH1Z\/<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>My Fathers: Letters of Healing on a Quest for the Truth<br \/>ISBN-10: \u200e1962204804 <br \/>ISBN-13: \u200e978-1962204804 <br \/>Available from Amazon.com, BN.com and IngramSpark.com <\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Trish Stevens<br \/>Ascot Media Group, Inc.<br \/>+1 832-334-2733<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/717919560\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AscotMediaGroup\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AscotMediaGroup\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">X<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/trish-stevens-99728335\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=hpHPxQa9dSbsAtFO&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      June 06, 2024, 20:04 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/717919560\/survivor-of-sexual-assault-seeks-answers-and-healing-in-powerful-new-memoir\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
