With seamless integration to SynXis Central Reservation System as a single source of truth, SynXis Property Hub increases operational efficiency by reducing the time to execute routine tasks and allows hoteliers to access their property from anywhere through cloud-native technology.<\/p>\n<p>In a landmark achievement that showcases the decade-long partnership between the two companies, Sabre and Wyndham teams successfully migrated more than 5,000 Wyndham hotels to SynXis Property Hub, including the transition of 550 in a single record-breaking month, nearly one year ahead of schedule.<\/p>\n<p>This early completion is complemented by the migration&#8217;s efficiency, which reduced the expected transition downtime for the Wyndham properties by 34%, ensuring successful management of day-to-day operations. This milestone not only highlights an innovative leap, but also sets a new industry standard for large-scale technology migrations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Completing this migration nearly a year ahead of schedule is a testament to the power of\u00a0innovation and collaboration,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Scott Strickland<\/span>, Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) of Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts. &#8220;Through our work with Sabre, thousands of Wyndham hotels now benefit from groundbreaking efficiencies, further enhancing their ability to serve guests and deliver great experiences day-in and day-out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Strickland highlighted some of the immediate benefits of this migration for Wyndham properties and their daily operations. &#8220;For instance, service desk interactions have decreased by 50% compared to the legacy system after just 30 days of adoption. Additionally, by equipping our housekeeping with mobile solutions, we&#8217;ve increased clean room availability for guests by up to 15%. We&#8217;ve also streamlined the reservation delivery and modification process by integrating a single source of inventory that combines Channel Reservations and Property Management Systems. This not only improves guest experiences but also reduces IT support burdens,&#8221; he explained.<\/p>\n<p>The extraordinary success of the project was made possible by several strategic initiatives and the deep collaboration between Sabre and Wyndham. Key initiatives included a major upgrade in system infrastructure that expanded daily migration capacity from 15 to 35 properties. Additionally, the introduction of a new process for discrepancy reporting eliminated the need for preliminary dry runs, thereby speeding up the process and reducing potential downtimes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This project was about much more than just technical migration; it was about transforming the operational backbone of thousands of hotel properties to better meet the needs of today&#8217;s hospitality market,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Gene Guhne<\/span>, SVP &amp; Global Managing Director, Enterprise Sales at Sabre Hospitality. &#8220;The scale of what we&#8217;ve achieved\u2014in terms of both numbers and the speed of implementation\u2014sets a new benchmark for the industry.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>About Sabre Corporation<\/b>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br class=\"dnr\">Sabre Corporation is a leading software and technology company that powers the global travel industry, serving a wide range of travel companies including airlines, hoteliers, travel agencies and other suppliers.
