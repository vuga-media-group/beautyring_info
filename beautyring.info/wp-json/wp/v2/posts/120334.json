Undiagnosed high cholesterol or high blood pressure can lead to kidney disorders, heart attack, or a debilitating stroke,\u201d says Dr. Segal.<\/p>\n<p>Experts underscore Dr. Segal\u2019s comments. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAuthors of a study published in a 2020 issue of the BMJ Public Health journal determined that even a four-week delay in treating cancer following testing and diagnosis is associated with increased mortality from seven cancer types, including breast, colon, lung, and cervix (bit.ly\/43ui3Dz). An online Consumers Report article contends \u201cscreenings done at the right age and frequency can cut the risk of colorectal cancer death by as much as half, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS),\u201d while a blood pressure test for early detection and treatment of hypertension might reduce the incidence of heart attack and stroke by more than 20 percent (bit.ly\/4199i0b).<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Segal offers that people delay medical testing for many reasons. Some are simply afraid of doctors and medical tests and the potential of being diagnosed with a series disease. Others find the red tape to get a script for a test daunting, or don\u2019t have a doctor to write a script in the first place. And some are fearful of the costs. <\/p>\n<p>His understanding of the many reasons why individuals fail to seek timely lab and radiology testing led Dr. Segal to develop LabFinder, an online scheduling platform for laboratory and radiology appointments. The system provides a seamless, stress-free medical experience by connecting patients, doctors, and lab and radiology centers and offering timely test scheduling. It also serves as one central repository for users\u2019 testing results. Most importantly, test results are released simultaneously to patient and clinician and are often available in LabFinder in as little as 24 hours \u2013 a digital feat that puts the service in the vanguard of the \u201ceHealth\u201d revolution.<\/p>\n<p>For those who are without a physician or require a relatively quick consultation, \u201cthere are services to help, such as MinuteMed,\u201d says Dr. Segal. MinuteMed is described as a \u201cvirtual primary care team\u2026of experienced U.S. board-certified physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners\u201d who partner with LabFinder and use telehealth technology to give patients the \u201caccess and answers they need\u2026to make right decisions about their well-being.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMinuteMed is a low-cost service, through which patients can receive physician scripts to undergo specific medical tests. Medical insurance is not required to access this service,\u201d Dr. Segal explains. \u201cOnce patients have their scripts, they can use LabFinder to schedule their screenings,\u201d Dr. Segal explains. <\/p>\n<p>He emphasizes, however, MinuteMed is not a substitute for an acute or emergent problem, does not offer refills of medication prescriptions, and is currently available in only specific regions of the country. <\/p>\n<p>Telehealth programs &#8212; like MinuteMed \u2013 offer a variety of advantages, including easy connection with a physician, \u201cbut the technology should only be used when the occasion warrants. It only supplants, not replaces, face-to-face interaction and in-office physician examination,\u201d Dr. Segal says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhatever the barrier, patients should seek workarounds to get the care and necessary screenings \u2013 such as mammograms and colonoscopies \u2013 that they need,\u201d Dr. Segal says. He offers the following testing tips:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tIf you do not have a regular physician, contact an area hospital, laboratory, walk-in clinic, MinuteMed, or other community resource to inquire about screening services. Some facilities will not require a physician\u2019s order for specific tests. Those that do may have the necessary physicians on site to write you a script for a screening.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tIf costs are an issue or medical insurance is lacking, call the local health department regarding free, low-cost screening programs in the area or LabFinder. And check your potential eligibility for enrolling in a basic health insurance plan.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tIf fear of doctors or doctor offices is the issue, start off with a telehealth program first. Get gradually comfortable with the health professionals you consult until becoming ready to commit to personal interactions in a physician\u2019s office. As for testing results, if they indicate you have a problem, feel relieved. That means you can get treated early and avoid an outcome that may be less than desirable \u2013 or, perhaps, too late.<\/p>\n<p>Bio: Robert Segal MD, board-certified in cardiovascular disease, echocardiography, and nuclear cardiology.
