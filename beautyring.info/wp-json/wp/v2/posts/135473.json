What started as a single hotel in <span class=\"xn-location\">Las Vegas<\/span> has grown into a portfolio of nearly 40 properties, and that is all thanks to our Nobu family: the incredible team behind Nobu Hospitality.<\/i>&#8220;<\/p>\n<p>The evening of celebrations at Nobu Hotel Caesars Palace began with an exclusive reception-style event in Nobu Restaurant &amp; Lounge, where VIP <span>casino<\/span> and retail guests enjoyed special dishes inspired by 10 different Nobu Hotel and Restaurant locations across <span class=\"xn-location\">North America<\/span>. The festivities continued with an intimate after-party in the 10,300-square-foot Nobu Hotel Villa, featuring creative cocktails and desserts and an exclusive performance from ABSINTHE by Spiegelworld. Nobu Hospitality CEO <span class=\"xn-person\">Trevor Horwell<\/span>, Caesars Entertainment executives and the Nobu shareholders took to the stage and toasted 10 years of stirring the hospitality industry on the villa&#8217;s terrace surrounded by unparalleled views of the Las Vegas Strip.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Sean McBurney<\/span>, Regional President of Caesars Entertainment, said: <i>&#8220;At Caesars Palace, we take great pride in our history of &#8216;firsts,&#8217; and we are thrilled to count the first Nobu Hotel in the world among them. Ten years after first opening, Nobu Hotel Caesars Palace remains one of our most sought-after resort experiences. Our incredible partnership here with Nobu Hospitality has paved the way for the addition of Nobu Hotels and Restaurants in other Caesars Rewards destinations, including the upcoming Nobu Hotels in <span class=\"xn-location\">Atlantic City<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">New Orleans<\/span>.&#8221;<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>A Long-Standing Partnership <\/b><\/p>\n<p>Both synonymous with guest satisfaction, unforgettable moments and delivering luxury through experiences, the partnership between Caesars Entertainment and Nobu Hotels has set new standards for hospitality since Nobu Hotel Caesars Palace Las Vegas opened in 2013 \u2013 and it is a partnership that has continued to evolve. The much-anticipated Nobu Hotel Caesars Atlantic City is set to open in <span class=\"xn-chron\">January 2024<\/span>, with a hotel opening within the newly created Caesars New Orleans soon to follow.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Trevor Horwell<\/span>, CEO of Nobu Hospitality, said: &#8220;<i>This anniversary is a testament to the dedication of our team and the loyalty of our guests. We enter all partnerships thinking long term and our collaboration with Caesars is a clear example of this; the trust we&#8217;ve built over the last decade has allowed us to embark on further joint ventures, and <\/i><i>I&#8217;m<\/i><i> excited to see what we&#8217;ll achieve together over the next 10 years. From hotels to branded residences, we are incredibly proud of what Nobu Hotels has accomplished over the past 10 years, and we will continue to provide exceptional experiences for many years to come<\/i>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>Looking Ahead to 2024 <\/b><\/p>\n<p>With the lifestyle draw of luxury developments, a growing number of home buyers are choosing to live in branded communities. Launching in <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Cabos<\/span> in 2023, the first Nobu residences offer an exclusive, curated lifestyle encapsulating the heartfelt hospitality, innovative design, and fine ingredients synonymous with the global lifestyle group. Nobu Hotel, Restaurant and Residences Toronto will follow in 2024, spanning two 45-story towers in the former Pilkington Glass Factory in the city&#8217;s Entertainment District. The project is another ambitious launch for the brand, with 660 residential units and 36 hotel suites, as well as a unique lifestyle space known as Nobu Centre.<\/p>\n<p>Expanding the branded residences is a key part of Nobu&#8217;s continued global expansion, with projects in development in Al Khobar, <span class=\"xn-person\">Al Marjan Island<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Abu Dhabi<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Tulum<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Orlando<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Punta Cana<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Egypt<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Da Nang, Vietnam<\/span>.
