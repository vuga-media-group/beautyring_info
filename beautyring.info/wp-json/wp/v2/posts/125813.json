Education is a catalyst for personal growth, professional development, and social mobility. Access to quality education is a fundamental right, and by embracing DACA students, we hope to pave the way for a more inclusive and equitable society, where everyone &#8211; regardless of their background &#8211; can access education.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Milan Institute accepts Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) students in an effort to be more inclusive and offer even more students this opportunity. By embracing DACA students, Milan Institute hopes to not only promote educational quality but also foster diversity and enrich the learning environment for all students.<\/p>\n<p>Milan Institute is committed to providing career training programs that empower students to gain the education and training they need to move up in life.

Recognizing that language can be a potential barrier, Milan Institute provides translation devices to assist students in overcoming language barriers. These devices serve as valuable tools, enabling students to fully participate in classes, engage with instructors, and grasp course material effectively. <\/p>\n<p>Recognizing that financing education can also be a barrier for students, particularly those who may not qualify for traditional financing such as Federal Financial Aid and grants, Milan Institute has introduced additional financing options to reduce financial limitations that may otherwise hinder the pursuit of education for DACA students. In-house payment plans will enable students to finance their education in a manageable and affordable manner. By providing alternative financing options, Milan Institute hopes to demonstrate its commitment to breaking down barriers and ensuring that education remains accessible to all. <\/p>\n<p>Milan Institute and Milan Institute of Cosmetology specialize in offering career training programs for careers in the fields of beauty, massage therapy, and allied healthcare.
