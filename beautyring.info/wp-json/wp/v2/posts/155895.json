Trying to incorporate the classic sound that older fans miss with the modern sound that newer fans hope for. &#8216;Love&#8217;s Symphony&#8217; is a great combination of both. It not only represents who we were but also who we are. We really are excited about this one and we hope you all are too.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>About &#8220;Grateful&#8221; Sweet added: \u201c&#8217;Grateful&#8217; is an answer to all the fans that have been wanting to hear a throwback to songs like \u201cCalling on You\u201d. It\u2019s a different side of the band musically with a straight ahead, pop\/rock melody and groove. It\u2019s also a message of gratitude and being grateful for what you have, no matter who you are.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>These new singles set the stage for a great year for STRYPER who begin a 40th Anniversary Tour this fall.
