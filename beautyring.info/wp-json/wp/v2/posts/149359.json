These microorganisms, also known as beneficial or healthy bacteria, prevent oral health conditions, bacterial vaginosis, and urinary tract infections. They aid in preventing respiratory infections, enterocolitis, and bowel illnesses. Probiotic ingredients are available in the form of tablets, capsules, powder, and liquid, as well as in fermented foods containing live, active cultures, like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, tempeh, sourdough bread, and kimchi. When consumed as dietary supplements, probiotics colonize the digestive tract with beneficial microorganisms and prevent the overgrowth of harmful bacteria.<\/p>\n<p><b>Download Free Sample Report PDF @\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=8E5fGDG84xyJTnaZks-JIgF_e7YW7zzFnLwq9UXeuerxO_p2hzxsPL9uZqPRomETAQzRxOu2SNVICZQZuQc50cJdm9-HtCtfiRZMrxZbL-_4WulnU4U8jaknnuBNnLYayRTc3gGRNB68cbefdgWnTs6O1ozwcaPDCwkBI9MWkSLx9qSzquDxY-cn8_c-Z8oyv_PQ84WUnPSMCY9nCNsmQMHX7511qpZeNM8aX7pTI4pADXGbC7vDbB8df_FmOYCx\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/probiotic-ingredients-market\/request-sample<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Higher and Diverse Applications in Nutraceuticals Drive the Global Market<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Increasing application in nutraceuticals, such as fortified food and beverage products and dietary supplements, drives the demand for probiotic ingredients. According to data compiled by Packaged Facts, the consumption of probiotic dietary supplements was highest among those aged 18 to 34, indicating a change in their preference toward staying fit and healthy. It can be concluded that, unlike their elders, young Americans do not desire to suffer in old age. Therefore, they are taking precautions to prevent health complications from their youth.<\/p>\n<p>Probiotic supplement makers are profiting from the formulation, application, and therapeutic expansion to other health advantages outside the mainstream to control sales. This is leading to a rise in the use of probiotics in food and beverage products. Consumers are also clamoring for nutritional support from probiotic ingredients as awareness of the significance of gut health increases. Therefore, using probiotics in nutraceuticals is anticipated to stimulate market expansion.<\/p>\n<p><b>Innovations by Key Players Creates Tremendous Opportunities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In the coming years, consumers are anticipated to maintain their interest in probiotic products due to the continued innovation of product offerings and the substantial investment of large food companies in informative advertisements about the consumption of probiotics.

For instance, in April 2022, Pantheyx, a digestive and immune support ingredients company specializing in colostrum, expanded its capabilities to launch probiotic-colostrum combo ingredients for children&#8217;s and adult dietary supplements.<\/p>\n<p>The new formulation includes the strains Bifidobacterium animalis BB-12, Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG+, Lactobacillus plantarum HEAL9, Lactobacillus paracasei 8700:2, and B. subtilis DE111. Through this innovative combination, the company enables dietary supplement manufacturers to create new digestive and immune health duo products. Therefore, it is anticipated that such innovations will facilitate market expansion.<\/p>\n<p><b>Regional Analysis<\/b><\/p>\n<p>EMEA held the highest market share and is estimated to boost at a CAGR of 3.94% during the forecast period. Europe and the Middle East and Africa make up the EMEA region. The probiotic components market in Saudi Arabia experienced significant growth due to the rising demand for dietary supplements to treat illnesses related to intestinal tracts, digestion, and other related conditions. A growing understanding of the relationship between diet and health increases the region&#8217;s demand for probiotic foods and beverages. During the period under review, probiotic-infused dietary supplements became increasingly popular. In addition, key manufacturers have focused on growing their product portfolios to acquire a competitive advantage. For instance, in October 2020, Sanofi added DioraByota to its Dioralyte line of post-diarrhea fluid replacement products, following the release of Buscobiota, two Nootropics supplements that combined the s. boulardii probiotic with dietary fiber and vitamins B6 and B12. This factor is driving up demand for probiotic ingredients throughout the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p><b>Key Highlights<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Based on type, the global probiotic ingredients market is bifurcated into bacteria, yeast, and spore formers.\u00a0The bacteria segment dominates the global market and is projected to exhibit a CAGR of 3.70% over the forecast period.<\/li>\n<li>Based on application, the global probiotic ingredients market is segmented into foods and beverages, dietary supplements, and animal feed.\u00a0The dietary supplements segment owns the highest market share and is estimated to exhibit a CAGR of 7.13% during the forecast period.<\/li>\n<li>EMEA is the most significant global probiotic ingredients market shareholder and is estimated to exhibit a CAGR of 3.94% during the forecast period.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Competitive Players<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The key global probiotic ingredients market players are <em><strong>Kerry Inc., Chr.
