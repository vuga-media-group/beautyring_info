Her only companions are two dogs, abundant wildlife, and the ghost of her father, who died and left the island to her when she was seventeen. During the summer of 2001, she challenges her husband\u2019s claim that her need for solitude renders her strange, recounting stories of many women who have immersed themselves in isolation in order to explore the natural world. McGrath senses that she\u2019s one person while alone on her island, and quite another out in the world. Her island self remains separate from the one who visits her dying mother in a nursing home. While she had always adored her father, taking from him her love for the lake and for the people who\u2019ve made their lives there, she struggles to reconcile those feelings with the way he entered into this wilderness to kill the wild creatures with whom she shares her island home. This leads her to a humbling discovery.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn McGrath has a degree in classics from the University of Iowa and an MA in creative writing from Stony Brook University in New York, where she taught for years in the Department of English and directed the Stony Brook $1000 Short Fiction Prize. She now lives in Charlottesville, Virginia, where, before the pandemic, she taught poetry and developmental English and formed a book club in a high-security prison for women. In 2020, Canada closed the US-Canadian border, causing her to break her record of spending every summer of her life on her island on Bobs Lake.<\/p>\n<p>Interviews available upon request.<\/p>\n<p>Brandylane Publishers, Inc. is an independent press located in Richmond, Virginia, that has published books since 1985.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n___________<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8216;Two Faces of the Moon&#8217; (paperback, 163 pages, $16.95 \/ Kindle e-book $7.99) is available for pre-order from <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Two-Faces-Moon-Island-Memoir\/dp\/1958754331\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=P8GIXL5EYA85&amp;keywords=two+faces+of+the+moon+carolyn+mcgrath&amp;qid=1682090427&amp;sprefix=two+faces+of+the+moon+carolyn+mcgrat%2Caps%2C87&amp;sr=8-1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Amazon<\/a>, Barnes &amp; Noble, and other fine booksellers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">PR Team<br \/>Brandylane Publishers, Inc.<br \/>+1 804-644-3090<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/642618088\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BrandylanePublishers\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brandypublish\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/brandylane-publishers-inc.\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/brandylanepublishers\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=PVZYkRsOlAz_YgbH&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      July 07, 2023, 12:55 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/642618088\/in-two-faces-of-the-moon-a-woman-seeks-meaning-through-nature-solitude-and-endurance-on-an-island-in-canada\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
