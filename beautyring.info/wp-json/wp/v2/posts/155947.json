They wowed the world, turning out to be something that was never before in the world of Olympic sports. <\/p>\n<p>The uniforms were created by NYC apparel brand designer Greg Speirs for the team to have something fun to wear during the Olympics practice before the actual games. Wearing the &#8220;Skullman tie dyes&#8221; energized and inspired the team. The reaction from the international Olympics audience was overwhelming. The players wore the shirts wherever they went after that. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.skullman.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">The public wanted to know where they could get one.<\/a> \u201cThe story became a major news event impacting popular culture, taking its place in Olympics history, had a major influence on the future of sports fashion and changed it forever. The Tie Dyed Slammin<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> Skullman<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> became a legendary household icon.\u201d said Mike Thompson of Slammin Sports<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>.<\/p>\n<p>The story began when Lithuania, one of the Baltic States&#8217; former Soviet Satellite countries, during the time of the Reagan administration, broke from the Soviet Union and gained it&#8217;s newly found independence and freedom. Former Soviet player and then NBA star Sarunas Marciulionis, who was discovered by a coach at the Golden State Warriors, started rallying for donations and support for the new but financially strapped 1992 Lithuanian Olympic Men&#8217;s Basketball team, with hopes of competing for the first time as free nation apart from the Soviet Union in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Marciulionis received various monetary donations, including one from the Grateful Dead musical group. According to news reports, among the various donations the team received the Grateful Dead came into the story with a separate $5,000. donation of their own to Marciulionis, which was the part they played in this story.<\/p>\n<p>New York apparel Licensor Greg Speirs also heard about the team&#8217;s plight and came into this story and independently created the Skullman<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> tie dyed uniforms, just so the team could have something fun to wear during the practice time before the actual Olympic competitions.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSee IMDB bio doc.: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm3998173\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm3998173\/<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nListen to the podcast that uncovered the true facts: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/wondery.com\/shows\/sports-explains-the-world\/episode\/13843-the-skullman-cometh\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/wondery.com\/shows\/sports-explains-the-world\/episode\/13843-the-skullman-cometh\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The team&#8217;s plight was highlighted in the 2012 sports and political documentary film &#8220;The Other Dream Team&#8221;:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDirected and produced by Marius Markevicius and Jon Weinbach, It is about the Lithuanian Olympic basketball team at the 1992 Summer Olympic Games.

It was never an actual team jersey, nor was it ever part of the Grateful Dead. All licensing rights for the property and brand always originated exclusively from the designer.\u201d said Mike Thompson of Slammin&#8217; Sports.<\/p>\n<p>Who is Greg Speirs?:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSpeirs is the former art director who created the rock n\u2019 roll music magazine \u201cGrooves\u201d back in the 1970\u2019s, designed the legendary &#8220;Monaco Monk&#8221; icicle sleds for Prince Albert of Monaco&#8217;s Olympic Monaco Bobsled Team for the Nagano Winter Olympics and World Cup and collaborated in the 1970&#8217;s with famed Woodstock Music Festival founder and record producer Artie Kornfeld, in particular with RCA Records. Artie Kornfeld is the man who coined the phrase &#8220;Far Out&#8221; when he spoke at Woodstock in 1969 and also coined the phrase &#8220;Take it to the Max&#8221; when he produced the record album for the Max Damian band in the 1970&#8217;s, which Greg created the album cover for.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Greg played a much more significant role in the story of the Lithuanian Olympic Basketball Team than was reported initially, reported in 1992, including with respect to the funding of the Lithuanian team. Skewed misreports still being picked up today by major newspapers based on the initial 1992 inaccurate narratives. But the true facts about the source are different.&#8221; recalled Mike Thompson of Slammin&#8217; Sports.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSee CNBC news story:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/amp\/id\/100165621\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/amp\/id\/100165621<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When the Olympics ended and demand for the shirts continued, Greg saw it as a great opportunity to help the team and chose to donate all of what would have been his profits to continue to fund the team. Speirs licensed to the team use of the property to sell shirts for a limited time to raise money for the team and for Marciulionis&#8217; additional charities. That&#8217;s why Greg is called the major sponsor of the 1992 Men&#8217;s Lithuanian Olympic Basketball Team after the Olympics. He donated 100% of his profits to fund the team, which started at $450,000 in the first wave of donations which continued after the Olympics and may have skyrocketed to millions according to news reports. All of Greg&#8217;s profits were given to Lithuanian player Sarunas Marciulionous&#8217; &#8216;Sarunas Lithuanian Children\u2019s Fund&#8221; to help sick children in need, which was set up and controlled by the former Lithuania team player and NBA star who received 100% of all funds with a portion used to fund Marciulionis&#8217; basketball school in Lithuania according to news reports.&#8221; recalled Mike.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In appreciation for his unprecedented contribution to the nation of Lithuania and his generous donation to the team and Lithuanian charity, we believe Greg should have at least received the Medal of the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke or the Commander&#8217;s Grand Cross from the President of Lithuania. We suspect the President didn&#8217;t know that it was Greg\u2019s contribution at the time. Any donation of funds given from the sale of a shirt ultimately came from the artist. It was Greg&#8217;s to give and no one else&#8217;s. But that&#8217;s not the way it was reported. Greg is the Licensor. The documented fact is that after the Olympics ended, it was his money that became the biggest donation to the team, to the Marciulionis Charity and to build Sarunas&#8217; basketball school in Lithuania, because those funds came from the sales of his shirts. Only Greg had the right to release profits to charity or to anyone. As the creator and exclusive Licensor of the property, Greg generously released 100% of his licensing profits to fund the team and Marciulionis\u2019 charities.&#8221; said Mike.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe 1992 Lithuanian Basketball Team represents what happens in freedom\u2026people excel. The Lithuanian Slam-Dunking Skullman<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> represents rising from nothing. Like a Phoenix from the ashes to slam-dunking a flaming basketball. It&#8217;s not a dead skeleton, but the Skullman is alive and represents rebirth and a new life. When you are free you have the opportunity to succeed as an individual while still being part of a team. It was not only a victory in Olympic sports, but it was as if it were an overall triumph over communism itself. It&#8217;s about freedom and free enterprise.&#8221; recalled Speirs. <\/p>\n<p>See IMDB bio:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm3998173\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm3998173\/<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nListen to &#8220;The Other Dream Team&#8221; interview:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.gregspeirs.com\/greg-speirs-audio-interview-by-the-other-dream-team-documentary-film\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http:\/\/www.gregspeirs.com\/greg-speirs-audio-interview-by-the-other-dream-team-documentary-film\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The uniforms were \u201censhrined\u201d in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass. on Dec.7th 1993, below a giant 12ft. x 8ft. 3-D incarnation of the legendary Slam Dunking Skeleton.
