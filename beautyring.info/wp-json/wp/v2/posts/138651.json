Silver is the board president of the Cancer Research and Treatment Fund (CRTF), which is dedicated to funding research focused on the cause, prevention, treatment and cure of MPNs. Under his leadership, the CRTF has directed millions of dollars to support innovative research that may one day improve the lives of people living with MPNs.<\/li>\n<li>Shamim Salman, M.D., who is an MPN Hero for dedicating her years of hematology\/oncology health care expertise to improving the lives of people affected by MPNs.

A clinical nurse manager at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Buxton provides an empathetic and caring ambiance to the busy MPN clinic. He is a constant presence and source of support for all his patients as they navigate their MPN journey.<\/li>\n<li>Nichole Ard is an MPN Hero for her extraordinary leadership and strong patient focus while coordinating MPN clinical trials at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. As a senior clinical studies coordinator, she was nationally recognized as a primary reason for the success of one key clinical study. Nichole finds it extremely satisfying that her efforts may one day contribute to a better life for all people affected by MPNs.<\/li>\n<li>Marilyn Kay Edwards is an MPN Hero for her outreach as an MPN peer with CHAMPN, the Community Voice Champion Program.
