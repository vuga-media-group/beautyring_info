They require reliable energy for basic needs like refrigeration and lighting, which are currently best met by fossil fuels. Koonin criticized international financial institutions for restricting fossil fuel investments in these regions, calling such policies &#8220;immoral&#8221; and politically unfeasible.<\/p>\n<p>Koonin also addressed the Paris Agreement&#8217;s goals, which include eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions in the latter half of the 21st century. Yet, fossil fuels still constitute 80% of the world&#8217;s energy supply. The United Nations says by the year 2030, emissions will be almost double the level that was set by the Paris Agreement.<\/p>\n<p>A more balanced approach is needed, Koonin says, one that includes nuclear energy as a significant component of a zero-emissions future. Wind and solar energy sources cannot meet the growing demand for continuous electricity supply, he argues\u2014especially now that the AI revolution is stoking demand for more electricity.<\/p>\n<p>His insights reflect his extensive background in both academia and industry. Koonin has served as Under Secretary for Science at the U.S. Department of Energy and as Chief Scientist at BP, bringing a wealth of experience to his analysis of climate and energy policies.<\/p>\n<p>The interview with Steven Koonin can be heard on \u201cWhat\u2019s Bugging Me\u201d episode #88, on the Ricochet platform here:<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/ricochet.com\/podcast\/whats-bugging-me\/donald-in-the-lions-den-kamala-stars-in-roots\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/ricochet.com\/podcast\/whats-bugging-me\/donald-in-the-lions-den-kamala-stars-in-roots\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And on Apple Podcasts here: <\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/whats-bugging-me\/id1657007934\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/whats-bugging-me\/id1657007934<\/a><\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">S.
