Longo will be a touchstone for travelers in search of clarity as this small and customized tour moves through Edinburgh, Belfast, Dublin and mystical portals between, visiting storied castles, inns and landmarks \u2013 but with a twist. There will be guides and docents and magical storytellers to spin the histories of these places in not-to-be missed destinations. But traveling with a healer brings new dimensions to this travel experience. Time will be spent looking at realms noted for paranormal activity and meeting notable local intuitives along the way.<\/p>\n<p>Pat Longo has been a sought-out healer and teacher for more than 30 years. She discovered and mentored famed mediums such as Teresa Caputo, MaryAnn DiMarco and Kim Russo to name a few. She came to understand her skills slowly and relatively late in life when, at the age of 40 a mentor helped her understand that the heat she was feeling in her hands was a force that needed to be contained, channeled and used. Working with her gifts she learned they were inherited from a long line of gifted intuitives in her family. Today, she helps others tap into their own inborn gifts and also communicate with guides, forces and loved ones trying to reach them.<\/p>\n<p>Pat Longo\u2019s latest book, \u201cThe Gifts Beneath Your Anxiety,\u201d discusses how to focus and recognize the messages from beyond that need to be heard. In this Travel-in-Spirit tour, guests will not only have the chance to experience the unseen while exploring the sacred places and portals that are key to the lore of Scotland and Ireland, but also enjoy group sessions in the psychic arts and personal readings during this eight-day journey.<\/p>\n<p>Co-hosting the journey is Jenniffer Weigel, Emmy Award winning journalist, author, and storyteller who has been investigating all things paranormal for over two decades. Her popular podcast, \u201cThe Jen Weigel Show,\u201d attracts more than 15,000 downloads per week, and her <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.jenweigel.com\/spiritual-social-club\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">SPIRITUAL SOCIAL CLUB<\/a>\u2013 which meets both in person, and on Zoom, has connected seekers from around the globe with sessions managed by known practitioners in the healing and psychic arts.
