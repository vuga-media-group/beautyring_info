With roots in Suffolk county, we wanted to ensure our family and friends would finally have a safe place to get pierced. Knowing we would be a destination business, we chose the beautiful village of Patchogue so our clients could create treasured memories of their milestone moment by spending the day exploring, dining and having fun about town.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Amulet Arts quickly became well known in the industry, not only due to their piercers\u2019 well established careers but also offering pop-up events in Brooklyn, Dallas, East Hampton, LA, Malibu, Montauk, NYC, Santa Monica and SoHo bringing their services to clients and celebrities coast to coast.<\/p>\n<p>Amulet Arts is proud to be celebrating five years of adorning clients and making friends at 26 E Main Street with performers, a live DJ, giveaways and an after party taking place at Ruta Oaxaca.<\/p>\n<p>June 14th 6:00pm &#8211; 9:00pm, afterparty to follow. Appointments are recommended for those wanting to get pierced although walk-ins will be taken if time allows.
