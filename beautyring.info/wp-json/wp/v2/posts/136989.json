Manufacturers are using advanced materials and technology to create footwear that is durable, comfortable, and able to withstand harsh environments. However, the process of turning skin into leather requires enormous amounts of energy and the use of hazardous chemicals, including formaldehyde, coal tar derivatives, various oils, dyes, and finishes, some of which are cyanide-based. This is true even though some leather manufacturers falsely promote their products as environmentally friendly. As a result, the manufacturing of tactical footwear has a negative impact on the environment, which inhibits market expansion. In addition, due to the restricted presence of the dominant, diversified players in the tactical footwear market, stakeholders are preparing to invest in and grow their companies through product innovation.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Report Coverage &amp;

Hence, this segment is expected to exhibit considerable growth rate during the forecast period. However, shoes segment is also expected to be the fastest-growing segment and is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 6.8% from 2023 to 2032. Shoes serve as the most crucial component of a person&#8217;s apparel, as no other piece of products must fit perfectly and fulfil critical mechanical tasks such as transferring body weight. They are comfortable to wear, as they are light in weight as compared to boots. However, in case of tactical footwear, boots are preferred more due to their wide application.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Procure Complete Report (<\/b><b>289<\/b><b> Pages PDF with Insights, Charts, Tables, and Figures) @<\/b>\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=fEvb-ZozXJG5sEI6U-SaSNh2zU_LpmaUUUSQQZ53F43Gk-1KBpVAqJNasxxSJ1H4jpvD2ni9_BJhpJ4OzANbPBXKarfFot01U2Cs7HLAOF0wyZi5bgwK8KpRFiP6XtZF_oz4-KukaamypAsdYyTLsDr_55NPy4koiLNJj3UDMhWteRw00rgFB7Kq1_wu51nybwF12bU-Rgq5gmW7UocL1pzb6WBXA_v6Nj8TYf4GKdMb8ieJ-hNsPuyGIF34fcS1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/checkout-final\/2fb1ae0585a0391f6e6c3d8dd5d3c03d<\/b><\/a><b>\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>The <\/b><b>men<\/b><b> segment to <\/b><b>maintain<\/b><b> its lead position throughout the forecast period<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">Based on end use, the men segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for more than four-fifth of the global tactical footwears market revenue and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period.
