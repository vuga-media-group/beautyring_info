The research, conducted by various sources, highlights the alarming statistic that women-led start-ups receive <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2023\/02\/for-female-founders-only-fundraising-from-female-vcs-comes-at-a-cost\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">less than 3% of all VC investments.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The data reveals a decline in VC funding for female founders in recent years. In 2020, only <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2021\/02\/women-led-startups-received-just-2-3-of-vc-funding-in-2020\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">2.3% of VC funding<\/a> went to women-led start-ups, a decrease from the previous year&#8217;s 2.8%. This persistent underinvestment in women-led ventures poses significant challenges for female entrepreneurs striving to launch and grow their businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Several factors contribute to this funding disparity. One factor is the lack of gender diversity within the VC industry itself, with only approximately 12% of decision-makers at VC firms being women. Furthermore, research suggests that investors often stick to their existing networks, which tend to be male-dominated and favour tech companies led by men.<\/p>\n<p>We spoke with Claire Kettell, founder of renowned beauty and hairdresser salon supplier <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/salonserve.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">SalonServe<\/a>, established in 1994, for her views. She told us:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDespite the progress that has been made, the beauty industry still operates within a broader societal context where gender biases and inequalities persist and need to respond proactively. This entails fostering an environment that encourages and supports investment in women-led start-ups and investing in initiatives that prioritise inclusivity.\u201c<\/p>\n<p>The consequences of this funding gap are far-reaching. Beyond the financial implications, it affects the overall job market for women and hinders efforts to address gender inequality. Women-led start-ups have been found to employ more women, contributing to a more diverse and inclusive workforce. Moreover, research indicates that women-led businesses deliver higher revenue per dollar invested and often have a strong focus on making a social contribution and building positive employee relationships.<\/p>\n<p>To address this persistent issue, industry leaders, policymakers, and investors must take conscious steps to increase funding for women-led start-ups and promote gender diversity within the VC ecosystem. Initiatives that foster mentorship, provide access to resources and promote networking opportunities for female entrepreneurs can play a crucial role in bridging the funding gap.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Claire Kettell, Founder <br \/>SalonServe<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/654137497\/mailto:info@salonserve.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">info@salonserve.com<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/salonserve\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Salonserve\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/salonserve\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=fipd-2gjIuCpVUsX&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      September 07, 2023, 09:30 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/654137497\/recent-research-reveals-less-than-3-of-venture-capital-investments-allocated-to-women-led-ventures\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
