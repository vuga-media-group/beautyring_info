He distills his decades of experience into the 10 characteristics of high-potential employees in his latest book, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Fast-Starting-Career-Consequence-Christ-Centered-Re-entering\/dp\/1631953583\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=20TE4OQK7WP3F&amp;keywords=Fast-Starting+a+Career+of+Consequence&amp;qid=1687794366&amp;sprefix=fast-starting+a+career+of+consequence%2Caps%2C378&amp;sr=8-1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Fast-Starting a Career of Consequence<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis book will arm you with advice that will enable you to quickly become noticed and recognized as a high-potential employee who is capable and ready for future advancement and expanded levels of responsibility,\u201d Sievert writes in the book.<\/p>\n<p>In Fast-Starting a Career of Consequence, Sievert elaborates on 10 practical and proven strategies that individuals can implement immediately to gain visibility and early success as they enter the workforce for the first time, move to a new company or re-enter the workforce after a period of absence. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe advice applies equally well to small or large corporations and to entrepreneurial ventures,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe book was inspired by a request for advice from my daughter on how to be identified as a high potential employee and advance her career as she languished in an entry-level position at her large global company. The advice proved to be very effective as she was rapidly promoted into positions with greater levels of responsibility.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Chapters explore universal career-relevant topics such as: Demonstrating Commitment; Embracing the Company\u2019s Vision and Mission; Developing Cultural and Organizational Awareness; Understanding the Financial Underpinnings of the Business; Demonstrating Strategic Thinking Capability; Over-preparing for Every Meeting; Making Every Presentation a Command Performance; and Balancing Faith, Family and Career.<\/p>\n<p>Sievert drew upon his unique combination of experiences as a Christian executive, a mentor and a college instructor to develop a book packed with practical Christ-centered advice for those wishing to add a spiritual dimension to career pursuits. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cDuring my career, and afterward, I mentored many young employees and executives \u2014 at least 10 of whom went on to become presidents or CEOs of their organizations,\u201d Sievert explained.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Sievert hopes to show others the value of nurturing a symbiotic relationship between faith and career.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSince most of us will spend more than half of our waking hours at work, I really felt it was important to talk about ways in which you can bring and follow biblical principles in the workplace, and at the same time, get some really valuable business tips from a guy who\u2019s been there,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<br \/>Raised in a lower-middle-class family that only occasionally spoke of God, Fred Sievert received an unexpected visit from God when he was 12. Despite his subsequent experiences as an adult, transitioning from a math teacher to the president of a Fortune 100 company \u2014 a journey driven by an aggressive pursuit of the American dream \u2014 his habit of thoughtful reflection and his spiritual longing from that one encounter in boyhood informed his decisions for the rest of his life. <\/p>\n<p>In retirement, Sievert\u2019s overwhelming passion is to positively impact the lives of others by writing and speaking about his faith and his business experience. <\/p>\n<p>Sievert\u2019s articles have appeared on MarketWatch.com, the Fox Business Blog and in The Guideposts Magazine. He has been featured by many major television and radio channels, including Fox News, Fox Business, Daystar Global TV and NBC. The 700 Club produced feature videos from two of the stories in his book, Grace Revealed. <\/p>\n<p>For more information, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.StoriesOfGodsGrace.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.StoriesOfGodsGrace.com<\/a>; follow the author on Facebook (fredsiev1) or Twitter (@FJSievert); or connect with him on LinkedIn (fred-sievert-9121727).<\/p>\n<p>Amazon link: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Fast-Starting-Career-Consequence-Christ-Centered-Re-entering\/dp\/1631953583\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Fast-Starting-Career-Consequence-Christ-Centered-Re-entering\/dp\/1631953583\/<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>Fast-Starting a Career of Consequence: Practical Christ-Centered Advice for Entering or Re-entering the Workforce<br \/>Publisher: Morgan James<br \/>ISBN-10: \u200e1631953583 <br \/>ISBN-13: \u200e978-1631953583 <br \/>Available from Amazon.com, BN.com and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.StoriesOfGodsGrace.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.StoriesOfGodsGrace.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Trish Stevens<br \/>Ascot Media Group, Inc.<br \/>+1 832-334-2733<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/641564965\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AscotMediaGroup\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AscotMediaGroup\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/trish-stevens-99728335\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=qWOFK1cEkzPiJrRd&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      June 26, 2023, 21:07 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/641564965\/former-fortune-100-president-shares-10-uncommon-insights-to-help-employees-get-noticed\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
