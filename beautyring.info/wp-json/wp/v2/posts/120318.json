Attendees will have the opportunity to meet the Wine To Water founder and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=w11gpTwXqYk\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">CNN Hero<\/a>, Doc Hendley. <\/p>\n<p>The event will be held Tuesday, May 16 from 6 to 8 p.m. at Studio Movie Grill, 452 Lincoln Square in Arlington. The evening will include a Q&amp;A with Hendley, three volunteers whose experience is depicted in the film, and Texas Agriculture Commissioner, Sid Miller. Miller will provide his input on how water issues are affecting Texas communities.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe purposely selected Texas as their commitment to the environment and Earth Day are evident with events like EarthX,\u201d said Hendley. \u201cWe are pleased to host this groundbreaking premiere event in the heart of Texas.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Founded in 2004, WTW has made an impact all over the world developing hygiene practices in schools, digging wells for villages, and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wtw.org\/filter-build-event\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">providing water filters<\/a> to families in need. These families often walk miles a day just to bring water to their homes.

The theme \u201cbeyond water\u201d reinforces integrated water and sanitation initiatives which are key for creating impacts that lead to transformational change. Water is only the beginning \u2013 clean water leads to economic sustainability, education, women\u2019s empowerment, healthcare, and economic growth. <\/p>\n<p>WTW action in the U.S. is also a vital part of their work. Often this work consists of providing disaster relief; their most recent efforts in the U.S. include Southwest Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. They also provided boots on the ground in Jackson, MS for emergency aid and a recycling program to minimize the impact of millions of water bottles being brought into a community. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur goal in creating this documentary is to bring awareness to the global water crisis and to stress how important donations and volunteerism are to continue supporting communities on every continent,\u201d added Hendley.<\/p>\n<p>The trailer for the Wine To Water documentary can be viewed at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wtw.org\/beyondwater\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.wtw.org\/beyondwater<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To attend the private premiere event and support Beyond Water: The Documentary, reach out to info@bpr.international.
