To make the commercial building livelier and create more appealing spaces that would otherwise seem dull, green wall vertical gardens are typically put in commercial buildings at receptions, corridors, waiting rooms, hotel rooms, and other locations. Therefore, it is projected that expansion in the commercial building industry will benefit this sector. On the other hand, green facade vertical<\/p>\n<p>garden segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 11.0% from 2023 to 2032. This is attributed to the ability of green facade vertical gardens to improve a building&#8217;s appearance by covering it with lush and colorful flora. The resulting green layer works as insulation, preventing direct sunlight from heating the walls and keeping the structure&#8217;s interior cool.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The commercial segment to maintain its lead position during the forecast period<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Based on application, the commercial segment accounted for the largest share in 2022, contributing to more than three-fifths of the global vertical garden construction market revenue, and is projected to maintain its lead position during the forecast period. An increase in urbanization, a rise in the and working-class population are playing an instrumental role in driving the number of commercial buildings. However, the residential segment is expected to portray the largest CAGR of 9.3% from 2023 to 2032. The residential segment is anticipated to grow owing to the increasing population and reduction in the cost of vertical gardens that make them more affordable to the common man.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Asia-Pacific to maintain its dominance by 2032<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Based on region, Asia-Pacific held the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2022, accounting for nearly half of the global vertical garden construction market revenue, and is likely to dominate the market during the forecast period. Moreover, the same region is expected to witness the fastest CAGR of 9.6% from 2023 to 2032. This expansion is attributed to rapid economic growth, population growth, and the rise of tourism in countries such as China, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. In addition, the rising trend of living with nature is also a major driving factor for the growth of the vertical garden construction market. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Enquire Before Buying: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=pQJnE3lH8KvcE4hdyQtTXgUtIGV5itfELwxeWx5gmL8oKNYh_fDVBHAvx-7hBHtQddJ-ckPjPxz68SfaRGbxDdXVog68EGrp2DgWdJnHMf9eBYvd43TspHg-finAIYeJi4JZ71Q-q1wWaKrfdyfAzrTKKPqKUoi6be3nq6HgEdipmz-Z8myc2iSKvbLSAwBD\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/purchase-enquiry\/4249<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Leading Market Players: &#8211;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 ANS Group Global Ltd.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Atlantis Corporation Australia Pty Ltd<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Biotecture Limited<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Elmich Pte Ltd<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Four Leaf Landscape and Civiltech Pvt Ltd.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Fytogreen Australia<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 LiveWall, LLC<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 PAISAJISMO URBANO<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 Sempergreen BV<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7 ZTC International Landscape Solutions (P) Ltd.<\/p>\n<p>The report provides a detailed analysis of these key players in the global vertical garden construction market.
