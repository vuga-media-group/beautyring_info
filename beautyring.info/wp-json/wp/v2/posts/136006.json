The standard motorcycle requires less fuel in comparison with other bikes (Cruiser and Sports) and are easy to ride and control. Moreover, the sports motorcycle segment is estimated to showcase the fastest growth with 10.2% CAGR during the forecast period, due to several developments and innovations among sports bikes for consumers across medium to high-income group. <\/p>\n<p><b>The internal combustion engine (ICE) segment to lead the trail during the forecast period<\/b><\/p>\n<p>On the basis of propulsion type, the internal combustion engine (ICE) segment garnered the major share in 2021, contributing to nearly 90% of the overall market revenue and is expected to continue its supremacy from 2022 to 2031. The growth is attributed to the technological advancements in IC engines with simpler components and surging incorporation of ICEs along with fuel-efficient systems. On the other hand, the electric segment would cite the fastest growth with 13.1% CAGR during the forecast period, due to strict government norms for vehicle emissions and robust demand for low emission, high performance, and fuel-efficient vehicles. <\/p>\n<p><b>Procure Complete Research Report (PDF\/ Excel with Qualitative and Quotative Data, Insights, Statistics, Tables, Charts, Figures) <\/b>&#8211; <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=VB5Ygj7qwDkFiTeS6kXPjPcnIrmMI2aqf8EPt6pJpjXOJIWIbz9-19SfW4Ye0RetK35ggAyy0KhpTUPuTLM7U-SE4JGO_BC_-9UkmI2X9oJNP5xHClnJ_LRJEPrLOtR4F-SLttXrV-tWUcc2ZoIZKNHDEWU9uwhVGjG0kzOAPok8UrXHI-sGQISYA6o6zokd4O0YfGZV2NwWjyWzLA4TVzXQIoOhOEf0KQQN5O91c3w=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/motorcycle-market\/purchase-options<\/u><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>The mid segment to rule the roost during the forecast period<\/b><\/p>\n<p>On the basis of price range, the mid segment held the largest share in 2021, accounting for more than one-third of the total market revenue and is estimated to lead the trail from 2022 to 2031.
