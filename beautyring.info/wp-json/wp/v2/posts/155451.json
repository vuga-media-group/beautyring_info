However, these letters do not and cannot bring about cancellation. Instead, the letters are intended to mislead customers to believe that TDA is &#8220;negotiating&#8221; with Capital Vacations and will be effectuating a cancellation. Meanwhile, TDA instructs customers to stop making payments on their timeshare, knowing that Capital Vacations has not agreed to any cancellation, that the non-payment will result in damage to the customer&#8217;s credit, and that the customer will eventually face a loan default \u2014 all while TDA lines its pockets with the exorbitant fees it charged for the charade of legal services.<\/p>\n<p id=\"continue-jump\">\n<p>Capital Vacations&#8217; lawsuit also states that TDA uses a slew of other deceptive and unfair trade practices, all of which harm customers and Capital Vacations, to enrich themselves.<\/p>\n<p><b>ABOUT CAPITAL VACATIONS<sup>\u00ae<\/sup><\/b><br class=\"dnr\">Capital Vacations is reimagining the travel experience by connecting Independent Resorts with travelers through our technology platform and vacation products.
