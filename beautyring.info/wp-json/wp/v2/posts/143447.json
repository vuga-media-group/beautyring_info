Leanpath&#8217;s analytics platform identifies high-impact opportunities for food waste reduction and sets automated goals to break a large food waste problem into manageable wins. Most kitchens cut their food waste in half with Leanpath within a year, leading to significant financial and environmental savings.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Leanpath data is priceless,&#8221; says Venegas. &#8220;It helps us understand where to focus our efforts in reducing food waste and it keeps the team more conscious about controlling waste as a part of the kitchen culture.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One-third of the world&#8217;s food production goes to waste every year, with a quarter of that waste coming from the foodservice industry, according to the United Nations. The financial cost of this waste is estimated at <span class=\"xn-money\">$1 trillion<\/span> annually. If food waste were a country, it would rank third in greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p>\n<p>Venegas and his team&#8217;s efforts have not gone unnoticed. In <span class=\"xn-chron\">April 2023<\/span>, Marriott International launched the Food Waste Reduction Rally to encourage sites to share their food waste data and best practices in reducing food waste. Costa Rica Marriott Hacienda Belen was recognized as the leader in food waste reduction for the <span class=\"xn-location\">Caribbean<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Latin America<\/span> region.<\/p>\n<p><b>ABOUT LEANPATH<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Leanpath, a Certified B-Corp, is on a mission to make food waste prevention and measurement everyday practice in the world&#8217;s kitchens. With customers in over 45 countries, Leanpath&#8217;s solution identifies root causes of food waste and changes behaviors that lead to that waste. Since 2004, Leanpath and its foodservice partners have prevented 100 million pounds of food from going to waste, an average of 50 percent reduction per kitchen. Leanpath has offices in Portland,\u00a0London\u00a0and\u00a0Shanghai.<\/p>\n<p>Media Contact:<br class=\"dnr\"><span class=\"xn-person\">Sam Smith<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">503-828-9903<br class=\"dnr\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection#5063676268696810353d31393c6420227e333f3d\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"7b484c494342433b1e161a12174f0b0955181416\">[email\u00a0protected]<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p>SOURCE Leanpath<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt src=\"https:\/\/rt.prnewswire.com\/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH35420&amp;Transmission_Id=202402130843PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH35420&amp;DateId=20240213\" style=\"display:none\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Originally published at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/two-marriott-costa-rica-hotels-cut-food-waste-by-25-in-just-months-using-leanpath-302060237.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer sponsored\">https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/two-marriott-costa-rica-hotels-cut-food-waste-by-25-in-just-months-using-leanpath-302060237.html<\/a><br \/>\n<font size=\"-1\"><em>Images courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/pixabay.com<\/a><\/em><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>BEAVERTON, Ore., Feb. 13, 2024 \/PRNewswire\/ &#8212; Two Marriott hotels in Costa Rica, the Costa Rica Marriott Hacienda\u00a0Belen and Los Suenos Marriott Resort \u2013 launched the Leanpath food waste prevention platform last year and have already reduced the value of their food waste by 25%.
