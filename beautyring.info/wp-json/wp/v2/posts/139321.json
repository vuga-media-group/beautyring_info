The team considered hundreds of new hotels in the U.S. and abroad, assessing service, design, amenities, location and uniqueness of character. After visiting many of them personally, TPG eventually narrowed down the top contenders to just 37 distinctive properties that embody both the excitement of travel today and the major trends we&#8217;re following within the hospitality industry.<\/p>\n<p>New hotels on the list are reinvigorating historic landmarks, like the stately Raffles London at the OWO, and reviving beloved classics like the reincarnation of the Regent Hong Kong and makeover of the iconic Kona Village, a Rosewood Resort in <span class=\"xn-location\">Hawaii<\/span>. From the Himalayan heights of <span class=\"xn-location\">Bhutan<\/span> to the shores of <span class=\"xn-location\">Aruba<\/span>, where a new Embassy Suites puts an affordable \u2014 but still upscale \u2014 family vacation within reach for those with <span class=\"xn-location\">Hilton<\/span> points to use \u2013 the list includes a trip for everyone, especially the savvy travelers who are looking to maximize their experiences and minimize their spending.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;No traveler is any one thing,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Eric Rosen<\/span>, TPG&#8217;s director of travel content. &#8220;Sometimes, we want to splurge for a Parisian palace hotel to pamper us, and other times we just want to redeem our points for a comfortable stay so we can enjoy even more time on the road. That&#8217;s why our list truly is for everyone, whether it&#8217;s to indulge your wanderlust or simply to make the most of your limited vacation days without breaking the bank.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Going into 2024, TPG is excited to share this list of hotels in every price range and across six continents, with an option for every type of traveler.<\/p>\n<p>To schedule a press interview, please contact <span class=\"xn-person\">Grace Farley<\/span> at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection#c384b1a2a0a6ed85a2b1afa6ba83b7aba6b3acaaadb7b0a4b6baeda0acae\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"f0b782919395deb691829c9589b0849895809f999e8483978589de939f9d\">[email\u00a0protected]<\/span><\/a> or McCarthy Lupo at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection#83cee0c0e2f1f7ebfac3f7ebe6f3eceaedf7f0e4f6faade0ecee\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"97daf4d4f6e5e3ffeed7e3fff2e7f8fef9e3e4f0e2eeb9f4f8fa\">[email\u00a0protected]<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><b><u>About The Points Guy<br class=\"dnr\"><\/u><\/b>The Points Guy (TPG) is a trusted travel and lifestyle media platform that focuses on maximizing travel experiences while minimizing spending.
