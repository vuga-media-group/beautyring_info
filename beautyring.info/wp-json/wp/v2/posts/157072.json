Today, <span class=\"xn-location\">Greater Ontario&#8217;s<\/span> Tourism Marketing District features 68 hotels and 6,749 hotel rooms, and is the hub of a growing regional hospitality scene that employs 186,000 workers in the Inland Empire.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In the past year alone, the economic impact of hospitality and tourism in <span class=\"xn-location\">Greater Ontario<\/span> grew by nearly 14%, a staggering number that speaks to just how far we have come as a region,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Michael Krouse<\/span>, GOCAL&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;We are the new center of <span class=\"xn-location\">Southern California<\/span>.
