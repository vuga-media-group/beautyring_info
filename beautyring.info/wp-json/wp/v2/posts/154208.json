This support is a testament to the power of collective action in times of need. With this funding, we can continue to deliver hope, one plate at a time, to communities facing unimaginable challenges.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Together, Marriott International and the JWASM Foundation have a long history of supporting WCK&#8217;s global relief efforts financially and operationally. After the <span class=\"xn-location\">Haiti<\/span> earthquake in 2010, the company helped fund WCK&#8217;s culinary training program and hired many of the graduates to work in its hotels. When Hurricane Maria devastated <span class=\"xn-location\">Puerto Rico<\/span> in 2017, the company jumped into action. Beyond a financial donation and associate volunteer time, Dorado Beach, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve property, turned over its kitchen to become home base for the WCK team in providing desperately needed hunger relief.
