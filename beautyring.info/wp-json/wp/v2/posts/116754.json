Wave RFID for inventory in retail Wave RFID produces ROI in retail stores DALLAS - January 5, 2023 - (Newswire.com) Before RFID, the only choice was manual barcode counts that took hours or days and were only 75-85% accurate. Still, when RFID became viable around 2008, the value of RFID wasn't there because the concept of a global accurate, available inventory didn't exist.
