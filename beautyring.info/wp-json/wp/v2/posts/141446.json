Dealing with an apocalyptic theme, Wegman-Wood&#8217;s masterpiece film eerily correlates with the ongoing environmental crisis plaguing today&#8217;s world. <\/p>\n<p>Each nightmare represented a unique piece of the story that eventually converged into a single, compelling narrative. She struggled with insomnia during this period and poured her inspiration into writing the primary script for the film in a single night, Wegman-Wood explains. <\/p>\n<p>This project marks Wegman-Wood&#8217;s debut as a writer and producer, presenting numerous challenges and valuable learning experiences. In her riveting film, the actress collaborates with notable talents such as actor Cooper Andrews (The Walking Dead, Shazam!), Adam Boyer (Ozark), Merrick McCartha (All American, General Hospital), director Patrick Rea (They Wait in The Dark, I Am Lisa), and producer Sue Vicory (Original Jayhawk, One). &#8220;The team came together to bring to life the heart-wrenching story of a young mother&#8217;s struggle against societal collapse to save herself and her child,&#8221; Wegman-Wood says. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a near-future apocalypse drama \u2026 brought on by ecological disasters, so it&#8217;s not far from what could be our reality, and I think it just really struck a chord with many people,&#8221; Wegman-Wood states. &#8220;So the reception has been amazing, like everything I&#8217;d hoped it would be.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Funded with the unwavering support of friends, family, and other investors, the actress&#8217; biggest fear was not living up to expectations, expresses Wegman-Wood. <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What scared me the most was the whole thing falling apart at the last minute. So many people had donated and were supporting my endeavor, and I was really scared of letting them down,&#8221;  Wegman-Wood tells BSFF. <\/p>\n<p>As reported by <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.northcoastcurrent.com\/north-coast-beat\/2024\/01\/local-filmmaker-turns-personal-nightmare-into-an-artistic-feat-in-the-last-butterflies\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Oside News<\/a>, &#8220;The Last Butterflies&#8221; premiered at the Arizona Underground Film Festival in September 2023, achieving success with screenings at the Coronado Film Festival.
