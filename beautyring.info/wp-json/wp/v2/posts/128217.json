The financing has an initial three-year term and includes a senior secured term loan facility in an initial principal amount of <span class=\"xn-money\">$150 million<\/span> and a senior secured revolving credit facility in an initial principal amount of <span class=\"xn-money\">$50 million<\/span>. The financing includes the opportunity to expand the borrowing capacity up to an aggregate size of <span class=\"xn-money\">$400 million<\/span>, and there is a one-year extension option subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The financing is fully prepayable without penalty, and the interest rate is based upon a pricing grid related to the Company&#8217;s Net Debt to EBITDA that provides for a range of SOFR + 2.35% to 3.10%. The Company anticipates that the initial interest rate will be SOFR + 2.85%. Bank of America, N.A. acted as administrative agent and lead arranger on the transaction. Syndicate bank participants include TBK Bank and MidFirst Bank.<\/p>\n<p>The use of proceeds for the financing was to repay the mortgage debt associated with the Ritz-Carlton Sarasota, the Bardessono Hotel and Spa, and the Hotel Yountville, which will serve as the borrowing base for the financing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are pleased to complete this new corporate level financing which strengthens our balance sheet and provides enhanced optionality and financial flexibility,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Richard J.
