Signature course elements like Club Wyndham Beach are back and joined by fan favorite spots like Margaritaville at the Wyndham, the Wyndham Rewards Earner<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> Card Lounge and the USO Patriots Outpost presented by Truist and Heroes Vacation Club.

Good<\/b><br class=\"dnr\">Creating positive impact in the community is a hallmark of the Wyndham Championship, and\u00a0Wyndham Championship Fore! Good, the tournament&#8217;s signature philanthropic platform focused on youth, education and inclusivity, helps give back to worthy causes in central <span class=\"xn-org\">North Carolina<\/span> and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>Once again this year, when a PGA TOUR golfer makes birdie or better on the 15th, 16th\u00a0or 17th\u00a0hole on Saturday and Sunday, Wyndham Rewards will donate <span class=\"xn-money\">$500<\/span> to one of the Championship&#8217;s signature charities via &#8220;Birdies Fore Backpacks.&#8221; In addition, Thursday through Sunday, should a PGA TOUR player make a hole-in-one on the par-3 16th\u00a0hole, Wyndham Rewards will donate one million points to the player and an additional one million points to its Birdies Fore Backpacks charities.<\/p>\n<p>Through Birdies Fore Backpacks, Wyndham Rewards works with local organizations\u2014Backpack Beginnings, Forsyth Backpacks, Out of the Garden Project and United Way of Greater High Point\u2014to help feed children from low-income families around the Piedmont Triad region of <span class=\"xn-org\">North Carolina<\/span>. Backpacks are packed with nutritionally-sound meals, which families take home every weekend. Just <span class=\"xn-money\">$5<\/span> can feed one child for a weekend while <span class=\"xn-money\">$150<\/span> can feed a child for a school year. Fans can join Wyndham in supporting these charities with a digital donation made via QR codes placed throughout the course.<\/p>\n<p><b>Celebrating First Tee of Central Carolina and the Greensboro Six<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Building on its broader efforts surrounding Wyndham Championship Fore! Good, Wyndham Rewards yesterday surprised long-time tournament philanthropic partner First Tee &#8211; Central Carolina with plans to sponsor a commemorative mural on the side of the First Tee building\u00a0at historic Gillespie Golf Course.<\/p>\n<p>Home to the story of the Greensboro Six\u2014key players in the civil rights movement whose purposeful actions ultimately helped lead to the desegregation of professional golf\u2014today, the course serves as the organization&#8217;s local headquarters. The mural is being commissioned with input and oversight from community partners and will aim to elevate the story of the Greensboro Six while celebrating not only their impact on the game of golf, but the positive impact that Gillespie, through First Tee, continues to have on the central <span class=\"xn-org\">North Carolina<\/span> community today.<\/p>\n<p>Added Checchio, &#8220;The story of the Greensboro Six is one that doesn&#8217;t get the attention it deserves. Their actions had a profound impact not just on Greensboro and the Wyndham Championship, which in 1961 as the Greater Greensboro Open became the first PGA TOUR event to welcome a black player, but the game of golf. Their story should be known, and it should be celebrated. It&#8217;s our hope that by commissioning this mural, we can do just that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In addition to unveiling its plans for the mural, Wyndham also joined with the Tournament in making an additional donation of <span class=\"xn-money\">$200,000<\/span> in support of First Tee, helping to further the organization&#8217;s mission of helping children of all backgrounds build life skills through the game of golf. Since 2007, the collective efforts of Wyndham and the Tournament have helped to raise and donate millions to the organization.<\/p>\n<p><b>Endless Travel Options, One Award-Winning Rewards Program<\/b><br class=\"dnr\">Proud title sponsor of the Wyndham Championship since 2018, Wyndham Rewards is the blue thread tying together some of the world&#8217;s largest and most well-known travel companies and brands: Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts, the world&#8217;s largest hotel franchising company and Club Wyndham, the flagship vacation ownership brand of Wyndham Destinations, the world&#8217;s largest vacation ownership business.<\/p>\n<p>Consistently recognized by <span class=\"xn-location\">USA<\/span> TODAY as the number one hotel rewards program, and most recently US News &amp; World Report, no matter where or how you travel, Wyndham Rewards Everyone<sup>SM<\/sup>, helping to make those travels more rewarding.
