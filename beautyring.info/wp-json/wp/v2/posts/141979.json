They play a crucial role in urology, aiding individuals with bladder dysfunction by directing urine into collection bags and mitigating urology-related complications. Foley catheters are primarily employed when a person encounters difficulties with urination, such as urinary incontinence, urinary retention, or following surgeries involving the prostate or genital region. Complementary devices, including external bags and drainage tubing, are interconnected with the catheter, and a catheter valve allows for bladder emptying. These indwelling catheters can be utilized for varying durations, depending on the patient&#8217;s specific needs and medical condition. They find application in cases involving conditions such as dementia, severe urinary incontinence, or when the bladder&#8217;s muscle function is compromised.<\/p>\n<p>The availability of reimbursement for catheterization procedures in developed countries is contributing to market expansion. Technological advancements in catheter design and materials have made them safer and more comfortable, increasing their acceptance and utilization. In critical care settings, the need for precise urine output measurements is further boosting the demand for indwelling catheters. With an aging population and a growing focus on healthcare, the market is expected to continue its upward trajectory.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Seeking Deeper Insights into Competitor Analysis?
