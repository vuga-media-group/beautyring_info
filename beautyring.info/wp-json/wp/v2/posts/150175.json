As guests walk through the exhibit, they will encounter the faces and the hearts of those who answered the nation&#8217;s call and learn of their bravery on the battlefield, their journey to recovery and the continued leadership and contributions they make as civilians. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>&#8220;We are thrilled Portraits of Courage will be on display for EPCOT visitors to experience this year,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Ken Hersh<\/span>, President and CEO of the George W.
