Initiated in the confines of an ICU with nothing but an iPhone, the documentary traces the journey of Tim\u2019s father, Tod, from a life-threatening, eight-day coma to a miraculous recovery.<\/p>\n<p>Amidst this tumultuous period, the O\u2019Donnell family faced the loss of their home due to financial hardships. Yet, the most profound loss was Tod\u2019s memory of the home they once shared. Through a series of experimental installations and home movies, Tim embarks on a heartfelt mission to resurrect the memories that seem lost to his father. As memories return in the form of dreams the family struggles with acceptance of this new version of their father.<\/p>\n<p>Reflecting on the journey, Director Tim O\u2019Donnell shares, \u201cIt feels surreal to be finished with a film about my dad and family that took the last 12 years of my life to make. When my dad was in a coma and we didn&#8217;t have any information at all about what a brain injury was. We all sat down as a family and watched the documentary film &#8216;Life.Support.Music.&#8217; It was our only hope at the time. Just something out there in the ether that documented what happens during and after something like this happens. Our film took a lot longer than we expected &#8211; but now we have something to share with the next family or anyone navigating a new challenge, my dad&#8217;s new mission is to help others in any way he can. I&#8217;m very proud to be part of that. &#8216;The House We Lived In&#8217; is by far the most important thing I&#8217;ve ever gotten to make.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The House We Lived In&#8221; has not only captured the hearts of audiences but has also earned critical acclaim, receiving the Best Documentary award at the NH Film Festival, Official Selection for the San Francisco Documentary Film Festival, Woods Hole, Independent Film Festival Boston, and Ashland Film Festival with screenings at MIT, Harvard, UCLA, and many more. Its impact has been further amplified through partnerships with the Brain Injury Association of America and clips of the film having appeared on ESPN, showcasing the film\u2019s profound narrative.<\/p>\n<p>Platforms including NPR and ESPN have lauded the film, with NPR calling it \u201cA really amazing film with a great story,\u201d and ESPN describing it as \u201cAn absolute powerhouse of a film.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In alignment with Brain Injury Awareness Month, &#8220;The House We Lived In&#8221; will be released and distributed by <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/gravitasventures.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Gravitas Ventures<\/a> on March 12, 2024, through Amazon, Google Play, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/apple.co\/3OLjXtB\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Apple TV<\/a>, and more, the film promises to be a beacon of hope and a source of inspiration for many.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on Pixela Films explore their official website and for interview requests please contact Jade Umbrella PR direct.<\/p>\n<p>About Pixela Films: Pixela Films is a dynamic film production company dedicated to crafting compelling narratives that inspire and provoke thought.
