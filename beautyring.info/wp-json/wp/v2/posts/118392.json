This is certainly the case for high blood pressure, which affects nearly half of all adults in the United States\u2014only a quarter of whom have the condition under control, according to cardiologist <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/team\/robert-segal-md\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Dr. Robert Segal<\/a>, the founder of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Manhattan Cardiology<\/a>, Medical Offices of Manhattan and Co-Founder LabFinder.com. <\/p>\n<p>But these numbers are simply unacceptable, since high blood pressure\u2014when blood pushes against artery walls more forcefully than normal\u2014caused or contributed to more than 670,000 deaths in the United States in 2020, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The condition is defined as blood pressure that\u2019s at or above 130 mmHg (systolic pressure) over 80 mmHg (diastolic pressure). bit.ly\/415g5I1<\/p>\n<p>Since the condition, known medically as <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/conditions\/high-blood-pressure\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">hypertension<\/a>, places people at risk for heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease\u2014leading causes of death in the United States\u2014high blood pressure just can\u2019t be ignored, Dr. Segal says. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat makes it even more dangerous is that it often produces no symptoms,\u201d says Dr. Segal, a fellow of the American College of Cardiology whose research has been published in many respected medical journals. \u201cSome people with high blood pressure may experience headaches, shortness of breath, or nosebleeds, but these signs aren\u2019t exclusive to it and often don\u2019t occur until high blood pressure has become severe or life-threatening.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What leads to high blood pressure?  <\/p>\n<p>Anyone can develop high blood pressure, but certain risk factors make it more likely, Dr. Segal says. These include:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tFamily history: Family members have high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tRace: Black people are more predisposed than those from other groups.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tAge: It\u2019s more common in people over 55.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tWeight: Those overweight or obese are more apt to develop high blood pressure.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tSedentary: Exercise can help stave off the condition.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tHigh-salt diet<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tTobacco use<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tAlcohol use: More than one drink per day for women, or two for men, can raise the odds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that lifestyle choices play a large role in who develops high blood pressure, though that\u2019s not always the case,\u201d Dr. Segal explains. \u201cThere\u2019s no single cause for the condition, but there are certainly plenty of contributing factors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>How high blood pressure is diagnosed and treated  <\/p>\n<p>High blood pressure is fairly straightforward to diagnose, Dr. Segal says. Doing so involves checking blood pressure with a special cuff or device. This is usually done at an annual check-up or doctor\u2019s appointment. \u201cIf the reading is high at two or more visits, your doctor may tell you that you have high blood pressure,\u201d he explains.  <\/p>\n<p>Treating the condition, however, is quite individualized, depending on a person\u2019s other health conditions, lifestyle, age and other contributing factors. Medical guidelines help doctors match the best blood pressure drugs to each person, with several main classes of medications available\u2014each working a little differently to reduce blood pressure. According to Dr. Segal, these include:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tBeta blockers, reducing heart rate and cutting the heart\u2019s workload<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tDiuretics, which help the kidneys remove extra salt and water from the body <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tACE inhibitors, which help blood vessels stay relaxed by blocking an enzyme that causes them to tighten<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tARBs, which block a receptor that constricts blood vessels<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tCalcium channel blockers, which relax blood vessels<\/p>\n<p>Often, people with high blood pressure need more than one medication to successfully treat it, Dr. Segal notes. But they should also blend a healthy lifestyle with prescription medications for a one-two punch to keep the condition at bay.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEat foods lower in fat, salt and calories, and make physical activity a bigger part of your day,\u201d he advises. \u201cSimple, commonsense measures can both prevent high blood pressure and help keep it under control.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Manhattan Cardiology is the premier facility for preventive cardiology treatment in New York.
