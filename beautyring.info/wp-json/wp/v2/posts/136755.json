Deitemeyer was president and CEO of Interstate Hotels &amp; Resorts from 2017 until the merger and has been in the hotel industry for nearly four decades.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to thank Mike for his contributions to building the Aimbridge legacy. Under his leadership, the company ramped up its commitment to appointing and developing top talent, led several strategic acquisitions that allowed the company to gain a foothold in new markets, and strengthened our relationship with world&#8217;s top brands. Mike&#8217;s contributions further reinforced Aimbridge&#8217;s reputation as a dominant force in the industry and positioned the company for its next phase of growth,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Glenn Murphy<\/span>, Chairman of the Board.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The company also announced the appointment of two impressive leaders, <span class=\"xn-person\">Stephen Joyce<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-person\">Bernardo Hees<\/span> to its Board of Managers.<\/p>\n<p>Joyce is a global hospitality veteran with more than four decades of multi-brand and franchisee experience, including nearly a decade serving as President and CEO of Choice Hotels International.

Both have proven experience in driving outsized results for companies and owners, as well as building high-performance cultures,&#8221; Murphy said.<\/p>\n<p>Joyce and Hees will join Murphy and <span class=\"xn-person\">Jeff Case<\/span>, Managing Director at Advent International, on the Executive Committee and work closely with Aimbridge&#8217;s senior leadership team to drive performance.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The third-party management space is the future of the industry, and Aimbridge is poised to lead the way. The company plans to supercharge growth by expanding our current capabilities and zeroing in on areas that pose the greatest opportunities to gain market share, all while delivering superior results for our owners,&#8221; Murphy said.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, CFO <span class=\"xn-person\">Thomas Song<\/span> will depart Aimbridge for a new opportunity outside of the hotel industry on <span class=\"xn-chron\">November 30, 2023<\/span>.
