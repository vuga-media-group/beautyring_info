All guests need to do is scan a QR code using the camera on their mobile phone, tap the banner that appears on their screen, and then securely tip using their preferred payment method. eTip also offers &#8220;tap to tip,&#8221; which gives users the ability to pay through an NFC-enabled QR-code. The feature is activated by a user tapping their smartphone on the QR code, automatically opening the profile of the associate or department the guest wishes to tip. Once the guest leaves a tip electronically, associates can quickly receive the tip in their bank account through Visa Direct, eliminating the need to wait for a tip to be paid through the weekly or bi-weekly payroll process. eTip makes digital tipping easier and faster for guests and associates.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are seeing an increase in market demand for a fast, reliable, and fully digitized tipping experience for hotel guests and employees in the hospitality industry,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Yanilsa Gonzalez-Ore<\/span>, Senior Vice President of Visa Direct. &#8220;eTip now offers a digital tipping solution, enabled by Visa Direct, to Baywood Hotels, helping to modernize that process for their guests and employees.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>Key Capabilities of eTip:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><i>No app required<\/i>. Guests don&#8217;t need to download yet another app on their phone. eTip opens directly in their phone&#8217;s browser.<\/li>\n<li><i>Flexible and secure payment options<\/i>.
