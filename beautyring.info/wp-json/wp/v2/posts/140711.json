It\u2019s an honor to speak with one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best Eye Doctors&#8221; as compiled by Newsweek (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/rankings\/americas-best-eye-doctors-2022\/optometrists\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/rankings\/americas-best-eye-doctors-2022\/optometrists<\/a>). We understand that you opened Greenwich Eye Care in Old Greenwich, CT, in 2017 and more recently opened another office, Pro Eye Care, in Darien, CT. Please share with us what motivated you to start your own practice.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Inna Lazar: Thank you so much for having me; it&#8217;s a great honor. After moving to Connecticut and working in various practices\u2014private, commercial, and refractive surgery\u2014I quickly realized that two crucial aspects of eye care were either missing or not as well addressed as they should be: dry eye disease diagnosis and treatment and myopia management. Indeed, you could find providers who would address these issues, but it was not their primary focus. This realization led me to open my own practice, where I could fully dedicate myself to these two areas. My goal was to become an expert, devoting 100% of my time and effort to dry eye disease and pediatric myopia management.<\/p>\n<p>Publisher: May we have an overview of the Conditions Treated (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.drinnalazar.com\/conditions-treated\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.drinnalazar.com\/conditions-treated<\/a>) at your offices? <\/p>\n<p>Dr. Inna Lazar: We are a comprehensive primary eye care practice with a specialized focus on diagnosing and treating dry eye disease, as well as managing pediatric myopia. Our clinic leverages the latest technology to accurately diagnose and effectively treat dry eye, a condition currently affecting an estimated 20 million Americans, though we believe the actual numbers may be significantly higher.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, we provide targeted care for children diagnosed with myopia, particularly those showing signs of progression. By utilizing advanced technology, we diagnose ocular misalignments, thereby aiding patients who suffer from related headaches, neck pain, and eye discomfort. We use over ten billion data points, with each patient contributing 10,000 individual data points, to continuously refine our algorithm through machine learning.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond these specialized services, our practice is also equipped to diagnose and treat various eye diseases, including glaucoma and macular degeneration. Our commitment to employing cutting-edge technology and providing personalized care positions us at the forefront of eye health management.<\/p>\n<p>Publisher: One will read on your site about the investigative and diagnostic capabilities you provide and this is quite compelling\u2026<\/p>\n<p>INVESTIGATION AT ITS FINEST <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFrom eye strain to double vision, the job of an optometrist to weigh the possibilities and rule out causes one by one. Your four-year old&#8217;s eyes will be very different from your teenager&#8217;s, so you&#8217;ll need a pediatric eye care doctor who understands each developmental stage and its characteristics. The right optometrist will be able to ask questions to really find out what&#8217;s going on with someone&#8217;s eyes. Getting a child to articulate their eyesight problems isn&#8217;t easy, but our doctors and staff are here to help.<\/p>\n<p>Care to elaborate?<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Inna Lazar:  Diagnosing eye issues, especially in children, is a complex task that requires a careful and systematic approach. Effective communication is a key aspect of our approach, especially with younger patients who may find it challenging to express their vision problems. Our team combines observational skills, child-friendly communication techniques, and specialized diagnostic tools to accurately assess and understand their visual experiences. <\/p>\n<p>This ability to connect with our young patients and make them feel comfortable and understood is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Our comprehensive knowledge and exceptional communication skills position us as specialists in pediatric eye care, making us the trusted choice for your child&#8217;s eye health needs.<\/p>\n<p>Publisher: Your team (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.drinnalazar.com\/meet-the-optometrist\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.drinnalazar.com\/meet-the-optometrist<\/a>) is also quite impressive.

Joining her is Dr. Sasha Patel, our latest addition, who brings her passion for primary and preventative eye care from Florida, a testament to our practice&#8217;s growing prestige in attracting top-tier talent.<\/p>\n<p>Equally impressive is Dr. Danielle Polvanov, who practices closely in our dry eye clinic. Her dedication shines through her daily commute from New York, underscoring her commitment to our patients and the practice&#8217;s growth. Together, this formidable team positions our practice at the forefront of eye care, combining specialized skills with a personal approach that sets a new standard in patient care.<\/p>\n<p>Publisher: The testimonials on your site from happy patients speak volumes about your services, capabilities, the high-level of care, and the positive results that you provide.

We also attract patients who find us on social media and travel significant distances to receive our care. A notable group among our patients are those who struggle with severe eye dryness, which hampers their ability to perform at work effectively. With our variety of treatments, we have been successful in not only properly diagnosing but also treating these cases. Our patients not only feel better but also experience a visible improvement in their appearance. They no longer have to constantly rely on eye whitening drops to look presentable and avoid the appearance of being sick with red eyes all the time.

We eagerly await the opportunity to welcome you to an era of exceptional care.<\/p>\n<p>Publisher:  The winter season is upon us now in the Connecticut area, and Spring is right around the corner. Please share with our readers some of your best \u201ctips\u201d to deal with dry eyes and allergies.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Inna Lazar: As we transition from the chilly embrace of winter to the budding warmth of spring in Connecticut, it&#8217;s essential to address the common issues of dry eyes and allergies that many of our patients face. A humidifier becomes your best friend during these months, combating the dry indoor air resulting from heating systems. Protect your eyes with sunglasses when stepping outdoors, especially on windy days. Daily eyelid hygiene is essential to prevent bacterial overgrowth and accumulation of allergens. Additionally, incorporating moisture eye drops and allergy or eye drop medications during spring into your daily routine can offer substantial relief; however, always consult your eye doctor before starting any new medication.<\/p>\n<p>But the battle against dry eyes and allergies doesn&#8217;t stop there. Minimizing exposure to allergens is key; keep windows closed on high pollen days and consider using air purifiers indoors. An often-overlooked tip is to change your clothes and shower after outdoor activities to get rid of pollen. For those of us glued to screens, remember to blink regularly. Embrace the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This not only helps in keeping your eyes moist but also reduces strain. Don&#8217;t underestimate the power of diet\u2014foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids like fish, flaxseed, and walnuts can improve tear quality. And finally, if symptoms persist, consult an eye doctor for personalized advice and treatment. <\/p>\n<p>Publisher: Congratulations on the excellent resources you provide on your site about eye care: Educational Videos (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.drinnalazar.com\/educational-videos\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.drinnalazar.com\/educational-videos<\/a>), Blog (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.drinnalazar.com\/blog\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.drinnalazar.com\/blog<\/a>), Newsletter &amp; Community Content (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.drinnalazar.com\/articles\/general\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.drinnalazar.com\/articles\/general<\/a>), and so much more.

We are very proud of this organization; we have been able to help, and continue to help, many people in Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p>Publisher: Thank you again for joining us today, Inna. Is there anything else you would like to discuss today? <\/p>\n<p>Dr. Inna Lazar: Thank you for this opportunity.
