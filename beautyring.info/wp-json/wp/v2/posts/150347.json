According to the study, the more ACEs a child experiences, the greater the likelihood that child will live in poverty, suffer depression, commit a violent crime, or otherwise struggle in adulthood. A child who experiences married fatherhood throughout his childhood will, on average, experience far fewer ACEs than one who does not. Additionally, the study found that 77 percent of all church-attending men ages 18-29 grew up in a continuously married home through age 18. Author Dr. Jim Grassi has spent over four decades working in men\u2019s ministry and in his latest book, \u201cThe Watchman: A Clarion Call for Men to Stand in the Gap,\u201d Dr. Grassi pulls no punches on how the current culture is affecting manhood.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI believe our culture is doing everything it can to belittle and silence men,\u201d says Grassi. \u201cAdded to that are the normal, everyday issues men face of feeding and housing their families in a rocky economy. But too many men respond poorly to these threats and begin to abandon their families emotionally and physically. For society to function properly, each gender must fulfill his and her roles and responsibilities as God intended. I believe that we can summarize all male characteristics and roles with two primary responsibilities: protector and provider. We see these two male responsibilities in the Bible, and whether we acknowledge it or not, they are innate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Grassi founded <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/mensministrycatalyst.org\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Men\u2019s Ministry Catalyst<\/a> in 1981 which partners with church leaders, businessmen, professional athletes, and denominations in discovering and implementing a relational process for men to connect with each other and grow in faith together. Dr. Grassi has also served as chaplain for two NFL teams (Oakland Raiders and San Francisco 49er\u2019s) as well as the Post Falls Idaho Police Department and Kootetai County Fire and Rescue. An avid outdoorsman, Dr. Grassi was inducted into the National Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame, is a member of the Safari Club, and is a Record Book Big Game Archer. Dr. Grassi understands the importance of molding and shaping men for this and the next generation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I see too many men standing and watching as our families are corrupted with mixed messages,&#8221; says Dr. Grassi. &#8220;Men need to root themselves back into the biblical values that create a stable culture. The Bible commands men to love their wives sacrificially and to honor, respect, and protect women in general. Likewise, men are supposed to father and mentor their children by living under the same roof, treating them gently, leading them and modeling for them what it means to follow Godly principles.\u201d \ufeff<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Gina Adams<br \/>The Adams Group<br \/>+1 615-776-1590<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/706596587\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=jz_zEHIGWtsuOinw&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      May 03, 2024, 15:31 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/706596587\/author-of-new-book-claims-biblical-manhood-may-be-a-thing-of-the-past\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
