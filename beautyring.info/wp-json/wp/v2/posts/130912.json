Pomegranate showcases that no matter what our religious and political views might be in the end we all want the same thing, happiness and respect. Everyone deserves the right to live their lives without fear and judgement and to see the characters in Pomegranate slowly also start to comprehend this fact is beautiful to witness.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>ZAIN SHAMI is a Los Angeles based actress and stand-up comedian. She&#8217;s one of the first internationally known Hijabi Muslim females who performs standup comedy within the United States. Born in Kuwait, to Iraqi parents, Zain left the Middle East at the young age of two, whereupon her parents immigrated to California. Raised in Los Angeles with a very unique perspective on religion and culture, she is able to grapple with her unique and unrivaled upbringing with a lot of laughter and love! As an actress she\u2019s been on numerous television shows and films helping to bridge the gap between Muslims and non-Muslims alike by normalizing the everyday life of a Muslim American female. You can catch her on tv\/film platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Comedy Central and even the Late Late Show with James Corden. She is active on social media as @ZainComedy, she has over 165 thousand followers on Instagram, and 1.2 mil on TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>For Pomegranate, Zain takes on the role of Hassina Al Mousawi Niran\u2019s loving but strict Muslim mother. A strong woman, Hassina thinks muumuus are the latest American fashion always wearing a matching hijab. Under her muumuus, Hassina wears the family pants. Easily irritable, she\u2019s obsessed with food and keeps their dual-sided refrigerator and freezer stocked to overflowing. Her biggest problem is getting her food stamp card renewed so her family won\u2019t starve. She\u2019s also obsessed with marrying Niran off and keeps Polaroid snaps of possible suitors in her bra.<\/p>\n<p>Pomegranate is a dramedy by writer-director Weam Namou, partly based on her childhood experiences immigrating from Iraq to the United States, and then as an adult living through the presidential election of 2016. Consequently, Pomegranate is the story about how, in the weeks before the election of Donald Trump in 2016, a young, politically liberal, Iraqi Muslim immigrant struggles to find her footing in a neighborhood of well-to-do, politically conservative, Iraqi Christians, while battling her family\u2019s fears of deprivation and demands of loyalty to Muslim traditions.
