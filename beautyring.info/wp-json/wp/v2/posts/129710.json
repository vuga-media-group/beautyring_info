In that letter\u2019s opening, the filmmaker recalls a morose conversation between his grandfather and another familiar member in which they bemoan the chronic troubles of their country, Haiti. They find themselves desperately hoping for an American intervention, seeing it as the only solution for their ravaged nation. Alain reminds his grandfather that the US had already occupied Haiti and only left it more impoverished. As the letter continues, the brutal decades of the Occupation come to light, betraying the complicated history of a people who, a century ago, looked to the US for guidance only to find themselves enmeshed in violent clashes of race, culture and class, resulting in the wholesale theft of their homeland.<\/p>\n<p>Trailer: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/767261258\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/vimeo.com\/767261258<\/a><\/p>\n<p>AYITI: A HAITIAN STORY <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFeature Film &#8211; Runtime: 58 minutes<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThis film is a tribute to the beauty and strength of Haitian culture and a reminder of its importance in today&#8217;s world.<\/p>\n<p>CETTE MAISON (THIS HOUSE) <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFeature Film &#8211; Runtime: 1 hour 15 minutes<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBridgeport, 2008.
