It was unearthed in 11 days after an estimated 67 million years in that spot.<\/p>\n<p>Giant plaster jackets containing the \u201cTeen Rex\u201d are now at the Denver Museum, where the public can follow its preparation.<\/p>\n<p>The secret of the find held as an award-winning documentary crew, renowned palaeontologists, several of the world\u2019s foremost natural history museums, and top animators partnered to present the kids\u2019 discovery in dramatic cinematic fashion.<\/p>\n<p>Giant Screen Films (GSF), a leading large-format documentary producer, was embedded with the expedition and had cameras rolling as the fossil\u2019s diagnostic features were unearthed, including the moment Dr. Lyson confirmed that the kids had found a T-REX. <\/p>\n<p>As a result, audiences can experience the adventure of the discovery and excavation in T-REX, an immersive large screen documentary narrated by Jurrasic Park actor Sir Sam Neill.<\/p>\n<p>With hat tips to famous specimens, landmark discoveries, and wild cinematic T-REX depictions over the last century, GSF\u2019s documentary intercuts the remarkable expedition with cutting edge computer graphics that bring the iconic T-REX\u2014from hatchling to hulking adult\u2014to life. <\/p>\n<p>\u2018Juvenile rex specimens are extremely rare,\u201d said Dr. Lyson, who found his first dinosaur in the same area at age 6. He credits his own career to the mentorship of palaeontologists who invited him to join their work in the Badlands. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis find is significant to researchers because the \u2018Teen Rex\u2019 specimen may help answer questions about how the king of dinosaurs grew up,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The size of the specimen\u2019s tibia (shin bone), compared to the size for a full grown adult\u2019s tibia, suggests that it was 13 to 15 years old when it died.<\/p>\n<p>Palaeontologists also estimate that \u201cTeen Rex\u201d likely weighed around 3,500 pounds (1,632 kg), measured roughly 25 feet (7.6 m) from nose to tail, and stood about 10 feet (3 m) in height\u2014about two-thirds the size of a full grown adult.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to consider how T-REX might have grown from a kitten-sized hatchling into the 40-foot, 8,000 pound adult predator we are familiar with,\u201d said renowned T-REX authority Dr. Thomas Holtz of the University of Maryland. <\/p>\n<p>He continued, \u201cscientists can really only speculate on how \u2018Teen rex\u2019 might have lived and behaved, so discoveries like this one have the potential to provide important new information about those earlier life stages, when fastest growth likely occurred.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The experience was especially exciting for Jessin, a dinosaur aficionado and aspiring palaeontologist who dressed up as his hero, Dr. Lyson, for Halloween a few years ago. <\/p>\n<p>The boys will help officially open the \u201cTeen Rex Prep Lab\u201d and attend the film&#8217;s premiere at the Denver Museum of Nature &amp; Science June 21. A hometown area screening is also planned for the boys&#8217; Marmarth classmates, including some early skeptics.<\/p>\n<p>With Dr. Holtz as lead advisor, T-REX filmmakers collaborated with palaeontologists, eight prominent natural history museums, and award-winning visual effects artists to create scientifically-accurate models of T-REX and the prehistoric ecosystem of Hell Creek, a highly studied rock formation in the Upper Midwest containing fossil remains from the dinosaurs&#8217; final days.<\/p>\n<p>Supported by leading museums worldwide, the documentary features cameos of SUE, perhaps the most well-known T-REX specimen ever found (Field Museum, Chicago); T-REX WYREX (Houston Museum of Natural History); T-REX THOMAS (Los Angeles Natural History Museum) and HORRIDUS the Triceratops (Melbourne Museum). <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe never could have planned the inspiring story that unfolded in front of the cameras,\u2019 said producer and writer Andy Wood. \u201cKids finding any large dinosaur is remarkable, but as the shoot progressed, the team realized that we were witnessing something even more rare\u2014a truly historic T-REX discovery. It\u2019s been a real thrill.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is more than just a documentary\u2014it&#8217;s a chance for families to experience the thrill of discovery through the eyes of these young explorers in a format that makes you feel like you\u2019re right there with them,\u201d says co-director\/writer David Clark.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is the kind of story that documentary filmmakers dream of capturing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBeyond fostering an appreciation of the fun of science, the film sends a message about getting outside and exploring,\u201d said Dr. Lyson. \u201cThat\u2019s a really important message that we want to come through\u2014one that I think is just baked into this story.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Full media kit: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/3yLF89F\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/bit.ly\/3yLF89F<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The fossil was collected on land under the jurisdiction of the US Bureau of Land Management, permit ND2023-00084.<\/p>\n<p>T-REX is a Giant Screen Films and D3D Cinema production, in partnership with:<\/p>\n<p>Field Museum, Chicago<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDenver Museum of Nature &amp; Science<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHouston Museum of Natural Science<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nNatural History Museum of Los Angeles County<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nin association with<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nCincinnati Museum Center<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nCleveland Museum of Natural History<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMuseums Victoria, Australia, and<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nNew Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science<\/p>\n<p>Giant Screen Films <\/p>\n<p>Based in Evanston, Illinois, GSF is one of the world\u2019s leading and most active large-format film producers.
