He\u2019s no longer running from the pain of his past of hiding from those to whom he is accountable. In his new book, \u201cWhat I Wish I Knew\u201d, Josh speaks to the work, vulnerability, acceptance, and many uncomfortable things it takes to create true love, which is what makes true love so rare. Powell is no stranger to being the object of one\u2019s affection. As he confesses in the book, many of those relationships, &#8220;situationships,&#8221; and romantic partnerships were maligned, mismanaged, and always seemed to end up out of bounds. The turnovers led to a divorce, several children, and even the loss of close friendships and business partnerships. <\/p>\n<p>As a two-time champion with the Los Angeles Lakers, Powell has had his share of success on the hardwood. Failure in real-life relationships forced Powell to a face-off with the man in the mirror. After spending time reflecting on years of destructive patterns and behaviors, he discovered why he missed shots and failed to take wide-open shots in relationships. The answer was staring him in the face as he stood in the mirror. <\/p>\n<p>This revelation wasn\u2019t limited to romance. Family, friends, and work were all affected by the man known as Josh Powell. The deeper revelation that Powell shares in his book is that his intrapersonal relationship, his most important relationship is the one that needed the most work. After a season of separation from some of his most prolific relationships, Powell has checked in again. One of the most productive partnerships is with Chanel Nicole Scott of CheMinistry. Together with Scott, the tandem launched the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@RelationshipsMatterPodcast\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">&#8220;Relationship Matters&#8221; podcast<\/a>, earlier this year. <\/p>\n<p>Josh Powell is ready to share his life\u2019s lessons with readers everywhere in \u201cWhat I Wish I Knew\u201d and looks forward to unleashing transparency and self-awareness in hopes of helping men and women prevent the self-sabotaging habits that alienate them from the people they love. In his words, \u201cThis means taking accountability for our choices, setting healthy boundaries, and giving ourselves permission to realign or redefine our WHY so that the outcomes line up more closely with our intentions. This is how to build a divine foundation\u201d Powell says of this newfound outlook on life and relationships, \u201cI hope to encourage you to take inventory of the things around you that you can control and not be controlled by the things around you.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>To celebrate the book\u2019s release, Powell, Scott, and friends are hosting a book release party on Sunday, October 29th.
