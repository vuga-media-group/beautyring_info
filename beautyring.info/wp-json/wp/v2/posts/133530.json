Composed of three main parts, the first and third parts were written by Young-hee Shim, the patient who suffered severely from FMD, and the second part by Sang-Jin Han, her husband and care-giver as well. Part 1 describes the onset and progression of the disease, its symptoms, the recuperation process including medical examinations and diagnoses, drug treatment, and exercise therapy. Part 3 describes the day-to-day course of relearning everything anew beginning from breathing and stretching up to the recovery stage beginning with therapeutic walks. Part 2 shows the care-giver\u2019s observation and records of the factual trajectories of the illness in great detail, in a meticulously careful and reflexive manner, thereby candidly disclosing his lived experience of what love means and how family supports could have continued.  <\/p>\n<p>When someone in the family becomes ill, it affects the entire family. Anxiety eats away at the soul, and disease even more so. As the saying goes, \u2018A long illness will break even the most filial son\u2019. The family member caring for the patient suffers as much as the patient, and is placed in a difficult situation that requires patience and dedication. However, readers of the book will meet a warm couple and their family and friends, who comfort and care for each other even in times of extreme pain and fatigue. The book offers a moving story fully describing how the patient, despite the lack of memories except her own experiences of illness could have recovered her narratives and combined them into the vivid daily records prepared by husband while she immersed into sleeping every night. <\/p>\n<p>Singing to his crying wife in the middle of the night as he tends to her needs, he is an active caregiver who seeks a vehicle for treatment through frequent walks and exercising rather than staying in bed, and who, while getting angry from time to time amid the frustration of his situation, soon realizes his fault and humbly apologizes for losing his temper. This can be said to be the power of an intellect that controls emotion and manages struggle through constant self-reflection, and at the same time, is a testimony to the couple\u2019s decades-long intellectual and mutually engaged social life. <\/p>\n<p>In this book, readers encounter a powerful example of love and care that avoids falling into the sad, gloomy, tragic atmosphere of battling illness. This is another virtue. In doing so, it may provide comfort and courage to patients and their families who are tired and depressed from the pain and responsibility that disease incurs. The authors hoped to be of some help to those patients and families suffering from FMD and other rare diseases, offering hope for recovery by their own example.<\/p>\n<p>Love As Healing is a story of triumph over a terrifying and poorly understood disease through courage and devotion. It has its hero and heroine faced suddenly with a sickness which sets out to paralyse the body. It records their lengthy search for treatments not \u201cthe talking cure\u201d, but a long slow cure through love. Inspiring, humbling, and as intensely Korean as it is resonantly universal in its message.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2015John Dunn, Professor Emeritus of Cambridge University, UK<\/p>\n<p>Functional movement disorders have been known since the dawn of medicine, but physicians were not educated about them. This sad situation is now being changed. This interesting book details the course of the disorder.  The detail of the story is unmatched in the literature and shows the difficulties of patients and the improvements correlated with psychological and social factors. What can be better than love?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2015Mark Hallett, MD, NINDS Scientist Emeritus, National Institutes of Health, USA<\/p>\n<p>Love As Healing is a moving account of how a woman accustomed to flying high from one academic venue to another is brought low by a mysterious attack on her body. Love As Healing is a book of lessons\u2014not just for the ill seeking recovery\u2014but for all who are torn by wars or civil strife. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2015Charles Lemert, Professor Emeritus of Wesleyan University, USA<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Young-Hee Shim<br \/>Hanyang University<br \/>+ +821099818474<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/659858718\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Oh, my life is over!<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"_KHPbwQV3U4\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"\u300a\uadfc\uc721\uc774 \ub9c8\uad6c \ub5a8\ub9ac\ub294\ub370 \ub9c8\uc74c\uc758 \ubcd1\uc774\ub77c\ub2c8!\u300b - \uc544, \ub0b4 \uc778\uc0dd\uc740 \ub05d\uc7a5\ub0ac\uad6c\ub098\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/_KHPbwQV3U4?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=5LsGcEN_vTFEAqLC&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      October 05, 2023, 13:04 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/659858718\/love-as-healing-the-first-book-about-fmd-written-by-a-patient-young-hee-shim-with-the-help-of-her-caregiver-spouse\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
