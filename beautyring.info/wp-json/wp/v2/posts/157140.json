analysing sustainability efforts in the business world, the S&amp;P Global Sustainability Yearbook recognised Sands China with a Top 1% ranking in both the <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> and Global editions this year. This assessment is based on the company&#8217;s score in S&amp;P&#8217;s 2023 annual Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA).<\/p>\n<p>More than 1,700 companies across 60 industries from mainland <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Hong Kong<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Macao<\/span> were assessed in the <b><span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> edition<\/b> of the 2024 yearbook. Sands <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> was one of only 12 companies achieving Top 1% ESG performance.<\/p>\n<p>In the <b>Global edition<\/b>, Sands China was among only 66 companies that scored Top 1% ESG performance. The yearbook assessed over 9,400 companies across 62 industries.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-person\">Grant Chum<\/span>, chief executive officer and executive director of Sands China Ltd., said: &#8220;We are thrilled and honoured to be recognised by S&amp;P Global for our efforts in corporate sustainability. We extend our gratitude to our team members for their dedication to supporting the company&#8217;s sustainable development strategy as we strive for excellence in ESG. Being recognised as an ESG leader in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> is a significant achievement, but being in the top 1 percent globally and the global leader in our industry for ESG is even more gratifying. With our deep roots in <span class=\"xn-location\">Macao<\/span> for over 20 years, Sands China remains committed to our three corporate responsibility pillars, People, Community, and Planet, and we dedicate this honour to our devoted team members, suppliers, and community partners for their unwavering efforts in sustainability.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sands <span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> exceptional ESG performance is exemplified by its 2.33 million hours of workforce training in 2023 and a 17.5% reduction in gas emissions ahead of schedule. Additionally, the company&#8217;s volunteer team, the Sands Cares Ambassadors, has contributed more than 310,000 hours of voluntary community service over the years.<\/p>\n<p><b>S&amp;P Global&#8217;s 2023 Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA)<\/b>\u00a0is an evaluation of the sustainability practices of companies from around the world, with only those performing in the top 15 percent of their industries included in the Global Sustainability Yearbook. It uses a consistent, rule-based methodology to convert an average of 1,000 data points per company to an S&amp;P Global CSA Score.<\/p>\n<p>The underlying metrics, questions, and criteria that make up the scores are weighted according to their relevance and materiality within each industry, and cover a comprehensive range of governance and economic, environmental, and social categories, including transparency and reporting, business ethics, climate strategy, labor practice indicators, human rights, and human capital development.\u00a0With 62 industry-specific questionnaires each containing more than 100 questions covering an average of 23 different key themes, the CSA data is convincing, insightful and actionable.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the Global Sustainability Yearbook, S&amp;P Global has also recognised Sands China&#8217;s ESG achievements in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI). In 2023, Sands China was listed in the DJSI World and DJSI Asia Pacific indices, marking the company&#8217;s second consecutive year on the world index and its third on the <span class=\"xn-location\">Asia Pacific<\/span> index. The DJSI is one of the most highly recognised indices for corporate sustainability and is considered the gold standard for measuring and advancing global ESG efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Sands <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> executes its ESG efforts within the context of the People, Community, and Planet pillars of parent company Las Vegas Sands&#8217; corporate social responsibility platform. A variety of initiatives include programmes such as the Sands ECO360 global sustainability programme; the Sands Cares corporate giving and community engagement programme; and the Sands China Academy, a team member professional development programme. Sands <span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> strong track record in sustainable business performance through the economic value and social impact it has delivered is part of its commitment to serve the <span class=\"xn-location\">Macao<\/span> community and contribute to making it a better place to live and work.<\/p>\n<p><b>About Sands China Ltd. <\/b><\/p>\n<p>Sands China Ltd.
