Projected to reach USD 8.87 billion by 2031 from USD 2.98 billion in 2023, this market exhibits a CAGR of 14.62% during the forecast period 2024-2031.<\/p>\n<p>Growing Demand for Immersive Content<\/p>\n<p>The market&#8217;s growth stems from a confluence of factors. During the pandemic, shifts in content delivery and production strategies ignited a rise in consumer demand for media and increased spending on content creation. Technology also evolves rapidly, presenting challenges for late adopters but driving early movers to enhance their offerings in a competitive market. For example, V\u016b Technologies&#8217; USD 17 million seed investment in March 2022 fueled its virtual production studio network. Technological advances like the Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) democratize advanced production processes like in-camera and pre-visualization effects. This engine is gaining traction in movies, series, and beyond. Singapore&#8217;s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) even earmarked USD 3.6 million to boost international content partnerships and train local businesses in utilizing the Unreal Engine for virtual production.<\/p>\n<p>Download Free Sample Report @ <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.snsinsider.com\/sample-request\/2588\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.snsinsider.com\/sample-request\/2588<\/a> <\/p>\n<p>KEY PLAYERS:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; Adobe<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; Epic Games<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; HumanEyes Technologies<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; NVIDIA Corporation<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; Technicolor<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; Autodesk<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; HTC Corporation<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; Mo-Sys Engineering<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; Pixar<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; Vicon Motion Systems<\/p>\n<p>Real-time visual generation with game engines is transformative.
