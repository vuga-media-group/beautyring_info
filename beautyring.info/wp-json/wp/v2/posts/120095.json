This is largely due to a growing movement of women of color who have embraced their natural hair texture and sought out products that cater to their specific needs.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty industry has long been dominated by a narrow set of standards that favor eurocentric features and straight hair. This has left many women of color feeling excluded and underrepresented in the beauty world. Women with curly and natural hair have struggled to find products that are designed for their hair texture and don&#8217;t contain harmful chemicals that could damage their hair. That\u2019s why when Abenaa Brew, a cosmetic chemist and black woman entrepreneur, set out to create her own hair care products, she used her education to inform her formulas, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.hairbrewproducts.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Hair Brew<\/a> was born. <\/p>\n<p>Featuring natural ingredients that are carefully selected to promote healthy hair growth, strengthen hair, and protect hair from damage, Hair Brew is changing the way people care for their hair.
