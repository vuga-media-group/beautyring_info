Leading Chicago plastic surgeon, Dr Sam Speron, has shared some expert tips on how to look after scars to help them heal and minimize their impact.<\/p>\n<p>A natural part of healing<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cThe most important thing to remember is that a scar is a natural part of the healing process,\u201d Dr Speron explains. \u201cWhatever the cause, a scar is testament to the body\u2019s incredible ability to heal and regenerate. By working with that process, patients can ensure their scar heals effectively and as aesthetically as possible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The appearance of a scar will change over time, a result of the natural evolution of scar tissue. \u201cThe initial appearance, whether it\u2019s the result of surgery or an accidental cut, often scares people,\u201d Dr Speron warns. \u201cThe scar can appear red and inflamed, and may feel numb. This is perfectly normal, and the result of the work the body is doing to heal and rejuvenate the area.\u201d It is vital to follow any specific medical advice given in the initial days and weeks by a surgeon.<\/p>\n<p>However, the healing process can take as long as 12-18 months, and while the changes are more dramatic during the early stages, caring for a scar is important throughout.<\/p>\n<p>Caring for a scar<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSun protection for a scar is just as essential as any other part of the body. \u201cThink about it, the scar tissue is brand-new skin. It is delicate and needs protecting from harmful UV rays,\u201d says Dr. Speron. Exposure to sunlight can not only slow the healing process, but can also result in a darker scar once fully healed.<\/p>\n<p>Protecting a scar depends on its location. It could be covered with clothing, shaded with a hat, or, if exposed, then using sunscreen with an SPF factor of at least 30.<\/p>\n<p>Massage is also highly recommended. \u201cMassage helps in several ways, but most of all by keeping the skin pliable,\u201d Dr Speron says. \u201cScar tissue is often quite taut and stiff; massaging helps to get it more supple quicker.\u201d He recommends gently massaging the scar with fingertips for 2-10 minutes, 2-4 times a day.<\/p>\n<p>Treating scars<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThere are several products that can help heal optimally. Dr Speron recommends <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.drsperonsnaturalskincare.com\/collections\/scar-treatment\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">silicone products<\/a>, which can be worn under clothing \u2014 and even under makeup \u2014 helping to keep pressure on the scar tissue while also hydrating as it heals.<\/p>\n<p>Dr Speron also has a range of all natural products, including a <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.drsperonsnaturalskincare.com\/products\/best-scar-support-treatment\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Scar Support Treatment<\/a>. Professionally developed, it includes natural ingredients that provide a wide range of benefits, including keeping the skin hydrated, promoting skin regeneration, reducing inflammation and encouraging fading.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAlthough scars are permanent,  there are ways that can reduce the risk of them being unsightly,\u201d says Dr Speron. \u201cWhat is important is to remember that depending on the size and location, scars can take a long time to heal, and that process is gradual, but with careful, consistent care, the scar  can fade into something that\u2019s less noticeable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Treatment for scars<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nNot all scars heal well, however. Whatever the reason, many people have scars that cause them problems. And there is a range of treatments available that can further minimize the appearance of scars.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are several non-surgical options to consider,\u201d Dr Speron explains. \u201cOptions like laser treatment, chemical peels, or microneedling, can all help to improve scar appearance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The best option will depend on the nature of the scar. Laser treatments, for example, can reduce the red appearance of scars, making them less noticeable. For smaller scars, such as those caused by acne, a chemical peel will help improve the skin\u2019s overall texture and smooth out the depths. Microneedling, which creates tiny punctures in the skin, helps to stimulate healing, making it effective for scarring from surgery and even burns.<\/p>\n<p>Be scar confident<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cMany people are afraid of scarring,\u201d says Dr Speron. \u201cBut actually, by recognizing a scar as part of healing, they will usually find that they can take action that will help it fade away. And, if it doesn\u2019t quite get there, there are still options we can consider.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dr Speron\u2019s advice is to take care of a scar just like any other part of the body. \u201cAlways consult a health professional, and get tailored solutions,\u201d he says. \u201cBut remember that, with good, consistent care, almost any scar can be managed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Sam Speron<br \/>Dr. Speron&#8217;s Natural Skin Care, LLC<br \/>+1 847-696-9900<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/724418579\" data-src=\"ZK5qAQ9tNNrKUoEK\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DrSperonsNaturalSkinCare\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/prplastic\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">X<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sam-speron-a1440519\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/drsperonsnaturalskincare\/?hl=en\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/samsperon\/videos\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@samsperon\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">TikTok<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=y_X04XW2Avrh6cK3&amp;i=ZK5qAQ9tNNrKUoEK\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      August 06, 2024, 15:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/724418579\/proper-care-of-a-scar-is-critical-to-its-healing-process-scar-support-treatment\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
