It integrates multiple sensors, communication networks, and intelligent technology to create a road environment that is responsive and well-informed. Numerous sensor technologies, such as cameras, radar, and lidar, are embedded within a road network to form the core of a Smart Highway. These sensors collect real-time data on the weather, road hazards, and traffic flow, allowing for prompt identification and resolution of any issues. These data are transmitted to a centralized control center, where they are analyzed and utilized to improve traffic management strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Smart highways employ communication networks that enable seamless interaction between vehicles, infrastructure, and traffic management systems. This enables accurate route recommendations, real-time traffic updates, and collision avoidance systems.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" height=\"406\" name=\"GNW_RichHtml_External_IMG\" src=\"https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/uploads\/reports\/1708438536-smart-highway-market.svg\" width=\"800\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Download Free Sample Report PDF @\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=BA-1oqwWQ5OFOUApBJ0g2CaOdv_ZQrpSmxz8ufd5xTuX537kymIYPXBaMeah3fWHSqnp_X6SBWIGeXuq-KVYvQAErw-5M4n8UYq0N-a9VasZ-w5grxd-t1OFuyoixGWSfm3Mal8pUWamI0dwb8tokgI1-aM7hd7z3jJ4O7UpNeYsCjkHYQC2XheIfsoDMPFR5Qr0mlo4NxyjKXRm-onnQHiMXsvpzAUDfuAuuJsTDQY=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/smart-highway-market\/request-sample<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Market Dynamics<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Rise in the Number of Vehicles Among Emerging Countries Drives the Global Market<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Annually, the number of new automobiles purchased by private consumers continues to increase. The substandard quality of the transportation infrastructure in many nations is the single most significant factor contributing to the increase in the number of automobiles purchased worldwide. Moreover, as a direct consequence of urbanization and globalization, individuals now have access to larger sums of money to invest in their initiatives. Due to the increased number of vehicles on the road, traffic is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate, especially in urban areas. Consequently, there has been an increase in the demand for intelligent highways and roads that can monitor the congestion on each road and reroute the traffic flow to make travel more productive and enjoyable.<\/p>\n<p><b>Rise in Advance Technology Among the Transportation Industry Creates Tremendous Opportunities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Electrification, renewable energy sources, and enhanced user safety have aided advanced technology development. The transportation industry has collaborated to develop a vast array of cutting-edge technologies, including wind-powered streetlights, solar-powered roads, and interactive illumination, all of which have contributed to creating smarter and safer streets. For instance, HP Lubricants and Leo Burnett India collaborated to design a system with &#8220;roads that honk.&#8221; This was the result of their productive collaboration. The &#8216;roads that honk&#8217; method involves strategically placing Smart Life poles before abrupt turns. These structures can communicate with and alert drivers of approaching vehicles. Other technologies, such as Electron&#8217;s electric charging lanes, self-healing concrete roads, and solar-paved highways, would present many development opportunities for the smart highway industry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Report Scope<\/strong><\/p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width:825px; border-collapse:collapse ;\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Study Period<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \"><strong>2019-2031<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">CAGR<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \"><strong>10.2%<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Historical Period<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \"><strong>2019-2021<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Forecast Period<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \"><strong>2023-2031<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Base Year<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \"><strong>2022<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Base Year Market Size<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \"><strong>USD 41.9 Billion<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Forecast Year<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \"><strong>2031<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Forecast Year Market Size<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \"><strong>USD 100.43 Billion<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Largest Market<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \"><strong>North America<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Fastest Growing Market<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \"><strong>Europe<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<p><b>Regional Analysis<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Asia-Pacific is the most significant\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=mStSKnL9z0XhxnffUz87fYgYafQKjVpQCbwAyZ-DCDXRpeoxkIs28nAlJdHCxFQRqMgCSiIn9YJkggMOaRZ2PAKKkOjUV9hgLWBmT3Jr5o_mYQZU0GP8MmO_M7Y_Xese4kfROhmjXZoascYQES3Dxk56ZNyzDr731BHXF7yBBcM=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">global smart highway market shareholder<\/a> and is estimated to exhibit a CAGR of 21.3% over the forecast period.
