Growing up in a tumultuous country and a Muslim home. In 1996, fleeing to America to escape violence. <\/p>\n<p>Given recent news headlines, IAM has intensified its efforts in raising awareness about <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/isikablaturk.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Christian persecution<\/a>, particularly in the Middle East and North African regions. I\u015f\u0131k herself has been vocal about the increasing threats and violence faced by Christians in these regions and has called for a global prayer movement in support of persecuted believers. From an evangelical viewpoint, she recognizes the need for new believers to be fully equipped in their new faith journey, as they often experience familial rejection and cultural hostility upon their decision to follow Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>I\u015f\u0131k Abla also emphasizes the importance of advocating for and standing up for Muslim-background Christian believers, who often face heightened persecution and discrimination during Ramadan. As the holy month concludes on April 9, she urges individuals and communities to show solidarity and support for these vulnerable individuals and to work towards promoting religious freedom and human rights.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, I\u015f\u0131k Abla stated, &#8220;My journey has taught me the importance of standing up for truth and justice. We cannot ignore the suffering of our brothers and sisters in Christ. It is imperative that we stand together in solidarity and prayer, advocate for their rights and safety, and extend the love of Jesus to individuals of all faiths and backgrounds.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As a Muslim background believer, she is uniquely positioned, knowing the culture, language, and social norms, to authentically and relationally share the Good News of Jesus Christ with Muslims. I\u015f\u0131k&#8217;s life experiences and faith journey significantly influence IAM\u2019s mission, propelling the organization\u2019s commitment to empower women, develop leaders, alleviate poverty, advocate for human rights from a biblical worldview, and share the hope of Jesus both locally and globally.<\/p>\n<p>She desires to see 1 Billion Muslims come to know Jesus. With over 16 years in ministry, she has become a global leader and speaker in over 200 nations. IAM reaches over 700 million individuals world-wide in multiple languages through various media platforms and outreach efforts, including Television, Social Media, Radio, church plants, and other preaching and teaching venues.<\/p>\n<p>About: I\u015eIK ABLA<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nIsik Abla was born in Istanbul, Turkey, and raised in a Muslim home. Throughout her life, she experienced verbal and physical abuse and found herself in a highly violent, abusive marriage.<\/p>\n<p>I\u015f\u0131k earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in literature and an advanced business degree. She worked in high-ranking executive positions for some of Turkey&#8217;s largest corporations and traveled throughout Europe.<\/p>\n<p>In 1996, she fled to America from violence.  After years of struggling to start her career all over again in a foreign country and failing in many areas of her personal life, I\u015f\u0131k fell into a deep depression. She became suicidal. On the day she was planning to end her life, she had a personal encounter with God. She completely surrendered her life to Jesus.<\/p>\n<p>From that moment on, her life remarkably changed for the better. After receiving the Lord\u2019s call to full-time ministry, she attended the Ambassador\u2019s Commission School of Ministry. Soon after her graduation, she became an ordained minister. She studied Biblical studies. Following she attended Yale and Harvard Universities for leadership training. <\/p>\n<p>Today, I\u015f\u0131k\u2019s programs are broadcast in multiple languages in over 200 countries on six continents and are available to more than 700 million people.<\/p>\n<p>Her message of hope, love, and redemption, found only in a loving God, resonates and continues to reach the Muslim world for Christ.  As a Muslim background believer, she is uniquely positioned, knowing the culture, language, and social norms, to authentically and relationally share the good news of Jesus Christ with Muslims.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Eden Hill<br \/>Eden Gordon Media, LLC<br \/>+1 202-714-6014<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/701073864\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=le-TP0nYOmbo7DzC&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      April 04, 2024, 14:30 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/701073864\/i-k-abla-ministries-iam-ignites-hope-empowerment-takes-stand-against-christian-persecution-worldwide\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
