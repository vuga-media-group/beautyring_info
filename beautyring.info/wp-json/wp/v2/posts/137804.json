These devices, also known as Last Mile Delivery (LMD) robots, are available in numerous sizes, shapes, and propulsion systems. Autonomous last-mile delivery utilizes autonomous vehicles to deliver the product or service to the customer&#8217;s door without human intervention. It ensures that the product is supplied to the consumer within the allotted time limit without endangering the business&#8217;s good name and status in the industry. Growing internet usage and the development of the e-commerce sector, which calls for a more effective way of getting the goods to the buyer, are driving the adoption of online shopping. In response, businesses have implemented a variety of product delivery methods, including the use of ground delivery trucks and drones.<\/p>\n<p><b>Download Free Sample Report PDF @ <\/b><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=uVOnCsiLqVnH-SYpdQUcfAPLh_SjCja2nh91H0VEUBFye7smGAoqnYGlG2StbMkAOjGkyNcQLig0td0v385cssF7_4gOKm4-0LehdR19P2IHK0gF-21b8dnVPMJoYeVDZ8A75nEkxdxgMlNR-xlooObTc5KPgjTAFnhDJwl9gWxyVlrBEwHNQlqnRV3lrYWGGDy2N8C6kFKLGjJjqmy5mYA80l1YzL_p2fya3GhfxL6ijPJc4FOc94b41iJing9bTlS-3_ZT8M2CWZC48AuRyg==\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b><u>https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/autonomous-last-mile-delivery-market\/request-sample<\/u><\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Increased Demand for Fast Delivery of Packages and Technological to Drive the Global <\/b><br \/><b>Autonomous Last Mile Delivery Market<\/b><\/p>\n<p>According to Straits Research, \u201cThe global autonomous last mile delivery market size was valued at USD 11.90 billion in 2021. It is expected to reach USD 84.90 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 24.4% during the forecast period (2022-2030).\u201d More effective and dependable delivery services are in demand due to the growth of online shopping and consumers&#8217; preference for buying goods from online retailers. The pandemic outbreak has increased customer demand for online delivery of daily necessities, contributing to the market growth for autonomous last-mile delivery. In China, for instance, the number of e-grocery orders has increased due to consumers&#8217; preference for online retailers such as JD.com, Alibaba Group, and MTDP. This was done to prevent people from interacting face-to-face during the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, JD.com in China established its autonomous robot delivery technology in Wuhan to handle grocery and medical package deliveries, reducing the need to avoid direct human contact. In addition, the demand for speedy package delivery has increased the use of various delivery methods, such as drones and autonomous vehicles, contributing to the global expansion of the autonomous last-mile delivery market.<\/p>\n<p><b>An Efficient Way to Deliver Packages to Create Global Autonomous Last Mile Delivery Market Opportunities<\/b><br \/>As there will be no need for human intervention at any point, it is believed that autonomous last-mile delivery services will be a cost-effective way to deliver packages in the future. Various businesses have implemented numerous innovations, such as incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into ground delivery robots, facilitating market expansion. In addition, the market for autonomous last-mile delivery is expanding due to developments in delivery robots in countries such as Germany and Denmark.
