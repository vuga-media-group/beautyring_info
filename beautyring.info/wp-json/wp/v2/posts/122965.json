While Dr. Dome is an expert in diversity, equity and inclusion, the book is not one-dimensional. Dr. Dome, an educator who boasts almost three decades of commitment to the education system in various capacities, said the book\u2019s resources can be applied to any complex discussion.<\/p>\n<p>The book is based on Dr. Dome\u2019s Compassionate Dialogue framework. This construct is a series of methods and skills that can be mastered to create a standardized, courageous, non-violent and non-aggressive stance to participating in dialogues.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Dome said she was inspired to write the book based on the traumatic and angering events that took place in the last few years. With racial injustices at a high and lines drawn in the sand, she recognized the growing inability of persons to have civil discourse with opposing points. \u201cThe book affirms that disagreements are a natural component of communicating,\u201d Dr. Dome said. \u201cHowever, with this book, the conversation will end with new knowledge gained by each party instead of an uproar.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Race (and Other Hard Things)\u201d has earned more than 50 five-star reviews on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about \u201cLet\u2019s Talk About Race (and Other Hard Things)\u201d or to purchase the book, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/LetsTalkAboutRaceAudiobook\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/bit.ly\/LetsTalkAboutRaceAudiobook<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Dr. Dome and her work, please visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/drnancydome.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">drnancydome.com<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>About Dr. Nancy Dome<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nRenowned speaker, author and equity consultant Dr. Nancy Dome co-founded Epoch Education in 2014 to provide leaders in education and business with accessible and professional development in diversity, inclusion and belonging, and equity.
