But now, in a phone call to his best friend Jason, the band\u2019s guitarist, Max declares he\u2019s ready to come back. Jason, who grew up alongside Max and tends to glamorize even his most self-serving eccentricities, is eager to reunite\u2014and desperate for a brighter future following a lonely summer punctuated by the violent rally that made his and Max\u2019s hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia the subject of national headlines. However, Tara, the band\u2019s drummer and voice of reason, is more skeptical of Max\u2019s apparent return\u2014especially since, as the opening show of their tour approaches, Max remains moody and withdrawn, even sending his brother Alex to events in his place.<\/p>\n<p>At a party to celebrate the start of their tour, tensions over Max\u2019s reclusive behavior flare between Jason and Tara, and later that night, chaos erupts as Alex\u2014who is standing in for Max\u2014and an unrelated lookalike are both attacked. Suddenly, the real Max is nowhere to be found\u2014sending Jason and his fellow band members spinning into a spiral of confusion that will leave Jason questioning everything from his sexuality to his sense of reality.<\/p>\n<p>An impressive, passionate debut novel as complex and rich as the town it portrays in loving detail, &#8216;Fireflies and Zeroes&#8217; was released on July 19, 2023.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;February 2018, Charlottesville, Virginia.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;The Generation is back\u2014finally. Over the course of a yearlong hiatus, the pop-punk trio has seen their beloved hometown rocked by racist violence and endured months of radio silence from their brilliant yet volatile front man, Max. But guitarist Jason is ready to put all of that behind him when a late-night call from Max reconnects the lifelong friends and reunites the band.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;At a party on the eve of the band\u2019s reunion tour, Jason watches in horror as Max is thrown to his death off a balcony\u2014or so he thinks. In the chaotic hours that follow, two things become clear: the victim on the balcony was an imposter, and\u2014as usual\u2014there are no simple answers when it comes to the real Max. He\u2019s just . . . gone.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Troubled by the emotional storms that drove Max away even before his disappearance, but desperate to bring him home, Jason resolves to find Max himself. In the long winter shadow of Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge, Jason sets out on a race against time to save his friend. In doing so, he unravels a series of surprising personal truths about the people and places he cares about most.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<\/p>\n<p>Liz Larson has spent half of her life in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the other half in State College, Pennsylvania.
