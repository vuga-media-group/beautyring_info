Today, that same spirit of collaboration is what fuels HCLT&#8217;s conservation efforts,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Julie Schodt<\/span>, Development Director for HCLT. &#8220;Partners like Chemist Spirits and Old Edwards Inn help remind those who love these mountains that each of us plays an important role in saving our wild places for the benefit of current and future generations.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;These mountains are part of one of only two temperate rain forests in the continental U.S. \u2013 full of amazing plants that grow only here, not to mention the animals that rely on them. We aim to help conserve these wildlands with the release of Old Edwards Discovery Gin,&#8221; says <span class=\"xn-person\">Debbie Word<\/span>, a <span class=\"xn-location\">Cashiers, North Carolina<\/span> landowner and HCLT supporter who co-founded Chemist Spirits in <span class=\"xn-location\">Asheville, North Carolina<\/span>, with her daughter <span class=\"xn-person\">Danielle Donaldson<\/span> in 2018. &#8220;Every bottle is a celebration of the diverse flora and fauna that thrive in this breathtaking corner of the United States.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The award-winning culinary and beverage team at Old Edwards has worked closely with Chemist Spirits to refine the unique flavor profile of the gin to meet Old Edwards&#8217; exceptional standards of sustainability and quality. &#8220;We consider ourselves custodians of this unique and beautiful natural environment where, for nearly two centuries, travelers have come from around the world to rest and recharge,&#8221; says Executive Chef, <span class=\"xn-person\">Chris Huerta<\/span>. &#8220;Old Edwards is proud to co-create a premium spirit that aligns with our commitment to sustainability and preservation while also providing an avenue to support the Highlands-Cashiers Land Trust with every exquisite pour.&#8221;\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Old Edwards Inn is the first hospitality provider in <span class=\"xn-location\">North Carolina<\/span> to be awarded the NC Green Travel Award by the North Carolina Division of Environmental Assistance and Outreach (NCDEAO) and the Center of Sustainable Tourism at <span class=\"xn-org\">East Carolina University<\/span>. In 2016, Old Edwards Inn&#8217;s rating was raised to NC Green Travel&#8217;s highest rating and each year they continue to seek out new ways to further protect the natural resources of <span class=\"xn-location\">North Carolina<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><b>Old Edwards Discovery Gin Tasting Notes<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Native <span class=\"xn-location\">Highlands<\/span> juniper blended with other distinctive botanicals crafts a gin that is a true homage to the region it hails from while sweet birch bark lends a subtly minty freshness, intertwined with the gentle resinous notes from native hemlock. Pitch Pine adds a whisper of earthiness, balanced by the soft floral caress of Multiflora Rose. The Local Juniper shines through with its timeless piney essence, harmoniously melding with the sweet, delicate touch of local sourwood honey. These botanicals come together to create a gin that is lightweight, refreshing and botanical-forward, offering a crisp, clean taste with every sip. Old Edwards Discovery gin doesn&#8217;t just speak of its place of origin but sings of it, each note a tribute to the breathtaking yet rugged landscapes that cradle these botanical treasures.<\/p>\n<p><b>About Old Edwards Hospitality Group<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Old Edwards Hospitality Group is a leisure and lifestyle company in <span class=\"xn-location\">Highlands, N.C.<\/span>, an upscale resort town atop the southwestern plateau of <span class=\"xn-location\">North Carolina&#8217;s<\/span> Blue Ridge Mountains in the Nantahala National Forest.
