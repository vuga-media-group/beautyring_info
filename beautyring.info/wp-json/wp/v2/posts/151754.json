Technology is disrupting the established market with the advent of web-based booking and the use of AI and IoT in operation optimizations. Technology-driven players such as online booking hotel aggregators and metasearch engines, have heavily invested in big data analytics to make analytics-driven business decisions to offer accommodations such as capsule hotels that are cheap, equipped with basic amenities, facilitate single night and hourly basis stay, and others.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, the affordability of capsule hotels plays a crucial role in driving the growth of the market. In an era where travelers are increasingly budget-conscious, these compact accommodations offer an attractive alternative to traditional hotels, which can often be expensive. By providing a basic yet comfortable sleeping space at a fraction of the cost of a standard hotel room, capsule hotels appeal to a wide range of budget travelers, including backpackers, solo adventurers, and budget-conscious business travelers.<\/p>\n<p><b>Report Coverage &amp;
