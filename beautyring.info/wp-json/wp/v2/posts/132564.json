As part of the campaign, Judd and Edwards lit up New York City&#8217;s Times Square in a call-to-action billboard to \u201cSee The Signs &amp; Act To End It,\u201d in addition to launching digital displays across Miami and in LA, and accompanied by an online social media campaign, guiding people on how to seek help and support.<\/p>\n<p>Both Ashley and Anthony endured sexual abuse as children and have also lived through the devastating mental health struggles in their own adulthoods and those of loved ones. Today, they live in healing and are examples of resilience and hope for those struggling with their own history of abuse.<\/p>\n<p>The END1IN4 campaign launched in September National Suicide Prevention Month to draw attention to the tragedy that those who experience child sexual abuse are up to five times more likely to attempt suicide. On average in the United States, reports show that as many as one in four children (one in three girls and one in five boys) will experience child sexual abuse. Of all perpetrators, 93 percent are within or close to the family. These statistics are commonly regarded as underreported. The campaign aims to highlight that child sexual abuse is \u201ccloser to home,\u201d more prevalent than most people think, and with outcomes more tragic than many know.<\/p>\n<p>The billboards and digital displays place key questions on center stage, including \u201cYour Child. Acting Out or Sexually Abused?\u201d and \u201cYour Child. A Loner or Sexually Abused?\u201d The campaign encourages the general public to \u201cSee The Signs\u201d and \u201cAct To End It,\u201d and highlights that there are \u201c42 Million Strong Survivors.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Ashley and Anthony also created video messages of encouragement that launched on social media with the hashtags #ActToEndIt, #END1IN4 and #ChildrenAreNotForSex.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe need the general public to see the signs and act for children who are often too traumatized and manipulated to self-report sexual abuse\u2014especially when the abuse is often in or close to the family,\u201d encourages Ashley Judd. \u201cThe signs in child victims and in adult survivors who struggle with mental health are often very clear. The problem is that we too often fail to act because we don\u2019t want to see it and don\u2019t know what to do to end it.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Tragically, in 2022, Ashley\u2019s mother Naomi, who experienced child sexual abuse, took her own life, succumbing to the disease of mental illness after many years of struggle. Ashley was sexually abused by a man for the first time in the second grade and shared, \u201cI had the onset of childhood depression at that time, with the attendant symptoms and grief.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Anthony Edwards shares that he was sexually abused when he was 14 by someone he trusted and viewed as a father figure. \u201cThe shame of feeling responsible for something that was done to you can feel like a good reason to keep quiet and stay silent. Find the words. It\u2019s hard, it can be uncomfortable, but it\u2019s okay to talk about it,\u201d encourages Edwards in a video message that he recorded for the campaign. Edwards is also Board Chair of 1in6, a non-profit organization that helps men who have had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences to live healthier, happier lives. <\/p>\n<p>The campaign helps the general public to see the signs and to know what to do by directing people to the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.end1in4.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">END1IN4.org<\/a> web site, which includes information on common signs, links to local and national resources, and hotline numbers, including an easy recall hotline, (240) END-1IN4 that directs all calls to the 24-hour Childhelp National Child Abuse hotline. The campaign also seeks to encourage victims to reach out for help and support. <\/p>\n<p>The campaign launched on &#8220;The Cube,&#8221; a full-motion billboard in New York\u2019s Times Square, on September 22 for a one-day feature. The campaign will run for one month on more than 100 digital outdoor displays in Miami, on the Rosecrans Avenue &amp; San Diego Freeway billboards in L.A., and also ongoing across social media.<\/p>\n<p>END1IN4, Inc. Founder, Kathy Andersen, also a survivor of child sexual abuse expressed, \u201cWe need people to know that child sexual abuse is closer to them than they think\u201493 percent of abusers are in or known to the family; and 1 in 4 children will suffer child sexual abuse. This is everyone\u2019s problem, and it\u2019s very likely among your family and friends. This campaign aims to help people to see the signs and know what to do to act to end it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The END1IN4 campaign in Miami is funded in part by The Children\u2019s Trust. The Children\u2019s Trust is a dedicated source of revenue established by voter referendum to improve the lives of children and families in Miami-Dade County.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT END1IN4, Inc. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nEND1IN4, Inc. is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization with a mission to end the impact and magnitude of child sexual abuse through breakthrough public awareness and engagement campaigns, education, and advocacy.
