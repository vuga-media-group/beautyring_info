The body was laid out in a ritual fashion after she had been strangled and an ice pick was thrust into her brain. The book is the first comprehensive account of what happened on that fatal night and what led to the eventual solving of the case 44 years later.<\/p>\n<p>A native of Bismarck, North Dakota, Arlis was the deeply religious wife of Stanford sophomore, Bruce Perry. She had gone into the church to pray late on Saturday evening following a dispute with her husband. Detectives pursued serial killers like Ted Bundy and David Berkowitz but the case was not solved until 2018 when advanced DNA was able to identify the suspect.  When the cold-case detectives showed up at the suspect\u2019s home and knocked on the door, the suspect shot himself in the head.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/murderundergodseye.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">\u201cMurder Under God\u2019s Eye\u201d<\/a> is both a detailed whodunit and an exploration of the impact the case had on the campus and the broader community. \u201cNo one knows more about the murder of Arlis Perry inside Stanford Memorial Church than reporter Scott Herhold,\u201d said retired Stanford police Captain, Raoul K. Niemeyer. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating chronology of a diabolical crime.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The title of the book is taken from a fresco of a huge eye painted by Jane Stanford in the church\u2019s tower when the sanctuary was completed in 1903.

Herhold became interested in the crime after he joined the newspaper\u2019s Peninsula bureau in 1977 while the case was still fresh. Herhold gave a speech about the still-unsolved crime at a Palo Alto Historical Association meeting in 2017,  before retiring later that year. In 2003, Herhold was a finalist for the George Polk Award in Journalism &#8211; a series of American journalism awards presented annually by Long Island University in New York. The award judges place a premium on investigative work that is original, requires digging and resourcefulness and brings results.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Elaine Sullivan<br \/>SullivanWorks<br \/>+1 (408) 375 0305<br \/>elaine@sullivanworks.com<br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/profile.php?id=100092548428954\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/murderundergod\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/murderundergodseye\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@murder_under_god_eye\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=cst0ZowbVITC_LYt&amp;i=UJqgwUQdmhSNn_Ye\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      May 24, 2023, 13:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/635510352\/former-san-jose-mercury-news-reporter-releases-book-about-brutal-murder-of-19-year-old-stanford-resident-arlis-perry\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
