Based on the survey, this could be attributed to Japanese workers taking more frequent, short vacations and prioritizing relaxation during their getaways.<\/li>\n<li><b>France:\u00a0<\/b>No one vacations quite like the French, taking the most days off in the world (29) and 2.5x more than Americans. There&#8217;s an emphasis culturally on the fundamental right to rest as more French workers view vacations as a basic right (93% vs 83% of U.S.).<\/li>\n<li><b><span class=\"xn-location\">Hong Kong<\/span>:<\/b>\u00a0Hong Kong was the only market surveyed where respondents didn&#8217;t leave vacation days unused but took\u00a0<i>more\u00a0<\/i>time off on average than they were allocated, and 15% vow to do it again in 2024 (highest globally).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&#8220;We may not be able to control how many days off we get, but the research begs the question: What can we learn from other countries that will help Americans break this horrible habit of not using the time off we\u00a0<i>do<\/i>\u00a0have, said <span class=\"xn-person\">Melanie Fish<\/span>, head of Expedia Group brands public relations. &#8220;In Japan, people take time off every month instead of just twice a year. For the French, not even a full month of vacation feels like enough time. Clearly there&#8217;s a lot for the U.S. to borrow from, whether it&#8217;s spreading your PTO throughout the year or prioritizing rest on your next vacation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>View the full 2024 Vacation Deprivation Report on the\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4195600-1&amp;h=3742543842&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.expedia.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fexpedia-report-finds-americans-win-the-gold-medal-for-taking-fewest-vacation-days-globally%2F&amp;a=Expedia+Newsroom\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Expedia Newsroom<\/a>.
