It&#8217;s a feeling so strong it even has a name, The Aruba Effect. That&#8217;s why this International Day of Happiness, <span class=\"xn-location\">Aruba<\/span> wants to encourage those across the globe to take a lesson in the Language of Happiness. How? By releasing the island&#8217;s first-ever educational video outlining five simple lessons so everyone can become fluent in happiness.<\/p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><b>Gratitude: <\/b>Ask yourself, &#8220;What am I thankful for?&#8221; Whether it&#8217;s the people in your life, your health or nature itself, find a way to express gratitude. In <span class=\"xn-location\">Aruba<\/span> they simply say &#8220;Masha Danki.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li><b>Wellness:<\/b>\u00a0It&#8217;s difficult to care for others without first caring for ourselves. From work-life balance to exercise and relaxation, don&#8217;t forget to take care of you.<\/li>\n<li><b>Community<\/b>: Home to approximately 100 different nationalities, <span class=\"xn-location\">Aruba<\/span> knows the value of community &#8211; a sense of belonging that keeps us connected. Joining a community and welcoming others, speaks happiness through inclusion.<\/li>\n<li><b>Kindness: <\/b>Kindness is happiness in action, as Arubans know all too well. The kindness you receive becomes the kindness you share.<\/li>\n<li><b>Growth: <\/b>Stay curious \u2013 because curiosity leads to growth. Open yourself to happiness that you may otherwise have never known and share it with others.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>To share the five lessons behind the Language of Happiness far and wide, ATA partnered with those who are most fluent, travelers who recently felt the Aruba Effect, to share the video with their audience of jetsetters. Because no matter where you&#8217;re from, or visiting around the world, there&#8217;s only one truly universal language.<\/p>\n<p>Want to learn more?
