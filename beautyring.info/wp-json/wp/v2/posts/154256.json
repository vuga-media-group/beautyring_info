In April 2024, Tiger Aesthetics acquired the Sientra brand after Sientra, Inc. declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Tiger Aesthetics has honored and deepened the Mission Plasticos partnership with a 5-year commitment to continue funding the Reshaping Lives: Full Circle collaboration.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTiger Aesthetics will build on the positive legacy that Sientra created in this industry, and we are committed to giving back to the community, starting with our support of Mission Plasticos\u2019 Reshaping Lives: Full Circle initiative,\u201d co-CEO of Tiger Aesthetics, Oliver Burckhardt. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to forge a long-term, stable partnership with Mission Plasticos to impact care for patients in need and provide women access to life-changing breast reconstruction procedures.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tiger Aesthetics will work with Mission Plasticos to continue to recruit board-certified volunteer surgeons across the United States to join the +100 surgeons already committed to the program. The company will also provide its silicone gel breast implants, which have an unrivaled safety profile and are clinically shown to have low complication rates1, and its one-of-a-kind breast tissue expanders, which are used to form a new breast pocket that will eventually hold the long-term breast implant, at no cost for qualified women enrolled in the program. Mission Plasticos will then pair those surgeons with appropriate local patients and coordinate their care at no cost to the patient. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt Mission Plasticos, we are driven by the belief that every woman deserves a full journey of care, regardless of her economic situation, and we are excited to partner with an industry leader that shares this belief,\u201d said Susan Williamson, Executive Director of Mission Plasticos. &#8220;Thanks to Tiger Aesthetics\u2019 long-term re-commitment and empowering donation, together we can continue to focus on closing the gaps in care for breast cancer survivors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to one study in 2017 that examined the influence of health insurance coverage on the use of immediate breast reconstruction in working-age women with breast cancer, breast reconstruction among women with private insurance was more than 3 times greater than among women on Medicaid2, and other barriers to obtaining the procedure include rural location, more severe breast cancer, and greater age3. The Reshaping Lives: Full Circle, initiative aims to help women in America experiencing these barriers to access a full journey of care.
