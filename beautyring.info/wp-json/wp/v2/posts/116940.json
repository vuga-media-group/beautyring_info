Creative Director (Lydia Querian) started Daily Malong&#039;s journey due to a growing interest of the Pilipinx community in indigenous culture and heritage. Lydia saw the opportunity between the diaspora&#039;s needs for cultural identity and the indigenous Filipinos&#039; need to keep the living traditions. Daily Malong provides the North American market with a supply of fashionable clothing pieces that use artisan textiles and materials. The pieces can be casual and formal wear, which easily fall under the categories of high fashion, sustainable, and slow fashion. As a social enterprise, Daily Malong takes pride in providing livelihood to indigenous communities in the Philippines through an ethical supply chain, bridging the gap between both spectrums of the diaspora and the homeland. &quot;Bringing indigenous weaving practices to the future perpetuates time-tested traditions, helping the present and protecting the future,&quot; said Querian. &quot;Each indigenous textile worn today helps wearers and weavers navigate societal atrocities, prevent climate change, and restore a more sustainable environment.&quot; The show is ready to set another groundbreaking fashion display at the Rooftop of The Edison at Time Square on September 10, 2022, at 5:00 PM EST in partnership with hiTechMODA. hiTechMODA is a brand that promotes fashion brands focused on environmental causes, sustainability, and inclusivity, which is in line with Daily Malong&#039;s values.

Keeping their momentum from last year's debut in New York Fashion Week, Daily Malong once again champions Filipino Indigenous weaving through intentional pieces that will set the future of Pilipinx fashion in the diaspora. With the overarching theme of \"Royalty is Indigenous,\" the collection and its theme embody the soul of traditional weaving and designs that are rooted in the pre-colonial era of the Philippines. The pre-colonial Philippines is considered the golden age of ingenuity. The new collection flaunts intricate artisan hand-woven pieces, which were adorned by pre-colonial tribal leaders, master artists, shamans and other important roles in communities called barangay or balangay. The vibrant prints and designs represent strength, solidarity, and tradition that embody the true regal spirit of the culture. Daily Malong is pivoting the conversation around indigeneity into the present and future by showcasing pieces that show the true essence of less tapped Filipino culture that is reminiscent of artistry beyond the more common Manila-centric and post colonial narrative. Expect to see empowered silhouettes and strobes of colors as the handwoven fabrics meld into modern ensembles. Creative Director (Lydia Querian) started Daily Malong's journey due to a growing interest of the Pilipinx community in indigenous culture and heritage. Lydia saw the opportunity between the diaspora's needs for cultural identity and the indigenous Filipinos' need to keep the living traditions. Daily Malong provides the North American market with a supply of fashionable clothing pieces that use artisan textiles and materials. The pieces can be casual and formal wear, which easily fall under the categories of high fashion, sustainable, and slow fashion. As a social enterprise, Daily Malong takes pride in providing livelihood to indigenous communities in the Philippines through an ethical supply chain, bridging the gap between both spectrums of the diaspora and the homeland. \"Bringing indigenous weaving practices to the future perpetuates time-tested traditions, helping the present and protecting the future,\" said Querian. \"Each indigenous textile worn today helps wearers and weavers navigate societal atrocities, prevent climate change, and restore a more sustainable environment.\" The show is ready to set another groundbreaking fashion display at the Rooftop of The Edison at Time Square on September 10, 2022, at 5:00 PM EST in partnership with hiTechMODA. hiTechMODA is a brand that promotes fashion brands focused on environmental causes, sustainability, and inclusivity, which is in line with Daily Malong's values.
