In conjunction with the New First Lien Term Loan, and subject to market and other conditions, the Company may raise <span class=\"xn-money\">$500 million<\/span> of other secured debt maturing in 2029 (together with the New First Lien Term Loan, the &#8220;Refinancing Transactions&#8221;). The Company intends to use the proceeds from the Refinancing Transactions to repay a portion of the borrowings under the Company&#8217;s existing first-priority senior secured term loan facility maturing in 2025.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>After the closing of the Refinancing Transactions, the Company intends to redeem all of the Company&#8217;s 10.500% second-priority senior secured notes due 2026 and 10.125% second-priority senior secured notes due 2026 (collectively, the &#8220;2026 Notes&#8221;), saving over <span class=\"xn-money\">$120 million<\/span> in interest expense on an annualized basis. The <span class=\"xn-money\">$1.2 billion<\/span> of redemptions will be conditioned on the closing of the Refinancing Transactions. The Company expects to use cash on hand to finance the redemptions. This press release does not constitute a notice of redemption with respect to the 2026 Notes.<\/p>\n<p>The Company&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer <span class=\"xn-person\">David Bernstein<\/span> commented: &#8220;Given the confidence we have in our business and its cash flow generation, we plan to retire <span class=\"xn-money\">$1.2 billion<\/span> of our highest cost debt.\u00a0 In connection with this retirement, we plan to extend some of the lowest cost public debt in our portfolio. This is yet another step forward in our deleveraging journey, building on the <span class=\"xn-money\">$1.4 billion<\/span> we already early retired this year. With this debt repayment, we now expect our year end debt balance to be less than <span class=\"xn-money\">$32.0 billion<\/span>, an improvement over the \u00a0November 30, 2023 debt balance of less than <span class=\"xn-money\">$33.0 billion<\/span> provided in our June guidance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to purchase any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any state or jurisdiction in which such offering, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.<\/p>\n<p><b>About Carnival Corporation &amp; plc<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Carnival Corporation &amp; plc is \u00a0the \u00a0largest global cruise company, and among the largest leisure travel companies, with a portfolio of world-class leading cruise lines &#8211; AIDA Cruises, \u00a0Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Cunard, Holland America Line, P&amp;O Cruises (<span class=\"xn-location\">Australia<\/span>), P&amp;O Cruises (UK), Princess Cruises and Seabourn.<\/p>\n<p><b>Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc and their respective subsidiaries are referred to collectively in this press release, as &#8220;Carnival Corporation &amp; plc,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;we.&#8221; Some of the statements, estimates or projections contained in this press release are &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions with respect to us, including some statements concerning the refinancing transactions described herein, future results, operations, outlooks, plans, goals, reputation, cash flows, liquidity and other events which have not yet occurred.
