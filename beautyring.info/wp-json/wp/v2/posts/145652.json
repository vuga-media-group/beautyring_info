He states that even when patients diligently brush their teeth, floss, and attend check-ups, they often overlook the profound role that a healthy diet plays in overall oral function. <\/p>\n<p>As Dr. Sweeney has discussed in his \u201cWisdom Wednesday\u201d series of YouTube videos, patients can improve their dental health by making informed dietary choices. For instance, calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and vitamin K are crucial for building and maintaining strong tooth enamel, the protective outer layer of teeth that shields them from decay and damage. This means, Dr. Sweeney continues, that patients should incorporate foods like dairy products, fruits, and vegetables into their diet as often as possible. Additionally, patients can encourage dental as well as full-body wellness by drinking sufficient water.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, Dr. Sweeney notes that patients should be wary of certain foods and drinks \u2013 especially items that are high in sugar. Hard candies and sodas can contribute to low PH levels, which can in turn cause bacteria to develop in the mouth and lead to <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.austindentalspa.com\/periodontal-austin-tx\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">gum disease<\/a>. Dr. Sweeney also mentions that alcoholic beverages can dry out the mouth and damage enamel.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, Dr. Sweeney explains that being mindful of the link between dental health and nutrition can contribute to a brighter, healthier smile. He also advises patients to visit oral health professionals who offer <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.austindentalspa.com\/dental-care-services\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">comprehensive dental services<\/a>, as these dentists can form meaningful connections with patients while monitoring their overall oral wellness.<\/p>\n<p>About Mark Sweeney, DDS<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFor four and a half decades, Dr. Mark Sweeney has provided Austin patients with the full spectrum of dental treatments. An alumnus of the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Texas Health Science Center Dental School, Dr. Sweeney has earned a number of accolades throughout his career, including Austin American-Statesman\u2019s \u201cBest Dentist\u201d award. Additionally, he is affiliated with professional organizations such as the American Dental Association (ADA) and the American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry (AACD), and is one of the founders of the Texas Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry.
