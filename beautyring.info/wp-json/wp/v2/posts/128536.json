Merchants can securely install the connector directly from the marketplace to connect their product data with their Searchspring account. The connector has been certified by Magento and is available immediately. <\/p>\n<p>The company has also added functionality to the existing Klaviyo integration. In addition to sending targeted and dynamic product recommendations to shoppers through email, merchants can now use the same integration to add product recommendations in text (SMS) messages. <\/p>\n<p>Searchspring rebuilt its site reporting and merchandising tools to use the data and inputs from GA4. Merchants that are used to using Google data with Searchspring can continue doing so to understand the differences among shoppers that use site search and shoppers that do not. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur mid-year enhancements are a direct result of feedback from clients and partners,\u201d said Suhas Gudihal, Chief Technology Officer at Searchspring. \u201cOur product and development teams are laser focused on solving the most critical problems for our clients, specifically ensuring that the shopping experience is second-to-none.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>About Searchspring<br \/>Searchspring is the global leading <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/searchspring.com\/solutions\/ecommerce-site-search\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">ecommerce search<\/a> and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/searchspring.com\/solutions\/ecommerce-personalization\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">personalization platform<\/a> that enables merchants with powerful, unique, proven product discovery and shopping experiences since 2007.
