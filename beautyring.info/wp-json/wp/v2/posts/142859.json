Whether it\u2019s Texas or Russia, the Roman or British empires, Nazi Germany, Iran, Saudi Arabia, China, or the Taliban, the built-in reason to repress sex and control women and reproductive rights is to increase frustration and sex on the wrong brain in the men authoritarian leaders need to serve them.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to the theory SOWB is caused when impatient satisfaction-demanding reproductive urges are used to fuel left brain-dominant thinking that is supposed to be patient and objective.<\/p>\n<p>Website <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sexonthewrongbrain.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">sexonthewrongbrain.com<\/a> describes three major symptoms:<br \/>\u2022\tWhen reproductive energy fuels mental processes such as problem solving and logic it pushes for quick easy answers, premature conclusion, and the closure of certainty<br \/>\u2022\tWhen reproductive energy associates with numbers, math, and measurement it wants more, bigger, faster, and that increases greed and materialism<br \/>\u2022\tSince reproductive energy is diverted and used for unrelated purposes it can increase sexual dysfunction<\/p>\n<p>The website points out that authoritarianism is sometimes measured with the Uncertainty Avoidance Index. It introduces the Certainty Deficit Disorder (CDD) and blames it for a wide spectrum of extreme and anti-democratic behavior motivated by an irrational need for certainty and a corresponding fear of uncertainty.<\/p>\n<p>This certainty\/uncertainty dynamic is used to explain authoritarianism:<br \/>\u2022\tAs the need for certainty and closure increases so does fear of uncertainty, change, diversity, unpredictability, and nature<br \/>\u2022\tCertainty is more important than truth<br \/>\u2022\tLeaders must be certain, confident, decisive, and always right and their followers interpret that as intelligence and strength<br \/>\u2022\tTo create certainty, authoritarian leaders and ideologies offer order and control and simplify the world into absolutes &#8211; black or white, right or wrong, good or evil &#8211; which fuels intolerance, bigotry, hate, extremism, and radicalism<br \/>\u2022\tComplicated uncertainty-producing problems like global warming are denied, ignored, and simplified<br \/>\u2022\tAs chaos and uncertainty increase so does the value of the certitude projected by autocratic leaders and their symbols<\/p>\n<p>The website claims that associating sex with punishment and guilt helps authoritarian societies establish thought patterns that divert reproductive energy to reward creation and rationalization of non-existent certainty and that can make lying, denial, and hypocrisy feel good, as well as contribute to sexual dysfunction.<\/p>\n<p>Sex on the wrong brain theory:<br \/>\u2022\tSuggests a broad range of evolutionary implications and possibilities for research<br \/>\u2022\tLists numerous factors that influence SOWB levels, including heredity, gender, libido, frustration, etc.<br \/>\u2022\tExplains why females generally have less SOWB<br \/>\u2022\tClaims SOWB can worsen with age as SOWB-based thought patterns become more established and as opportunity for real sex diminishes<br \/>\u2022\tSuggests people descended from older civilizations tend to have more SOWB and may view people with less SOWB as inferior or threatening, contributing to misogyny and bigotry<br \/>\u2022\tSuggests culture, social stratification, discrimination, and religion have been used to increase SOWB<br \/>\u2022\tSuggests SOWB could be a trigger for violence and mental illness<br \/>\u2022\tClaims SOWB explains why human ancestors evolved from 50% to 90% right handed<br \/>\u2022\tClaims SOWB levels were low for 99% of human evolution but increased significantly in recent centuries in heavily populated areas as civilizations began to increase sexual repression<br \/>\u2022\tSuggests there may be implications for artificial intelligence<\/p>\n<p>To reach a wider audience the book and a screenplay weave the SOWB theory and implications into a science fiction adventure comedy set in a near future threatened by global warming.
