The music seed was planted after the three-year-old heard Elvis Presley sing &#8220;I&#8217;m All Shook Up.&#8221;  Elwood, known by his friends and family as &#8220;Woody&#8221; was strolling down the aisle in a grocery store with his parents after listening to Elvis sing on the car radio.  It was Woody&#8217;s first time hearing the song, and as he strolled the aisle, toddler Woody blurted out the words, &#8220;I&#8217;m All Shook Off.&#8221;  His Mom stopped dead in her tracks, looked at his Dad and said, &#8220;I think we have a singer in the family.&#8221;  Both parents were entertainers.  Woody&#8217;s mom was in theater, and his dad was a trumpet player and leader of a band during the Big Band Swing Era. There was no doubt the music gene was in Woody&#8217;s DNA.<\/p>\n<p>Born and raised in Reading, Pennsylvania offered Woody many opportunities for the Vocalist\/Bassist to perform and travel.  In 2016, Woody was inducted into the Berks County Pennsylvania Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.  In 2017, Woody began participating in open mic performances and jams throughout Coachella Valley, California, and he played bass guitar and sang with local bands and musicians. Performing the feel-good sounds of the swinging 60&#8217;s was always Woody&#8217;s desire, and in 2019, he teamed with two longtime friends, Drummer James St James and Guitarist Jerry Steelfox to form an early 60&#8217;s rock band called SAINTSTEELWOOD<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>.  In 2024, to meet the demands of a growing list of performances, the name of the band was changed to Woody &amp; The Retros.  Today, Woody &amp; The Retros continue to play the early 60&#8217;s genre of niche tunes and &#8220;Feel Good Sounds of the Swingin&#8217; 60&#8217;s&#8221; throughout Southern California&#8217;s Desert Cities and beyond.  A patron recently stated, &#8220;This band is the best.  I can&#8217;t sit still. I&#8217;m moving in my seat.  I&#8217;m even up on the dance floor.  That doesn&#8217;t happen very often.&#8221;  <\/p>\n<p>Book Woody &amp; The Retros for your next event, private party or venue.  <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nEmail:  stormingstartups2016@gmail.com<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nVoicemail:  760-980-1435 <\/p>\n<p>Social media makes it easy to keep in touch with Woody &amp; The Retros: <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/woodyandtheretros\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Visit Woody &amp; The Retros Facebook Page<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo\/?fbid=6823216454391030&amp;set=a.433973186648754\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">See Woody &amp; The Retros Performance Schedule on Facebook<\/a> <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/woodyandtheretros\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Like &amp; Follow Woody &amp; The Retros on Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Storming Startups!<br \/>+1 760-980-1435<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/713935591\/mailto:stormingstartups2016@gmail.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">stormingstartups2016@gmail.com<\/a><br \/>Anna Miller<br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/woodyandtheretros\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/woody.retro\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Woody &amp; The Retros (formerly SAINTSTEELWOOD) at Palm Desert, California Country Club <\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"V6t6ItbYDwI\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"SAINTSTEELWOOD AT PALM DESERT COUNTRY CLUB\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/V6t6ItbYDwI?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=s-uVa8XCFN5vNhUC&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      May 23, 2024, 19:59 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/713935591\/woody-the-retros-bring-the-swinging-60-s-to-coachella-valley-california\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
