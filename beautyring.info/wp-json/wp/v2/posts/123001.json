The largest electronics and home company in Singapore at the time had him in charge of digital marketing and e-commerce. As a stroke survivor, he wanted to make a difference in someone\u2019s life through his own journey, with the hope of providing a positive outlook as one navigates everyday life. His first book, A Cry in the Dark, is about the author dealing with the aftermath of a stroke. After the launch of his first book, he was invited to speak at the World Stroke Congress 2022 in Singapore, where he shared his insights on health professionals impacting his recovery. This second book features stroke survivors sharing the individual stories of their own journeys.
