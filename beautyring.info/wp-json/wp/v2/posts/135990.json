But far from faddish, there\u2019s one superhero staple that has remained relatively under the radar and is now earning well-deserved buzz: enzymes.We all have heard of physical and chemical exfoliants \u2013 now meet their less famous cousin, enzyme exfoliants! You\u2019ll find them in popular products, like OM Botanical <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ombotanical.com\/product\/one-step-face-cleanser\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">One Step Face Cleanser<\/a> or <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ombotanical.com\/product\/enzyme-recovery-mask-pumpkin-spice\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Pumpkin and Spice Enzyme Recovery Mask<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>An exfoliant is a product which helps detach the outer layers of the skin. Physical exfoliants do this by buffing away at the surface like sandpaper, and chemical exfoliants do this by breaking apart the glue holding the cells together. Enzyme exfoliants are a bit more like regular chemical exfoliants, but there are some key differences.<\/p>\n<p>WHAT\u2019S IN AN ENZYME EXFOLIANT?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nEnzymes are proteins that perform a specific job. Simply put, for those who haven\u2019t thought about biochemistry for a while, enzymes enhance a particular chemical process. \u201cEssentially they act as catalysts for a reaction,\u201d explains Sudhir Shah the chief scientist at OM Botanical,<\/p>\n<p>Often derived from plants and fruits, enzymes set in motion a specific\u2014and critical\u2014skin-care reaction: They unglue the bonds between dead skin cells, which causes skin to exfoliate and slough off. And here\u2019s the unique part: Enzymes do this without disrupting the pH balance, the precise equilibrium that skin requires to perform at its best.<\/p>\n<p>This point of difference matters\u2014a lot. Unlike chemical acids that have the potential to burn or weaken your protective barrier and destroy skin microbiome, enzymes are unlikely to inflame, irritate, or damage skin. And with all the recent talk about preserving a healthy microbiome and nurturing skin rather than stripping it, consider enzymes a kinder, equally effective alternative for brightening and toning. <\/p>\n<p>The enzymes used for exfoliation in skincare are protease (or proteolytic) enzymes, which break down other proteins, including those keeping your older, outer layers of skin stuck on. In particular, they\u2019ll usually be bromelain from pineapple, papain from papaya or pumpkin enzyme.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMoreover, enzyme exfoliants tend to be gentler\u201d. Shah continues, \u201cThe enzyme extracts usually have some anti-inflammatory properties, making them particularly good for sensitive skin. Additionally, the enzymes are stable over a wide pH range, which means they don\u2019t need to be as acidic and harsh as Alpha-hydroxy acids and Beta-hydroxy Acids to work\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT OM BOTANICAL: Based in Apex, North Carolina, OM Botanical is committed to making the safest and the most effective plant based skin care line.
