said <span class=\"xn-person\">Alex Miller<\/span>, Founder and CEO of Upgraded Points. &#8220;Our latest study offers insight into the balance Americans strike when traveling with their pets, and what non-pet owning travelers think about it all, too.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>Study Methodology<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The study was conducted in September of 2023 and surveyed 1,000 Americans who regularly travel, asking questions on pet travel preferences of pet owners and non-pet owners alike towards pet-friendly flights and accommodations. Although a small minority report having flown with their pets, a whopping 85% of pet owners have faced travel challenges or restrictions when they do.<\/p>\n<p><b>Inflight Pet Passengers and Furry Encounters<\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>One-third (34%) of non-pet owners are uncomfortable sharing cabin space with other people&#8217;s pets.<\/li>\n<li>Generally, pet owners prefer to drive: 70% of pet owners would rather road trip with their pet for 8 hours than take a 2-hour flight.<\/li>\n<li>When they fly, pet owners typically leave their pet in their carrier: 26% let their pet out of its carrier while flying on a plane, while 59% leave it in a carrier the whole trip.<\/li>\n<li>57% of non-pet owners would rather sit next to a pet on a plane than a child, although when given the choice between a 2-hour flight next to a pet on a plane or an 8-hour road trip without any animals, 45% opt for the 8-hour trip.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Travel Accommodations for Pet Owners<\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>24% of pet owners don&#8217;t travel more with their pets due to difficulty finding pet-friendly accommodation.<\/li>\n<li>72% report altering their travel plans to accommodate their pet&#8217;s needs better. 37% do it occasionally, and nearly 1 in 10 (9%) do it frequently.<\/li>\n<li>17% consider the pet-friendliness of a location to be their first priority when planning a trip. 59% prioritize it if it aligns with some of their other preferences.<\/li>\n<li>Almost two-thirds of pet owners would bring their pet every time they traveled, if possible.<\/li>\n<li>33% of pet owners would choose to vacation anywhere with their pets rather than travel to their dream destination alone.<\/li>\n<li>25% of non-pet owners would never stay at an Airbnb marketed as &#8220;pet-friendly.&#8221; Another 1 in 5 would only do it as a last resort.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>How Much Are You Willing To Pay?<\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>62% of pet owners will pay more for a pet-friendly hotel\/Airbnb so their pet can accompany them on trips.<\/li>\n<li>64% of pet owners would pay an additional <span class=\"xn-money\">$50<\/span> per night for pet-centric amenities.<\/li>\n<li><span class=\"xn-money\">$94<\/span> is the average amount non-pet owners would pay to never be in the cabin of an airplane with someone&#8217;s pet again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For the complete findings, including insights on how non-pet owners feel about airline policies and regulations and pet-friendly accommodations, please visit the <u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4010495-1&amp;h=3659606187&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fupgradedpoints.com%2Ftravel%2Fhow-far-americans-go-to-travel-with-their-pets%2F&amp;a=full+study+online\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">full study online<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<p><b>About Upgraded Points LLC<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Headquartered in <span class=\"xn-location\">Austin, Texas<\/span>, Upgraded Points is a travel company that helps to demystify the complex world of travel and credit cards.
