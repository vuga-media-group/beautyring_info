Stardom Films for the first time provides up and coming writers without the \u201cright connections\u201d to agents or money the chance of a lifetime to have their script green-lit, fully financed and produced into a $1M feature length motion picture. Stardom Films USA just announced three (3) new movies searching for screenplays in three (3) different popular genres which are listed at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.Stardom-USA.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.Stardom-USA.com<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>The odds of Stardom Films green-lighting, financing and producing the winning scripts are much much more improved than the long shot odds of winning a typical screenwriting contest where registrants have only a 1 in 1,000 chance (sometimes \u201cmany thousands\u201d depending on which competition or film festival) of receiving the coveted Best screenplay \u201cLaurel\u201d. The sad and shocking statistic is that even for the lucky winners who ever get a Best screenplay \u201cLaurel\u201d, less than 5% of those winning screenplays ever get financed and produced. In other words, some of the best screenplays and most amazing stories end up in Hollywood Forever cemetery.<\/p>\n<p>While Stardom supports the current WGA writer\u2019s strike (in fact several Stardom Team members are on the picket lines in Hollywood), the Stardom model is NOT for veteran, experienced writers who are signatory to WGA, have a top literary agent, or have multiple produced film credits. Jeff Vanderpol, President and Founder of Stardom Films adds: &#8220;Stardom Films is about empowering talented underdogs to showcase their skills and work alongside professionals in the film industry. Our unique methodology for making movies not only funds projects, but it also creates career opportunities for individuals who can\u2019t get that first lucky break. We believe that talent should be the only barrier to entry in the film industry.&#8221; In addition, Stardom doesn\u2019t care what gender people are or what their race or religion is. Unlike some other writing contests Stardom promises that no one will be discriminated against or even asked these demographic or extremely personal quota questions. Stardom judges 100% solely on Talent.<\/p>\n<p>Stardom Films is disrupting the film industry by democratizing access to opportunities and funding for any writers who believe they have talent. With multiple projects in the pipeline and a proven track record of successful partnerships and collaborations, Stardom is poised to change the face of Hollywood. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.stardom-uk.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Stardom Films UK<\/a> is partnering with Posterity Films on the movie: \u201cOne Night in Bath,\u201d scheduled to shoot in England this July and Stardom Heritage Films is partnering with Red Guerrilla Entertainment on another movie set to film in Atlanta this summer. <\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Stardom Films and its current screenwriting contests, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.Stardom-USA.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.Stardom-USA.com<\/a>.
