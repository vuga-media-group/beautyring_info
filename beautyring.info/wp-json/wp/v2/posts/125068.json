Flexible tube manufacture and distribution have been impacted by the pandemic&#8217;s effects on the global supply chain. Due to travel restrictions and lockdowns, several manufacturers of flexible tubes have experienced difficulties locating raw materials, labor, and transportation. This led to a shortage of varieties of flexible tubes, which caused the production and delivery of goods to be delayed. The pandemic-induced economic crisis reduced demand for flexible tubes in non-medical uses like the automobile and aerospace sectors. The market for flexible tubes has been further impacted by this drop in demand.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li> However, the market for flexible tubes did suffer some positive consequences from the pandemic. Thus, the demand for flexible tubes used in medical devices such as ventilators, breathing masks, and other equipment has risen. These devices, which are crucial for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, must be made with flexible tubes.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li> The flexible tube market in the post-COVID-19 period is anticipated to present both new obstacles and opportunities as governments around the world invest in new technologies. This tendency has led to an increase in demand for the growth of the flexible tube market.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>The plastics segment is expected to <\/b><b>maintain<\/b><b> its lead throughout the forecast period-\u00a0\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Based on material type, the plastics segment accounted for the largest share in 2022, contributing to more than two-thirds of the global flexible tube market revenue, and is projected to maintain its lead throughout the forecast period. Numerous plastic materials that are intended to be flexible and bendable are used to create a flexible plastic tube. Depending on the intended function, many materials can be used to create flexible plastic tubes, but silicone, PVC, and polyethylene are some of the more popular ones. These materials can be chosen to satisfy certain requirements and offer a variety of qualities, such as resistance to heat or chemicals. These tubes are frequently employed for several purposes, including the delivery of fluids in medical and dental offices and the protection of electrical wires. However, the metal segment would display the fastest CAGR of 5.6% during the forecast period. Due to the fact that metal flexible tubes can withstand high temperatures and pressures, which raises their demand in end-use industries such as automotive, aerospace, and chemical processing.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Procure Complete Report (<\/b><b>300<\/b><b> Pages PDF with Insights, Charts, Tables, and Figures) @ <\/b><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=kx0vTWRb9CGkB0jIs8nC7NT1eDoMl1lCJDa82xIPk3X5VuLyrFWL5W-29qozylVpTD-VG6y80-AFgyHmC5RoqPz6vmalcgav5852mFN9xns=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>https:\/\/bit.ly\/443lhNY<\/b><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>The others segment to rule the roost by 2032-\u00a0\u00a0<\/b>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:0px;\">Based on application, the scientific equipment segment accounted for the largest share in 2022, contributing to more than one-fifth of the global flexible tube market revenue.
