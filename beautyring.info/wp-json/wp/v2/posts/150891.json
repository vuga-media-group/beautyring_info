Inspired by and modeled after the iconic Coca-Cola retail refrigerator, the CBC Pop-In is a turnkey shelf display of 6-12 beauty brands that can be easily \u201cpopped in\u201d to an existing retail partner\u2019s environment. The CBC pays rent for the space and provides the products and shelving for easy installation.<\/p>\n<p>The \u200b\u200bConscious Beauty Collective is a group of conscious beauty &amp; wellness brands led by haircare brand MASAMI. The CBC launched in 2022 in San Francisco\u2019s Stonestown Galleria for 3 months, then moved to Natick Mall outside of Boston for the holidays in 2022. The CBC then moved to Southern California at Victoria Gardens in Rancho Cucamonga from April &#8211; June 2023 and has most recently been in downtown Palm Springs, CA from Sept 2023 &#8211; April 2024.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile we love having our own pop-up store, the idea of extending our reach even further through retail partnerships is alluring,\u201d said Lynn Power, Founder of MASAMI &amp; the Conscious Beauty Collective. \u201cWe\u2019re able to get even more momentum by aligning with boutique retailers looking for products that meet their ethos.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The CBC has secured 3 pop-ins to date. The first is with <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.remediesherbshop.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Remedies Herb Shop<\/a> in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. The store\u2019s owner, Cheryl Boiko has been in her location for a decade and has been looking to inject some fresh energy and news into the space. Cheryl says, \u201cThe Conscious Beauty Collective is the perfect solution for me. I love that all of the brands are good for you and good for the environment, so we\u2019re very much aligned on our values.\u201d Participating brands in the Remedies Herb Shop x Conscious Beauty Collective Pop-In include Cecile\u2019s Bath &amp; Body, Chuda Skincare, Glow Botanica by Hormone University, Immunocologie, HEAR ME RAW, Isle de Nature, MASAMI, Modern Age Skin, Reap &amp; Glow, Scentfluence, Skinergy and Well &amp; Wonder.<\/p>\n<p>The CBC and Remedies are hosting a launch event to meet the founders of the CBC brands on May 22 from 6-8. All are welcome to attend. Details and RSVP are here.<\/p>\n<p>The second pop-up will be at Palm Springs Vitamin Infusions, a wellness center that\u2019s been providing premium vitamin infusions and IV\u2019s for over a decade to help boost energy levels, stimulate the immune system, help with everyday stress, jet lag and sleep problems. According to General Manager, Erik Severson, \u201cThe partnership with the CBC allows us to offer even more of a spa-like experience to our customers. They are proactive about their health and look for products that are clean. It\u2019s a great fit.\u201d The pop-up will start June 1 and will support 6-8 brands including MASAMI, Sumbody, Isle de Nature, Karavie, Olecea Beaute and Veriphy Skincare.<\/p>\n<p>The third pop-in is with CBC brand, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.adoratherapy.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">ADORAtherapy<\/a>, who is expanding from their Asheville, NC store to open a second store in Miami. The ADORAtherapy store is located in the trendy Wynwood neighborhood and is scheduled to open in June 2024. The CBC will be taking over a section of the store for 3 months starting in July and will house approximately 20 CBC brands including MASAMI, Auv\u00ea Beauty, Corsica Scents, Day + West, Earth &amp; Halo, Empress Naturals, Isle de Nature, Lunaescent, OLITA, PURR skincare, Safo Hair, Scentfluence and Simply This skincare.<\/p>\n<p>Laura McCann, Adoratherapy founder says, \u201cMiami is booming right now, especially for clean beauty. We\u2019re excited to bring ADORAtherapy\u2019s chakra based intentional healing fragrances to Miami and support the Conscious Beauty Collective. Having the CBC in our shop was a no-brainer \u2013 it helps us create more excitement, more awareness and more education by having other like-minded brands join us. Lynn adds: \u201cThe future of indie beauty is collaboration: we are stronger as a collective than on our own, and small brands showcasing their products in non-traditional retail channels allows them to claim their uniqueness in a sea of retail sameness.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Conscious Beauty Collective will continue to look for new and innovative ways to showcase the CBC brands, and will be expanding the pop-in experiences all across the U.S. in 2024 and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>About Conscious Beauty Collective:<br \/>The Conscious Beauty Collective is THE indie beauty and wellness roadshow.
