Karen Keiser blends practical advice, documented research and her own personal experiences to provide no-nonsense guidance about how to succeed and achieve real change as an elected official.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe political gridlock in D.C. has created a national culture of cynicism about our government. But the untold story is that in many states, positive change is happening,\u201d Keiser said.<\/p>\n<p>Perfect for candidates and elected state legislators, city councilmembers, school board members, citizen activists, advocates, political scientists and students of government, Getting Elected is the Easy Part offers an insider\u2019s view of the ins and outs of achieving legislative landmarks. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe book is especially helpful to women and people of color who are newly elected \u2014 to state legislatures, city councils or school boards \u2014 who are new to the often male dominated, hidebound, traditional institutions of government with its arcane procedures and unwritten rules,\u201d Keiser added.<\/p>\n<p>Getting Elected is the Easy Part focuses on the culture adjustments and challenges many newly elected lawmakers face and offers tips and advice to help them achieve legislative goals, including:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tTurning campaign promises into legislation<br \/>\u2022\tSecuring bipartisan support<br \/>\u2022\tBuilding trust with other legislators <br \/>\u2022\tSex discrimination and DEI issues<br \/>\u2022\tUnderstanding legislative positions, processes and procedures <br \/>\u2022\tBalancing family needs and work demands<br \/>\u2022\tThe role of lobbyists<br \/>\u2022\tAnd much more <\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople run for election, and they&#8217;re coming to the Legislature with the wind at their back thinking, I\u2019m going to change the world,\u201d Keiser said. \u201cThey&#8217;d like to get it done overnight. But that doesn&#8217;t happen and they get discouraged. I wrote the book to encourage them to persist and achieve their goals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About Author and Sen. Karen Keiser<br \/>Sen. Karen Keiser is a veteran legislator who has successfully achieved real change, while serving in both the majority and minority and in both chambers of the Washington State Legislature. She represents Washington\u2019s 33rd Legislative District, which contains a number of suburban cities south of Seattle. As Senate President Pro Tempore, and as current chair of the Senate Labor &amp; Commerce Committee, she champions policies that help working families and improve women\u2019s economic security. <\/p>\n<p>She was a pivotal leader in reforming Washington\u2019s health care system, fully implementing the Affordable Care Act, and passing Washington\u2019s nation-leading Paid Family and Medical Leave program. She has focused on prescription drug costs, and passed a permanent cap on insulin out of-pocket costs last year. She also serves on the budget-writing Ways &amp; Means Committee and as vice chair of the Rules Committee. <\/p>\n<p>Born and raised in Merrill, Iowa, Keiser moved to Southern California for her senior year in high school. She attended the University of California, Berkeley, receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science and a master\u2019s degree in journalism. She worked as a broadcast journalist in Portland, Denver and Seattle before becoming the communications director for the Washington State Labor Council, AFL-CIO. <\/p>\n<p>She has three adult children. When she is not running for or serving in the legislature, she enjoys singing, dancing, traveling and gardening. <\/p>\n<p>Follow her on social media at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/karen.keiser\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/karen.keiser<\/a> and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KarenKeiser1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/KarenKeiser1<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Amazon link: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Getting-Elected-Easy-Part-Legislature\/dp\/1638640114\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Getting-Elected-Easy-Part-Legislature\/dp\/1638640114<\/a>  <\/p>\n<p>Getting Elected is the Easy Part: Working and Winning in the State Legislature <br \/>Publisher: Washington State University Press (Basalt Books imprint)<br \/>ISBN-10: \u200e 1638640114 <br \/>ISBN-13: \u200e 978-1638640110 <br \/>Available on Amazon.com, BN.com and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/wsupress.wsu.edu\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/wsupress.wsu.edu<\/a> <\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Trish Stevens<br \/>Ascot Media Group, Inc.<br \/>+1 832-334-2733<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/673324826\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AscotMediaGroup\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AscotMediaGroup\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/trish-stevens-99728335\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=8_BEl6jSbU9Xpwk2&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      December 06, 2023, 16:28 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/673324826\/senator-reveals-unwritten-rules-of-working-in-state-legislature\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
