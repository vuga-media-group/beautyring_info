This is her first work since she left Shanghai and returned to Canada two years ago. Through a skylark, a farewell song was sung about the prosperity and loneliness, brightness and darkness, disaster and redemption of Shanghai over the past hundred years.<\/p>\n<p>Mike Medavoy and Bei La<\/p>\n<p>This work was completed during her travels, including the Lake Mochizuki in Hokkaido, Beverly Hills, Concord in Massachusetts, Vancouver Harbour, Niagara Town, and an isolated island on Lake Ontario. This is hertribute paid as the meditation on Henry David Thoreau\u2019s Walden.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/a.co\/d\/0VYVgrh\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">The Cursed Piano<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The book records the thrilling journey of her maternal grandfather as a survivor of the shocking Jiangyashipwreck in December 1948, which had a death toll even far exceeding that of the Titanic. She describes her father, who was a military doctor, taking the risk of hiding more than ten ancestral gold bars and jewelry in the soil of his own iron tree during the Cultural Revolution, avoiding the fate of being confiscated but enduring the hardships brought by wealth. She also depicts the extraordinary significance of the Christian faith of her parents\u2019 family to their lives. And she looksback at the distorted era when she was criticized for peeking at world classics in her youth. She witnesses the human nature revealed by the COVID-19 epidemic around the world.<\/p>\n<p>What made Bei La decide to give up her luxurious life in Shanghai was not her experiences during the quarantine hotel and lockdown period, but rather, as a human being, everything she experienced during those special times has passed away with the wind. She left because she was called and pulled by a free soul. When a writer sees desolation amidst the hustle and bustle, yearning for tranquility amidst the clamor, and seeking her own \u201cWalden\u201din the endless wilderness, she is awakened by literature.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe farther away from one\u2019s hometown in terms of geographical location, the closer the hometown in literature,\u201d said Bei La.<\/p>\n<p>She wrote in this book: Humans are immersed in a large sphere, gradually shrouded in anxiety, fear, absurdity, nothingness, and despair. In the ever-changing world, the unpredictability of fate has become a human destiny. This is an era that has become indifferent to tragedy. Any pain is futile. When a person is far away from the hustle and bustle, you will hear your own voice, and your soul will return to the wilderness of freedom.<\/p>\n<p>The girl doesn\u2019t speak<\/p>\n<p>But it tells of sadness;<\/p>\n<p>The silence of the river<\/p>\n<p>Only records the years;<\/p>\n<p>Time daydreaming<\/p>\n<p>But it answered everything<\/p>\n<p>This is the skylark singing: \u201cPlease give me the freedom to fall deeply in love with someone, give me the courage to embrace you tightly. Please give me a path to explore truth, and give me the power to find light in darkness,even if it requires sacrificing my life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNo matter what she has experienced or is currently experiencing,Bei La can always extract beneficial nutrients from hardships and transform them into valuable literary wealth. The light of brightness and hope has not disappeared in her eyes for a second. She stands at the spiritual pole and her thoughts far exceed those of contemporary writers. This is the best annotation that Shanghai Bei La can become the world\u2019s Bei La,\u201d said her literary agent An Boshun.<\/p>\n<p>French Opera: The Lover of Shanghai<\/p>\n<p>The French opera Shanghai Lovers adapted from Bei La\u2019 novel was accomplished on May 24th at the Fontainebleau Theater. This opera has 13 scenes and is expected to be performed in 2 hours and 10 minutes. The lineup is very strong, reproducing the bustling modernity and true love of Shanghai a century ago. The rivers of this Far Eastern city are full of her spirit of embracing all rivers.<\/p>\n<p>This French opera that reproduces Bei La&#8217;s hometown will premiere in Paris and tour the world.<\/p>\n<p>Bei La<\/p>\n<p>Bei La is a Canadian citizen born in Shanghai. As a contemporary writer of romanticism and humanitarianism, she also serves as a Visiting Researcher for the Institute of Arts and Humanities in Shanghaijiao Tong University. She has published over a dozen novels, including \u201cThe Cursed Piano\u201d, \u201cSong of Survivors\u201d, \u201cSentimental Casablanca\u201d, etc. Over the years, Bei La has focused her literary creation and researches on \u201cJews in Shanghai\u201d. During the past two decades, she has visited Jews across the world who lived or were born in Shanghai, gathering a large number of first-hand historical materials. The \u201cJews in Shanghai\u201d series is designed to include ten books. Howard Goldblatt, a renowned Jewish American sinologist, is the English translator of her works. \u201cThe Cursed Piano\u201d, the last work of British playwright Ronald Harwood who is the Oscar Winner of Best Screenplay for \u201cThe Pianist\u201d, is based on Bei La\u2019s novel of the same name, also known as the companion piece of \u201cThe Pianist\u201d. Bei La\u2019s work \u201cSong of the Survivors\u201d is regarded as the Shanghai version of \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d. \u201cSong of Survivors\u201d is based on the experience of Mike Medavoy\u2019s parents in Shanghai during World War II. Mike grew up and became a top Hollywood producer who is an eight-time Oscar Winner of Best Picture with films such as \u201cOne Flew over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d. With love and faith as the main thread, Bei La\u2019s works portray the humanitarian spirit of her hometown Shanghai by demonstrating the shared emotions and destiny of human beings, and fleshing out the wisdom and humor of the Jews, who showed tremendous optimism and resilience in the face of misery and uprooted existence. With an eye for love and beauty, Bei La tells the stories of Jews related to Shanghai, spreading the seed of love and faith to the world. In addition to her literary creation, as a music and art lover, Bei La also performed the piano solo \u201cButterfly lovers\u201c in a concert of the Israeli pianist Yaron Kolberg, and she once gave a concert at the Shanghai Concert Hall as well.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Zeta<br \/>The Tears of the Skylark<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/730169196\" data-src=\"ZK5qAQ9tNNrKUoEK\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=XOqJfUBZpFKrllPN&amp;i=ZK5qAQ9tNNrKUoEK\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      July 26, 2024, 16:33 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/730169196\/bei-la-a-shanghai-skylark-sings-the-song-of-walden\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
