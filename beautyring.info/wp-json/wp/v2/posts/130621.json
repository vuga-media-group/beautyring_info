Historically, one out of every two wishes granted in the U.S. through Make-A-Wish has been a <span class=\"xn-location\">Disney<\/span> wish. The entire <span class=\"xn-location\">Disney<\/span> family works with Make-A-Wish to grant life-changing wishes, including theme park and resort vacations, cruises, shopping sprees, studio visits, talent meet-and-greets, sports-themed experiences and more. Granting wishes in distinctly <span class=\"xn-location\">Disney<\/span> ways is an integral part of the cast experience, as many <span class=\"xn-location\">Disney<\/span> employees are wish-granting volunteers, parents of wish kids or wish alumni themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Once Upon A Wish Party is one of the many ways <span class=\"xn-location\">Disney<\/span> brings wishes to life across Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. Following the enchanting event at Walt Disney World, <span class=\"xn-location\">Disney<\/span> wish-granting events will also take place at Aulani, A Disney Resort and Spa and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort in celebration of World of Frozen opening in December.<\/p>\n<p>Visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3954447-1&amp;h=1699361646&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwish.org%2Fdisney&amp;a=Wish.org%2FDisney\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Wish.org\/<span class=\"xn-location\">Disney<\/span><\/a> to learn more about other ways <span class=\"xn-location\">Disney<\/span> is supporting Make-A-Wish.<\/p>\n<p>SOURCE Walt Disney World Resort<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt src=\"https:\/\/rt.prnewswire.com\/rt.gif?NewsItemId=FL94791&amp;Transmission_Id=202308281730PR_NEWS_USPR_____FL94791&amp;DateId=20230828\" style=\"border:0px; width:1px; height:1px;\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Originally published at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/walt-disney-world-resort-hosts-make-a-wish-families-across-america-for-world-princess-week-party-301911677.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer sponsored\">https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/walt-disney-world-resort-hosts-make-a-wish-families-across-america-for-world-princess-week-party-301911677.html<\/a><br \/>\n<font size=\"-1\"><em>Images courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/pixabay.com<\/a><\/em><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Disney surpasses 150,000 wishes granted for children with critical illnesses in biggest wish-granting event ever held at Walt Disney World, which culminated in a royal ball with Disney princesses.
