Luke Bennecke<\/a> in which John Bastian, after waking from a coma, discovers memories from his past life as Jack Bachman and sets out on a dangerous journey to find treasure, save his former wife, and confront his murderer.<\/p>\n<p>It all starts after a freak skiing accident unlocks hidden memories. With unshakable visions of a brutal ax attack, the cursed Lafayette treasure, and a captivating redheaded woman, John searches to find answers and solve the mystery of who he is and who he was.<\/p>\n<p>On a perilous path and with a hurricane fast approaching, John fights for his survival and the safety of those he loves, threats haunting him at every turn. Will he find redemption, or be consumed by an unquenchable thirst for revenge?<\/p>\n<p>ECHO FROM A BAYOU combines elements of action, adventure and suspense with a pronounced element of \u201cthe unexplainable,\u201d riding the line between supernatural and existential. Bennecke demonstrates unparalleled skill in tying together multiple plot lines, exploring meaningful themes such as autism and LGBTQ awareness, and saving a few surprises until the very last page.<\/p>\n<p>More than just thrills and suspense, the author makes a point to raise awareness about autism and intricately weaves it into the storyline. Bennecke&#8217;s genre-bending writing techniques and masterful storytelling ensure that readers will have an extraordinary experience.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I thought it would be a worthwhile challenge to take the real-life, fascinating phenomenon of children mysteriously having inexplicable memories of past lives and wrap it with mystery, romance, suspense, and a splash of the supernatural,\u201d says Bennecke. \u201cI mean, what would YOU do if you discovered who murdered you in a past life? And I found a terrific opportunity to bring much-needed awareness to autism by adding a dash of neurodiverse behaviors to one of the characters. So far, all the reviews have come in well above my expectations!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The book contains many facets of thematic depth and writing excellence, making it exceptional in the thriller\/mystery genre. Each character is imbued with a strong, straightforward motivation, which helps to drive the plot and simultaneously create suspense.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What can I say about this fantastic novel?\u201d writes Independent Book Review. \u201cThe pacing is amazing. The action starts on the first page and only gathers momentum from there. Bennecke knows exactly where to drip-feed information and where to cut it off to keep readers hooked without being frustrated. The premise is so intricate and uniquely executed. It\u2019s the kind of story you can jump on board with immediately.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Ruthless treasure hunters, hidden secrets, callous murders, and the concept of reincarnation are just a few of the exciting elements vying for attention in this relentless novel,\u201d adds Indies Today.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJ.
