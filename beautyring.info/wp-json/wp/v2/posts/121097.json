With offices across the world, the practice works as a single entity that is both ethnically and culturally diverse. Additional consultants will provide expertise on spa, art, technology, and food &amp; beverage.<\/p>\n<p>Erth&#8217;s relationship with Accor started a few years ago with a prestigious development in the region &#8211; Raffles Hotel and Residences Jeddah &#8211; which consists of two towers. In one tower, a world-class luxury hotel; in the other, a stunning set of exclusive private residences, unlike anything <span class=\"xn-location\">Jeddah<\/span> has known before, set against a rich backdrop of Hejazi culture and tradition.<\/p>\n<p>Since the announcement of Saudi Arabia Vision 2030, Erth and Accor have both played a key role in the development of tourism through several existing and upcoming projects in key locations across the Kingdom. Accor has been present in <span class=\"xn-location\">Saudi Arabia<\/span> for more than 20 years and has contributed to the development of the Holy destination of <span class=\"xn-location\">Makkah<\/span>, counting over 9,000 rooms with direct access to the Haram.<\/p>\n<p>Within the <span class=\"xn-location\">Kingdom of Saudi Arabia<\/span>, Accor currently operates 42 properties (16,000+ rooms) and has a robust development pipeline of 34 properties which will add approximately 7,000 rooms to the Group&#8217;s portfolio by 2027. Properties expected to arrive in the Kingdom in 2023 include the much-anticipated Raffles Jeddah, Fairmont Ramla Serviced Residences Riyadh, Sofitel Riyadh, Movenpick Waad Al Shamal-Turaif and Novotel Makkah Thakher City Residences. Among its <span class=\"xn-location\">Saudi Arabia<\/span> portfolio, Accor is leading the way with positive hospitality experiences and environmentally sound development and operational practices.
