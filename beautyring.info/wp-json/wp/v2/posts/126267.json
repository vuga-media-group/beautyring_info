Olympic Blvd. in downtown Los Angeles.  The festival runs from July 19-30, 2023, and ranks among the most prestigious and largest international short film festivals in the world. It\u2019s the longest-running short film festival in LA, attracting 10,000 attendees each year. This year, the festival will showcase 529 films from 34 countries around the world. <\/p>\n<p>Directed by award-winning filmmaker Nikki Hevesy, A YEAR TO LIFE made its international world premiere at the Bardolino film Festival in Italy. The film features an ensemble cast, starring Lazarus Guidry (DEADFALL, STRAIGHT OUTTA OF COMPTON) and introducing fresh faces Noble B. Whitted, Tony Jordan and Nicholas Peters. A YEAR TO LIFE was written and produced by Hevesy and Jahmal Holland. Yabetz Cohen-Perez and Guidry served as co-executive producers  and Anise Fuller served as associate producer, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>A YEAR TO LIFE was filmed in the Watts neighborhood and surrounding areas of South Los Angeles. Like \u201cSnowfall\u201d and \u201cBoyz \u2018n the Hood,\u201d the film portrays a realistic look at life in the inner-city, but without duplicating the same themes. It has a different twist. For many years, Hevesy attended weekly meetings in South Los Angeles as a supporter and advocate of Southern California Ceasefire, a grassroots organization that has become an integral part of the community in its mission to reduce violence. \u201cI have become acquainted and gained respect for  the amazing people on the front lines \u2013 many with criminal backgrounds, who have turned their lives around &#8212; and dedicated themselves to saving lives and rescuing at-risk kids in the inner city.,\u201d said Hevesy. Through prevention and intervention, these foot soldiers work to stop the shootings,  keep kids out of the criminal justice system and break the school to prison pipeline. <\/p>\n<p>Inspired by a true story, A YEAR TO LIFE  embodies the spirit of those street soldiers who sacrifice themselves to give back to their communities and make a difference in the lives of young people. Hevesy wants to raise awareness about the juvenile incarceration rates, and how the schoolhouse to jailhouse pipeline disproportionately affects teens and young adults from disadvantaged backgrounds.  She hopes the short  film will shine a spotlight on the hard work that is being done in BIPOC communities to make a lasting impact on the next generation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am very humbled that A YEAR TO LIFE is an official selection of the Los Angeles Shorts International Film Festival, \u201c said Hevesy. \u201cThis is about the concept of Tikkun Olam (repairing the world). I wanted to make an authentic film that  highlights an ordinary person doing extraordinary acts to make a difference in a young person\u2019s life. It will challenge the viewer  to ask himself\/herself: \u2018How far would you go to save a life?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>SCREENING DATES AT THE LA SHORTS INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tFriday, July 28, 2023 | 5:30 p.m. PT<\/p>\n<p>All screenings take place at  the Regal Cinemas, located at LA Live in downtown Los Angeles, 1000 W.
