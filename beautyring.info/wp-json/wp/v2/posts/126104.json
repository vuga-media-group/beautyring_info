(NYSE: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ticket-symbol\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#financial-modal\">AHT<\/a>) (&#8220;Ashford Trust&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) today provided an update on the extensions for its KEYS loan pools, which had an initial maturity date in <span class=\"xn-chron\">June 2023<\/span>. Each of the KEYS loan pools had an extension test that required the hotels secured by each loan to achieve a certain debt yield in order to qualify for the one-year extension. None of the KEYS loan pools achieved the required debt yield tests, but the Company had the right to pay down the loans by the amount needed to comply with the required tests. The Company has extended its KEYS Pool\u00a0C loan \u2013 secured by five hotels with a paydown of approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$62 million<\/span>, its KEYS Pool D loan \u2013 secured by five hotels with a paydown of approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$26 million<\/span>, and its KEYS Pool E loan \u2013 secured by five hotels with a paydown of approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$41 million<\/span>.\u00a0 In the interest of protecting stockholder value and liquidity, the Company has elected not to make the required paydowns to extend its KEYS Pool A loan \u2013 secured by seven hotels, its KEYS Pool B loan \u2013 secured by seven hotels, and its KEYS Pool F loan \u2013 secured by five hotels (collectively, the hotels secured by such KEYS loan pools, the &#8220;Non-Extended KEYS Hotels&#8221;). The Company has been in discussions with the lenders on these loan pools seeking modifications to the extension tests, but at this time, it appears that the most likely outcome will be a consensual transfer of these hotels to the respective lenders.<\/p>\n<p>The Company believes it&#8217;s in the best interest of its common and preferred stockholders to not make the required paydown of approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$255 million<\/span> for the Non-Extended KEYS Hotels. Based on its estimates of hotel values and supported by recent comparable transactions and brokers opinion of value, the Company believes that there is negative equity value in the Non-Extended KEYS Hotels as evidenced by the combined trailing 12-month Net Operating Income debt yield of 5.6% through the first quarter of 2023. The current interest rate for the KEYS A, B and\u00a0F loans is approximately 8.8%. Based on the current level of operating performance and the current\u00a0SOFR rate, the Non-Extended KEYS Hotels were not covering debt service. The Company marketed two of these pools for sale and did not receive any bids above the existing loan balances. By not extending these loan pools, the Company will save <span class=\"xn-money\">$255 million<\/span> in required\u00a0paydowns as well as approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$80 million<\/span> in capital expenditures at these hotels through 2025. The Non-Extended KEYS Hotels are expected to require capital expenditures that average over 18% of annual revenues through 2025 compared to the industry standard capital expenditure reserve of 4%-5% of annual revenues. For the most part, the Non-Extended KEYS Hotels are located in markets that have experienced significant\u00a0headwinds throughout their post-pandemic recoveries, and a number of these markets are not forecasted to reach pre-pandemic topline levels until 2025 or 2026. Through the first quarter of 2023, trailing 12-month total revenue for the Non-Extended KEYS Hotels was down 13% compared to total revenue for 2019, while total revenue for the rest of the\u00a0Ashford Trust portfolio was only down 1% compared to 2019. Also, the Non-Extended KEYS Hotels have experienced higher growth in expenses compared to the balance of the\u00a0Ashford Trust portfolio. Through the first quarter of 2023, trailing 12-month total labor cost per occupied room for the Non-Extended KEYS Hotels was up 27% compared to 2019, while total labor cost per occupied room for the rest of the\u00a0Ashford Trust portfolio was up 12% compared to 2019. The Non-Extended KEYS Hotels only generated approximately 10% of the Company&#8217;s trailing 12-month Hotel EBITDA and the Company&#8217;s\u00a0RevPAR will increase approximately 3% by removing these lower RevPAR hotels from the portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>The removal of these assets and the corresponding debt from the Company&#8217;s financial statements will decrease the Company&#8217;s net debt to gross assets by over three percentage points. After the removal of the Non-Extended KEYS Hotels from the Company&#8217;s portfolio and taking into account hotels that the Company expects will exit their respective cash traps after second quarter operating results are finalized, only four of the Company&#8217;s hotels will remain in cash traps.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a prudent economic decision that reflects a comprehensive capital management process by the Company, which explored and assessed multiple options for these assets including refinancing, extensions, and potential asset sales,&#8221; commented <span class=\"xn-person\">Rob Hays<\/span>, Ashford Trust&#8217;s President and Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;The recent amendment to our corporate financing provides us with added flexibility regarding these loan pools.\u00a0 Proactively choosing not to extend three of these loan pools improves our balance sheet by lowering leverage and materially improves our future cash flows. The combination of the paydowns and the removal of the debt associated with the pools we are not extending will lower our debt by approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">$700 million<\/span>, or more than 18%. With the KEYS loan pool extensions behind us, our next final maturity is our Morgan Stanley loan pool secured by 17 hotels, which matures in November, and we currently believe that loan should be able to be extended with no\u00a0paydown required. While the hotel debt markets continue to be challenging, we believe we are well-positioned for our upcoming\u00a0maturities, and our portfolio continues to generate strong operating performance. From a capital structure and balance sheet perspective, we will continue to focus on paying off our corporate financing and raising capital through our non-traded preferred stock.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>* \u00a0* \u00a0* \u00a0* \u00a0*<\/p>\n<p>Ashford Hospitality Trust is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on investing predominantly in upper upscale, full-service hotels.<\/p>\n<p><b><u>KEYS A Loan Pool Hotels:<br class=\"dnr\"><\/u><\/b>Courtyard <span class=\"xn-person\">Columbus Tipton Lakes<\/span> \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Columbus, IN<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">Courtyard Old Town \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Scottsdale, AZ<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">Residence Inn Hughes Center \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Las Vegas, NV<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">Residence Inn Phoenix Airport \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Phoenix, AZ<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">Residence Inn San Jose Newark \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Newark, CA<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">SpringHill Suites Manhattan Beach \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Hawthorne, CA<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">SpringHill Suites Plymouth Meeting \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Plymouth Meeting, PA<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><u>KEYS B Loan Pool Hotels:<br class=\"dnr\"><\/u><\/b>Courtyard <span class=\"xn-location\">Basking Ridge<\/span> \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Basking Ridge, NJ<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">Courtyard Newark Silicon Valley \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Newark, CA<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">Courtyard Oakland Airport \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Oakland, CA<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">Courtyard Plano Legacy Park \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Plano, TX<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">Residence Inn Plano \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Plano, TX<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">SpringHill Suites BWI Airport \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Baltimore, MD<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">TownePlace Suites Manhattan Beach \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Hawthorne, CA<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><u><span>KEYS C Loan Pool Hotels: <br class=\"dnr\"><\/span><\/u><\/b><span>Hyatt Coral Gables \u2013 <span class=\"xn-location\">Coral Gables, FL<\/span> <br class=\"dnr\"><\/span><span>Hilton Ft.
