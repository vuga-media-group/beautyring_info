In addition, organic and natural is a market that is currently popular and is present in practically all color cosmetic products. The market is witnessing an increase in demand for natural products as customers become more health conscious and aware of the unhygienic manufacture and cultivation of ingredients and their effects on the skin.<\/p>\n<p>Rise in skin-related problems by chemical cosmetics has discouraged customers from using chemical color cosmetics, and many have started to choose natural color cosmetics instead. Natural ingredients including jojoba oil, coconut oil, botanical cactus, and aloe vera extract are used to make natural brow gels. A natural brow gel has no dangerous ingredients and is safe to use. An important element driving growth of the global brow gel market is rise in demand for natural brow gels on a global scale. People take great care while selecting brow gels with natural components as eyes and area around the eyes are important part of the face.<\/p>\n<p>According to the brow gel market analysis, the brow gel market is segmented into price point, distribution channel and region. According to the brow gel market trends, on the basis of price point, the premium segment was the significant revenue contributor to the market, with $75.6 million in 2021, and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 5.7% during the forecast period. Moreover, awareness of luxury skin care and color cosmetics has increased, owing to rise in per capita income and purchasing power, thus brow gel and other high-end color cosmetic products are selling quickly. The advent of more natural goods, especially those made with rare raw components and offering exponential benefits, is also attributed for increase in demand for high-end color cosmetics items worldwide.<\/p>\n<p>\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc33\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2d: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/checkout-final\/94309d8b6cb6fb940a7ac9d154ed914e\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/checkout-final\/94309d8b6cb6fb940a7ac9d154ed914e<\/a><\/p>\n<p>By price point, it is segregated into economy and premium.
