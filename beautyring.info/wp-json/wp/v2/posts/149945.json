Barbara Gitenstein<\/a> chronicles the personal and historical obstacles she faced on her way to becoming the first woman and first Jewish president of The College of New Jersey. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy story captures the shock and the humor as I, almost always, was the only \u2018whatever\u2019 in the room \u2014 woman, Jew, liberal,\u201d Gitenstein said. <\/p>\n<p>In Experience Is the Angled Road, Gitenstein acknowledges the impact that people, places and perceptions had on her personal and professional identities. Calling her childhood \u201cchallenging and strange,\u201d she describes how, as a young girl, she learned that being different was all that there was. Born and raised in Florala, Alabama, after her parents headed south from New York City, Gitenstein\u2019s \u201cotherness\u201d went beyond being Jewish and a Yankee. Her intellectual passions and love of music were considered peculiar by most of her acquaintances. Plus, she grew up with a particularly embarrassing chronic disease. All of these things, she said, taught her to approach the periphery as a position of power.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI found that embracing the privilege of being an outsider results in great vision and ultimately can be a great foundation for strength,\u201d she said.  <\/p>\n<p>That combination of second sight and resilience helped guide her as she confronted sexism, anti-Semitism, regional animus, and the distrust of expertise in her professional and personal life. She also credits extraordinary mentors for helping her navigate the challenges of being the singular voice in a room. <\/p>\n<p>Gitenstein reveals her difficulties and disappointments with refreshing candor, vulnerability and doses of dry wit, resulting in a story that is uplifting, tender and an exemplar of intersectionality, leadership and survival.<\/p>\n<p>Thomas Kean, former governor of New Jersey, calls Gitenstein\u2019s memoir, \u201ca remarkably readable book about the people surrounding a young Jewish girl growing up in the Deep South. \u2026 This is an unflinchingly courageous story of love, exasperation, argument, and forgiveness.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<br \/>R.
