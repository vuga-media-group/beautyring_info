He calls that pinch \u2013 from injection of anti-inflammatory medication into the spinal region \u2013 \u201can effective and safe supplement to boost the effectiveness of conservative care and the ability to heal the patient without surgery.\u201d Studies indicate as many as 80 percent or more of patients can experience some relief from an <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.atlanticspinecenter.com\/treatments\/epidural-steroid-injections\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">epidural steroid injection<\/a> (ESI), depending on the cause of their pain. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat is important: ESIs can offer patients a long enough relief period for them to participate in physical therapy and rehabilitation activities that may resolve the underlying cause of their back pain. Injections also may enable the patient to postpone \u2013 or, in some cases, avoid \u2013 surgery,\u201d says Dr. Chang.<\/p>\n<p>ESIs are generally intended to relieve radicular pain \u2013 pain radiating to the legs from spinal nerves in the back \u2013 due to irritated or inflamed nerve roots. Common causes of this inflammation are herniation of one or more intervertebral discs in the lower (lumbar) back and stenosis, which is a narrowing of the spinal canal where the nerves exit because of slipped or collapsed discs, degenerating spinal bone, or osteoarthritis. Both are conditions that compress nerves, Dr. Chang states.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnti-inflammatory corticosteroids, sometimes mixed with a local anesthetic, can be delivered to the epidural space of the spine if a patient fails to respond to more conservative treatment measures. An ESI is a minimally invasive procedure, requiring only minutes to perform,\u201d Dr. Chang says. \u201cUsing fluoroscopy with contrast dye to guide needle placement and depth, the physician employs one of several techniques to insert the needle and deliver the medication to the proper location in the epidural space.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The epidural space surrounds the protective covering of the spine and contains blood vessels, connective tissue, and nerves. When injected into this space, corticosteroids block pain signals coming from irritated nerves, minimize the body\u2019s production of natural inflammatory substances, and suppress the chemicals that are released by damaged discs and activate nerve fibers, Dr. Chang explains. For those patients unable to tolerate corticosteroids, scientists, writing in a 2019 issue of The Cureus Journal of Medical Science, suggest substituting \u201cplant-based or homeopathic injectable therapies, [like] Traumeel<sup>\u00ae<\/sup>,\u201d as potentially \u201cviable alternatives.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Some experts contend ESIs are more effective than conservative approaches &#8212; like taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory non-steroidal medications &#8212; for controlling pain in the lower back and base of the spine (sacral area). In a 2020 article published in the journal Medicine (Baltimore), scientists write \u201cuse of ESI is more effective in alleviating lumbosacral radicular pain than conservative treatments in [the] short-term and intermediate-term. Patients [analyzed in the study] also reported more successful outcomes after receiving ESI when compared to conservative treatment.\u201d However, they add \u201cthis [beneficial] effect was not maintained at long-term follow-up.\u201d <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/rb.gy\/blpke\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/rb.gy\/blpke<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Although risks are generally low, \u201cthe safety and effectiveness of ESIs are maximized when the injections are given by physicians trained in pain management and experienced in the selection of patients best suited for such a procedure,\u201d says Dr. Chang. According to authors of an opinion article in the New England Journal of Medicine, \u201cPatient selection may be the key to optimizing the efficacy of epidural glucocorticoid injection [for relieving neck and back pain], and we encourage the medical community to work to identify the types of patients who might benefit most.\u201d <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/rb.gy\/qty07\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/rb.gy\/qty07<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Patients with infections, malignancies, or bleeding disorders are not considered candidates for ESI. Additionally, \u201ca physician may or may not proceed with an ESI if a patient has heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, or osteoporosis,\u201d Dr. Chang says. <\/p>\n<p>Scientists who wrote the 2022 National Library of Medicine article Epidural Steroid Injections call lower back pain and neck pain \u201cthe most common cause for years lived with disability in the world.\u201d But they add that ESIs \u201callow restoration of function and [a] return to a physical therapy regimen, when indicated.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Dr. Chang concurs but says people should not rely on ESIs in their later years to correct a lifetime of bad habits negatively affecting the spine. \u201cPrevention is the best treatment,\u201d he emphasizes and offers the following tips to help counteract some of the degenerative spinal effects of aging and lifestyle:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tMaintain a body weight appropriate to one\u2019s height. Extra pounds pull on and stress the spine.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tIf you smoke, stop.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tAvoid over-consumption of inflammation-promoting foods, including refined sugar, red meat, and processed foods. Consider following a nutritiously healthy and satisfying Mediterranean-style diet.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tUse proper lifting techniques, especially when picking up heavy or clumsy objects.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tJust as your mother used to tell you, practice good posture. Sit or stand straight; do not slouch in front of a computer screen for hours.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tWear shoes that support the spine and keep the body in alignment.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tExercise, exercise, exercise. Especially focus on strengthening core body muscles, because it is from the core that the spine derives most of its support. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd should your aching back require a shot of medication, follow your physician\u2019s advice. Live life with caution. Continue to be good to your spine. You are not 20 years old anymore,\u201d Dr. Chang says.<\/p>\n<p>The Atlantic Spine Center is a nationally recognized leader for endoscopic spine surgery and pain management with several locations in NJ and NYC. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.atlanticspinecenter.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.atlanticspinecenter.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Kaliq Chang, MD, is an interventional pain management specialist board-certified in anesthesiology at Atlantic Spine Center. <\/p>\n<p>Contact:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mcprpublicrelations.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.mcprpublicrelations.com<\/a> <\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Melissa Chefec<br \/>MCPR, LLC<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/634459921\/tel:+ +1 203-968-6625\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">+ +1 203-968-6625<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/634459921\/mailto:melissa@mcprpublicrelations.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">melissa@mcprpublicrelations.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=Rwa_QILO7zNJ-Pht&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      <span>MCPR, LLC<\/span>\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      May 19, 2023, 13:30 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/634459921\/when-it-comes-to-back-pain-a-little-pinch-of-anti-inflammatory-medication-may-do\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
