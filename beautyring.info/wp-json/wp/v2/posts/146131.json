Astaxanthin is synthesized in response to several stressors, such as nutritional deficiency, elevated salinity, or excessive solar exposure in algae. Astaxanthin is a red pigment classified as a xanthophyll carotenoid. It exhibits a strong antioxidant effect. It also finds commercial applications in several areas like aquaculture, food, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, and medicines.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" height=\"406\" name=\"GNW_RichHtml_External_IMG\" src=\"https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/uploads\/reports\/1708438537-astaxanthin-market.svg\" width=\"800\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong>Download Free Sample Report PDF @\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=sW3d7xbaAfzgIh09E4v2a2W6wNwHqJ0wNPPczmMfElQz_TZ1ZIr7CkF_2CjS45Muz1JM6ZyJ9MU9EWWl-gvVdKZX4fjCmMIKbTYYn5VL0YE1N4DB8aIKKs58wZ52UpajvEXiwFNPfgjppdYNdcfXzTMZcQTJdrSAEjgqShlaK3YAp8Q9LkyEljHX3j9Ynf5S0rGXpbCEqTRekoY4kFrNsA==\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/astaxanthin-market\/request-sample<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><b>Market Dynamics<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Rising Demand for Nutraceuticals and Natural Antioxidants Drive the Global Market<\/b><\/p>\n<p>According to Straits Research, <strong><em>\u201cThe global astaxanthin market was worth USD 1,865.87 million in 2022. It is estimated to reach USD 7,536.19 million by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 16.78% during the forecast period (2023\u20132031).\u201d<\/em><\/strong> The demand for nutraceuticals and natural antioxidants is expected to increase due to the rising awareness of nutrition for maintaining a healthy lifestyle and the growing preference for dietary supplements as a result of the expensive nature of hospitalization. Market players are substantially expanding their production capacity to contend with the rising demand for nutraceutical items. Algatech Ltd. expanded its production capacity for FucoVital, a dietary supplement derived from brown algae, by a factor of three in order to meet the growing demand in the market.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, major players in the nutraceutical industry&#8217;s need for astaxanthin are investing in increasing their production capacity, including Beijing Gingko Group, Jianhe Biotech Co., Ltd., and Algal\u00edf Iceland ehf. Nutraceuticals are nutritional supplements that are necessary for the treatment of cardiovascular illnesses, diabetes, and cancer. They have less side effects than other options. The nutraceutical industry is expanding due to rising interest in nutrient-dense foods and supplements. Thus, there is a rise in the demand for dietary supplements containing astaxanthin.<\/p>\n<p><b>Increasing Adoption of Natural Cosmetics, Nutraceuticals, and Pharmaceuticals Creates Tremendous Opportunities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Concerns about chemical toxicity and the widespread use of synthetic additives in food and personal care products are two factors fueling the growth of natural alternatives. The usage of nutraceuticals can be advantageous for dermatologists. Nutritional Research reports that a study conducted in the United Kingdom found that astaxanthin can reduce oxidative stress, accelerating the aging process and preventing skin sagging.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, in April 2019, scientists from Japan and China investigated the effects of astaxanthin on aging in mice and found that it increased dysregulation of gene expression related to aging. Companies are using strategies including product launches and partnership formation with influential figures in end-use industries to increase the penetration of natural astaxanthin-based goods. For instance, Algatech LTD collaborated with a US-based personal care product manufacturer in March 2019 to develop topical applications for astaxanthin.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Report Scope<\/strong><\/p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width:825px; border-collapse:collapse ;\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Study Period<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">2019-2031<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">CAGR<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">16.78%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Historical Period<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">2019-2021<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Forecast Period<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">2023-2031<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Base Year<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">2022<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Base Year Market Size<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">USD 1,865.87 Million<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Forecast Year<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">2031<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Forecast Year Market Size<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">USD 7536.19 Million<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Largest Market<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">North America<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Fastest Growing Market<\/td>\n<td style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ; vertical-align: top ; \">Europe<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<p><b>Regional Analysis<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=7lxVyo5y0f6KKGW0vSoFgYvL6KiUh-LYEEvYdUtiiiHIhaRCz4Luqwp9rGj4gIoQzYUlv3uMlCZxRU6wMouslk0fMZWdxRY7QQftkiVGVkF1uWh1kSY62xaLYY65XobizlV2IUAyX-DvSLa5W3yaurk6XXuIFiLrOY4qyLhgGvM=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">North America astaxanthin market share<\/a>\u00a0is expected to expand substantially during the forecast period.
