She explores how her own tight-knit community has been impacted by its racial divide deepened in part by the 1946 Moores Ford Lynching, also known as the \u201clast mass lynching in America.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Featuring interviews with fellow residents and extensive research, \u201cUNSPOKEN\u201d offers a nuanced and complex understanding of the historical factors that contextualize racial divides across the country, as well as contemporary challenges, such as the wanton denial of histories, that continue to make substantive reconciliation difficult to achieve. Through her research and the town&#8217;s collective memory, Calabrese explores how Monroe&#8217;s community has been shaped by its racial divide for generations. This thoughtful examination of the ways that history continues to reverberate throughout society, including pervasive contemporary segregation, shatters a code of silence that has distanced neighbor from neighbor for generations.<\/p>\n<p>Academics from several universities have hosted screenings of \u201cUNSPOKEN\u201d and praised Calabrese\u2019s work.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;UNSPOKEN points to the importance of truth-telling as a way towards healing and racial reconciliation,\u201d said Dr. Molly McGehee, Emory University\u2019s Oxford College Associate Dean for Faculty Development.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;UNSPOKEN shines a light on the Moore&#8217;s Ford Lynching, a horrific act of racist violence that has been intentionally hidden from public attention for decades,\u201d said R. Alfred Vick, University of Georgia\u2019s Director of the Environmental Ethics Certificate Program. \u201cThe film presents voices of the community where this happened, revealing the lasting impact of this trauma and also the hope that honest and inclusive dialogue can break through long standing divisions and lead to healing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUNSPOKEN\u201d has received critical acclaim and recognition, winning the Audience Choice Award for Documentary at the Macon Film Festival; Documentary Features Special Jury Award at the the Rome International Film Festival; and Best Documentary Award at the Reedy Reels Film Festival. The film was also an Official Selection for the Morehouse College Human Rights Film Festival, Chagrin Documentary Film Festival, Portland Film Festival and Cinema on the Bayou Film Festival.<\/p>\n<p>To watch the trailer and learn more about the film, host a screening, or acquire a site license, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/videoproject.org\/unspoken-2023.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">videoproject.org\/unspoken-2023.html<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Philip Hudson<br \/>Rhythm Communications<br \/>+1 (404) 889-8966 x104<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/679910054\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/688666039?app_id=122963\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" title=\"UNSPOKEN Trailer 2022\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=i288jVdpCJABEqX_&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      January 08, 2024, 22:43 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/679910054\/unspoken-available-for-educational-use-ahead-of-mlk-day-black-history-month\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
