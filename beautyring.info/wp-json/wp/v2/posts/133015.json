This event will be a unique opportunity for attendees to learn about how non-promotable tasks impact women\u2019s health, finances, and promotability. <\/p>\n<p>Dr. Linda Babcock, author of &#8220;The No Club: Putting A Stop to Women&#8217;s Dead-End Work&#8221; will virtually keynote the event, to be held at the Sleepy Hollow Clubhouse in Brecksville. Dr. Babcock is a world-renowned expert on gender and negotiation, and her work has been featured in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and Forbes. She is also the James M. Walton Professor in Economics at Carnegie Mellon University and the Founder and Director of the Program for Research and Outreach on Gender Equity in Society (PROGRESS), which pursues positive social change for women and girls through education, partnerships, and research.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the keynote address, there will be a panel comprised of successful female leaders in a variety of industries: Amy Schultz, Co-Founder of Bolder Money, and Habeebah Rasheed Grimes, Founder of Positive Education Project, and Lorraine Schuchart, Founder of Prosper for Purpose. This panel will provide attendees with the opportunity to learn about the challenges and successes of other women in leadership positions and to network with like-minded individuals. Me-Her-Us will announce additional panelists via social media. <\/p>\n<p>Founded by Sandra Wint in 2021, Me-Her-Us helps women (re)connect to themselves, their work, and each other. Disconnection often looks like poor body image, people pleasing, burnout, career unfulfillment, and mean girl culture. Through One-on-One Coaching, Sistership Circles, and specialty group programs, Me-Her-Us helps women shed cultural lies and uncover their personal truth. They (re)establish who they are and who they\u2019re meant to be through conversation and community.<\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in attending this event, tickets can be purchased at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/events.me-her-us.com\/takenotesevent\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/events.me-her-us.com\/takenotesevent<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Sandra Wint<br \/>Me-Her-Us<br \/>+1 (216) 225-5508<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/658690090\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/meherusllc\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/me-her-us\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/meherusllc\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=f90JcHqX35SgWh-W&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      September 29, 2023, 20:56 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/658690090\/me-her-us-announces-october-women-s-leadership-event\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
