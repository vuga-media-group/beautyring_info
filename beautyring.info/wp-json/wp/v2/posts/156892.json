He also shares valuable lessons learned from business failures and successes. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nWhen readers consider how high Tinsley climbed in his career \u2013 to president and CEO of a family business that he grew into the ownership and operation of over 60 restaurants \u2013 compared to where he started, his message of turning obstacles into opportunities resonates. <\/p>\n<p>He faced challenges early in life that would have derailed the growth and development of most people. He was 7 months old when his mother left him in the care of an elderly woman and never returned. Raised in poverty in the racially divided South, he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by a teacher to quit school in the sixth grade.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFrom an early age, I had to learn how to face challenges head-on and turn them into opportunities,\u201d Tinsley writes. <\/p>\n<p>Tinsley went on to become a two-time college basketball All-American and academic standout at Kentucky Wesleyan College, where he helped lead the school to three NCAA Division II national championships. He also played professionally in the American Basketball Association before becoming a multiple national brand award-winning franchise owner.<\/p>\n<p>Along with showing how he kept moving forward in business, Tinsley reflects on the search for his birth parents after getting married to his college sweetheart and on key relationships that were instrumental in his life and success, beginning with his adoptive mother, Willie Tinsley, wife Seretha, and sister Mary. He also writes about the loss of his beloved daughter, Penni, and her remarkable life.<\/p>\n<p>Tinsley\u2019s book is filled with life lessons that anyone would be well-served to follow. He\u2019s a man who never forgot where he came from and never stopped believing he\u2019d get to where he wanted to go with God\u2019s blessing and a white-hot desire for success.<\/p>\n<p>About George Tinsley Sr.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nGeorge Tinsley Sr. (tinsleyspeaks.com), author of Catch as Catch Can: Building a Legacy By Finding Opportunity in Every Obstacle, is a motivational speaker, motivational coach, author, and business advisor.
