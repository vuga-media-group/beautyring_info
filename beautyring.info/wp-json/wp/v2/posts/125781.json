Beginning at approximately <span class=\"xn-chron\">10:30 a.m.<\/span> a squadron of F-35 stealth fighter jets flown by the 33<sup>rd<\/sup>\u202fFighter Wing will make two passes over the world-famous theme park. The first flyover will also include a\u202fKC-135 tanker flown\u202fby the 6th Air Refueling Wing. <span class=\"xn-money\">2023 marks<\/span> the Air Force&#8217;s 100 years of aerial refueling capabilities.

Star-spangled spectaculars are a time-honored tradition across the resort, reflecting <span class=\"xn-person\">Walt Disney&#8217;s<\/span> deep love of America and faith in the nation&#8217;s future.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The flyover is also the latest example of Disney&#8217;s long history of support for the military dating back to Disney&#8217;s founders, <span class=\"xn-person\">Walt and Roy Disney<\/span>, who both served their country during the First World War.\u00a0That tradition continues today with events like the daily Flag Retreat ceremony at Magic Kingdom Park, where an active-duty military member or veteran is selected from the park&#8217;s daily visitors to be honored. The Walt Disney Company has also been a leading proponent of hiring, training and supporting military veterans with the <b>Heroes Work Here<\/b> initiative, the <b>Heroes Supply Here<\/b> program and Disney&#8217;s <b>Veterans Institute<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>SOURCE <span class=\"xn-person\">Walt Disney World<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Originally published at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/united-states-air-force-flyover-to-thrill-guests-on-fourth-of-july-at-walt-disney-world-resort-301867711.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer sponsored\">https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/united-states-air-force-flyover-to-thrill-guests-on-fourth-of-july-at-walt-disney-world-resort-301867711.html<\/a><br \/>\n<font size=\"-1\"><em>Images courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/pixabay.com<\/a><\/em><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla., June 30, 2023 \/PRNewswire\/ &#8212; In celebration of Independence Day, Walt Disney World Resort plans to host breathtaking U.S. Air Force flyovers over Magic Kingdom Park on July 4, 2023.\u00a0 Continue Reading Cinderella Castle at Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
