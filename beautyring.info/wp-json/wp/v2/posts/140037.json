Each story activity begins with a prediction activity. The child is instructed to guess what the story will be about. They are asked to write their prediction down based on the title of the story.

This simple, yet effective activity directs the child in becoming more focused and engaged while reading the story.

Audiobooks are another great introduction to the reading development process.  The parent may choose to write down what the child tells them as their answer to each story prediction exercise. It is never too early for a child to learn how to read. This process gives the child a reason to listen or read as they confirm or reject their predictions. <\/p>\n<p>Reading skills are easily reached with vocabulary, comprehension, main idea, explicit, and implicit exercises. An easy-to-follow instruction is given at the beginning of each section. The extension exercise is a fun way for your child to apply what they already know to their way of doing things. It then becomes their unique interpretation of knowledge. This exercise helps the learner to build confidence in their ability to achieve and reduces their fear of failing.
