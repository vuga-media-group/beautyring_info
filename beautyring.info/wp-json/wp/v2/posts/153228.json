That difficulty has elements of personality, culture, and history that can easily derail the entire transition if they aren\u2019t handled well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if the founder is going to continue to be involved, the resulting dynamic can be even more challenging.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Second CEO, published by <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/advantagebooks.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Advantage Books<\/a>, guides readers through chapters such as \u201cWorking with the founder,\u201d \u201cCultural cornerstones: Purpose, vision, values,\u201d \u201cStrategy: Where to play and how to win,\u201d \u201cBuilding your team,\u201d and \u201cBuilding your two boards.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sharrers provides authentic reflection on his own journey following a founder along with his 25 years of experience in boardrooms and private equity diligence meetings. He\u2019s seen succession decisions that turned out great and others that failed. In The Second CEO, Sharrers shares those decades of stories and, as one who has mentored and coached dozens of CEOs, provides insights and a plan for success that can help new CEOs navigate the founder\u2019s legacy and align the organization with new goals and strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Sharrers says a company\u2019s growth and success hinge on getting the transition from founder to new CEO right. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cJobs, work relationships, the stress on the families of those involved, financials, business success \u2026 they\u2019re all more fragile than you might think,\u201d Sharrers writes, \u201cand succession makes them all extremely vulnerable. It\u2019s not hyperbole to say that getting this one transition wrong could destroy everything everyone has worked so hard to build.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About Matt Sharrers <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMatt Sharrers, author of The Second CEO: Accelerating Scale When Following the Founder, is the managing partner of ETJ Advisory, a firm he and his wife, Lynne, started in 2020.
