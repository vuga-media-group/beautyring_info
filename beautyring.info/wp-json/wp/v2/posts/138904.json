Wyndham shareholders are urged not to take any action with respect to the offer until the Board announces its recommendation.<\/p>\n<p>Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and PJT Partners are serving as financial advisors and Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP is legal advisor to Wyndham.<\/p>\n<p><b>About Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts (NYSE: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ticket-symbol\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#financial-modal\">WH<\/a>) is the world&#8217;s largest hotel franchising company by the number of properties, with approximately 9,100 hotels across over 95 countries on six continents.\u00a0 Through its network of approximately 858,000 rooms appealing to the everyday traveler, Wyndham commands a leading presence in the economy and midscale segments of the lodging industry.\u00a0 The Company operates a portfolio of 24 hotel brands, including Super 8\u00ae, Days Inn\u00ae, Ramada\u00ae, Microtel\u00ae, La Quinta\u00ae, Baymont\u00ae, Wingate\u00ae, AmericInn\u00ae, Hawthorn Suites\u00ae, Trademark Collection\u00ae and Wyndham\u00ae.
