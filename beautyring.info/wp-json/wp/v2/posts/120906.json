The findings were supported by a variety of experimental findings that are able to map this structure genome wide by using chemical modification of DNA in cells. These regions that can adopt alternative conformations under physiological conditions are called <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0168952519301945\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">flipons<\/a> and the algorithm they developed is called <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.life-science-alliance.org\/content\/6\/7\/e202301962\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Z-DNABERT<\/a>, Many new roles for Z-DNA in health and disease were discovered.<\/p>\n<p>The mapping allowed the researchers to ask how Z-DNA affects different traits and affects risk of mendelian diseases. They found correlative evidence that some  traits like height , body mass and lipids are connected  with the ability of particular genes to form Z-DNA in their regulatory regions . The researchers were  also able to show that Z-DNA forming regions overlap large scale deletions associated with a wide range of mendelian diseases. Specifically they found that experimentally validated flipons had a 2-9% overlap with diseases listed in the Mendelian Catalog, while there was an 8.6% overlap with those flipons that the algorithm predicted. The mendelian diseases reported affect many different genes and outcomes including HBA1 (hemoglobinopathies), CDKN2A (melanoma susceptibility), MC1R (red hair color, melanoma), WNT1 (osteogenesis imperfecta, type xv), NPHS1 (nephrotic syndrome, Type 1), SOX10 (Waardenburg syndrome, Type 2e), IDUA (Hurler\u2013Scheie syndrome), LAMB3 (heterotaxy), IL17RC (familial candidiasis), and FOXL2 (blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus, type I). Other examples noted but not examined in depth target other genes including  TERC, (the telomerase RNA) , TERT, TP53, LMNA, NKX2.5, HBA2, and NROB1 genes<\/p>\n<p>The findings add to the already established roles for left-handed Z-RNA and Z-DNA in innate immunity. In such cases, flipons activate pathways that protect self against attack by viruses. Drugs that modulate flipon conformation offer a new therapeutic avenue for the treatment of cancer. As with all new areas of research, the findings just published require more experimental evaluation to further understand their significance. However, they provide evidence that flipons impact a wide range of biological processes.<\/p>\n<p>The team at InsideOutBio was led by Alan Herbert and Maria Poptsova heads the group at the Higher School of Economics.
