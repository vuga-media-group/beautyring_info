The College Choir has maintained a robust and successful international touring schedule including performances in Lithuania, Russia, Costa Rica, the United Kingdom, and Japan.<\/p>\n<p>About The Santa Barbara Symphony Youth Ensembles Program<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMore than 100 student musicians in grades 3rd through 12th learn to collaborate, lead, and progress on their instruments through The Symphony\u2019s Youth Ensembles program. Students and families report increased academic engagement, improved social skills, and a newfound sense of accomplishment. They receive weekly rehearsals and three opportunities to perform together publicly. As part of their curriculum, students also attend performances by The Santa Barbara Symphony. The Symphony\u2019s Camerata Ensemble, led by conductor Marisa McLeod, is composed of musicians who are early in their musical training. It introduces students to the basics of ensemble playing, following a conductor, and listening across a musical group while playing.  The Philharmonia Orchestra, also led by conductor Marisa McLeod, is the second of three levels in the Symphony\u2019s Youth Ensembles\u2019 hierarchy and is designed to hone the technical skills and student musicianship required for the advanced challenges of the Youth Symphony.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe Santa Barbara Youth Symphony brings together gifted young musicians from Santa Barbara and Ventura counties to perform works across the orchestral repertoire. Directed by conductor Dr. Daniel Gee, this advanced ensemble is the culminating step in the Santa Barbara Symphony\u2019s Youth Ensembles program and instills the discipline and commitment that budding young professionals need for the next step in their careers, whether in music or another field.<\/p>\n<p>Applications for the upcoming 2024-2025 Santa Barbara Symphony Youth Ensembles season are now being accepted for all three levels, and the priority deadline is June 2, 2024. One year of experience playing an instrument and the ability to read music is required. Auditions will begin on June 15-16.
