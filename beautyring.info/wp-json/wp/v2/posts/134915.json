The book is honored as the First Place Winner in three award categories: Detective \u2013 Private Investigators &amp; Mystery, Mystery \u2013 Murder &amp; Crime, and Mystery \u2013 Spies &amp; Espionage.  <\/p>\n<p>Released by Indies United Publishing House in June, 2023, Salt Island is the second book in Towles three-book E&amp;A Investigations Series \u2013 a first person thriller series tracing the Ellwyn and Abernathy private investigations team as they confront cases involving mental illness, corporate espionage, eco-terrorism, and cutting edge technologies. <\/p>\n<p>Underlying the E&amp;A Series\u2019 mythology is Ellwyn&#8217;s endless search for her missing father, CIA operative and purported spy, this time in the British Virgin Islands. In additional to The BookFest awards, Salt Island also earned Pencraft, Readers Choice, Readers Favorite, and Literary Titan book awards this year. <\/p>\n<p>Towles says, &#8220;Being selected as a winner of The BookFest Awards, especially in three categories, is an incredible honor.
