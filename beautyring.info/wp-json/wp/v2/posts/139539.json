This number is expected to increase as more states legalize recreational use.  Public support for legalization in 2021 was at 68%. In this Gallup survey, 3 of 10 in the age 18-34 are smoking Marijuana, almost twice the rate in the 35-54 age group.  Given such a high rate of use, it is very likely that employees will show up at work impaired due to the recent use of Marijuana.  As a result, the consequences of Marijuana <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/zxerex.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">impairment<\/a> will likely become apparent in your work environment.  <\/p>\n<p>According to the National Safety Council, Marijuana use is associated with higher injury rates, higher absenteeism rates, and lower productizing.  A catastrophic event is always a distinct possibility, especially for an impaired worker in a safety-sensitive job placing coworkers, the community, and the employer at risk.  <\/p>\n<p>It is well known that the main effects of Marijuana use are said to wear off over time but that varies based on dose, duration, body size, and frequency of use.  Being able to identify the characteristics of Marijuana impairment requires training and experience.  It is complicated by the inaccuracy of rapid test kits, and uncertainties arising from more accurate drug testing performed at major laboratories that positively identify the presence of a drug but cannot determine current impairment, even when employees test positive.  <\/p>\n<p>Impairment based on observation can be readily validated by ZXEREX<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> technology developed at medical research institutions and is now available for use in the workplace environment.  <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/zxerex.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">IMPAIR-ID<\/a> powered by ZXEREX<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> is a very accurate, non-invasive, patented real-time screening system that provides actionable results.  <\/p>\n<p>When combined with an organization\u2019s in-house safety program, it can help to reduce injury rates, and absenteeism and improve productivity.  One of its very important features is its ability to personalize testing and use the individual&#8217;s unimpaired baseline results for comparison.  <\/p>\n<p>Detecting impairment is not designed to be a punitive measure.  The screening is part of a safety initiative designed to reduce risk and help to keep employees, co-workers, the public, and employers safe.<\/p>\n<p>ZXEREX<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> applies the latest in neuro and data science to enhance risk management to help ensure your employees remain safe.  <\/p>\n<p>For more information about impairment screening, especially for Marijuana, please contact a member of our safety team.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Richard Besserman, MD, CSO<br \/>ZXEREX CORPORATION<br \/>+1 480-518-9905<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/676233635\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=rqbpI1ICUPLlU5jg&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      December 21, 2023, 17:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/676233635\/increasing-marijuana-use-endangers-workplace-safety\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"channels\" dir=\"auto\">\n        Distribution channels:<br \/>\n        <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/agriculture-farming-forestry\" title=\"Agriculture, Farming &amp; Forestry Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Agriculture, Farming &amp; Forestry Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/automotive\" title=\"Automotive Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Automotive Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/aviation-aerospace\" title=\"Aviation &amp; Aerospace Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Aviation &amp; Aerospace Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/banking-finance-investment\" title=\"Banking, Finance &amp; Investment Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Banking, Finance &amp; Investment Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/books\" title=\"Book Publishing Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Book Publishing Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/building-construction\" title=\"Building &amp; Construction Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Building &amp; Construction Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/chemicals\" title=\"Chemical Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Chemical Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/electronics\" title=\"Electronics Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Electronics Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/emergency-services\" title=\"Emergency Services Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Emergency Services<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/energy\" title=\"Energy Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Energy Industry<\/a><br \/>\n        &#8230;\n      <\/div>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
