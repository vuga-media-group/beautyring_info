At times loud and bombastic, while at others, fiercely intimate, this selection is a testament to theatrical cinema\u2019s contemporary power.  <\/p>\n<p>We commend the entire team at Sydney Film Festival for this year\u2019s wonderfully curated selection of films.  We congratulate every filmmaker here, with gratitude to their tireless work.  Each film in Competition embraced the human spirit with uncompromising artistry, unafraid.  Sitting together with the audience at the gorgeously preserved State Theatre, for us this was a path breaking journey of new encounters that conjured cinematic traditions from around the world.  <\/p>\n<p>We award the prize to a film that welcomes audiences into one of the historic cradles of cinema.  Set in post-War Italy, Paola Cortellesi\u2019s debut feature, C&#8217;\u00e8 ancora domani (There\u2019s Still Tomorrow) feels intensely relevant today.  We relive every woman\u2019s struggle for equality through Cortellesi\u2019s \u201cDelia,\u201d we face the brutal cycles of domestic violence with an immense empathy that ultimately proclaims and affirms the virtues of democracy. C&#8217;\u00e8 ancora domani deftly weaves humour, style, and pop music into a dazzling black-and-white cinematic event, then it delivers an ending that will take your breath away.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A box office phenomenon in its native Italy, where it outperformed Barbie and Oppenheimer, There\u2019s Still Tomorrow is a moving, empowering melodrama about an industrious woman (played by the director herself) in post-WWII Rome. <\/p>\n<p>The Festival Jury was comprised of Bosnian writer and director Danis Tanovi\u0107 as Jury President, joined by Indonesian director Kamila Andini, Australian producer Sheila Jayadev, US producer Jay Van Hoy, and Australian director Tony Krawitz.<\/p>\n<p>Previous winners: The Mother of All Lies (2023); Close (2022); There Is No Evil (2021); Parasite (2019); The Heiresses (2018); On Body and Soul (2017); Aquarius (2016); Arabian Nights (2015); Two Days, One Night (2014); Only God Forgives (2013); Alps (2012); A Separation (2011); Heartbeats (2010); Bronson (2009); and Hunger (2008).<\/p>\n<p>The $10,000 Sydney-UNESCO City of Film Award, bestowed by Screen NSW to a trail-blazing NSW-based screen practitioner, went to producer Debbie Lee.<\/p>\n<p>City of Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore AO said, &#8220;Film delights and excites, and this year&#8217;s Sydney Film Festival brought people together to help them both escape and explain reality through the power of cinema.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The City is a proud sponsor of the Sydney Film Festival, as we believe a rich and diverse Arts culture is an essential part of every city.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Congratulations to everyone involved in staging this festival, and thank you to all the theatre-goers who supported this wonderful event.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sydney Film Festival CEO Frances Wallace said, \u201cOur 71st Sydney Film Festival has been an extraordinary success, with a remarkable turnout of film enthusiasts attending over 400 screenings, special events, and talks. This year, we showcased over 230 exceptional films from around the world, and our audiences eagerly participated in the festivities, resulting in nearly 150 sold-out sessions throughout the Festival.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Sydney Film Festival Director Nashen Moodley said, \u201cThis year, we have been privileged to showcase remarkable films from around the world, each bringing its unique voice and vision to our screens, much like the captivating Sydney Film Prize winner There\u2019s Still Tomorrow.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis has been another resoundingly successful year for the Festival.
