More than a century later, Titanic: The Exhibition \u2013 produced by Imagine Exhibitions and Fever \u2013 will open the doors in February at Westfield Old Orchard.  <\/p>\n<p>As the largest and most immersive touring Titanic exhibition, the experience is a narrative journey that brings to light the fates of the passengers and crew aboard the sinking ship, and will open on Friday, February 16, 2024 at Westfield Old Orchard (4963 Old Orchard Road) in Skokie, IL. People can join the waitlist through Fever here to gain access to tickets before they go on sale to the public December 6th. Tickets start at $29.00 for adults, with discounts for kids, seniors, military and groups. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cTitanic has been a part of my life since the late 90\u2019s when I had the incredible opportunity to dive to the wreck site, and since that firsthand experience, I\u2019ve presented hundreds of exhibitions about the ship, her people and her stories.\u201d Said Tom Zaller, President and CEO of Imagine Exhibitions   \u201cOne of the first Titanic exhibitions I was a part of was in Chicago in 2000. Over 860,000 people came to that exhibition; so many, in fact, that we returned in 2002 by popular demand and another 450,000 people came to see it. It\u2019s been more than 20 years since I\u2019ve presented a Titanic exhibition in the Chicagoland area and I\u2019m extremely excited to be returning. This story continues to fascinate people; it&#8217;s every man\u2019s story &#8211; the story of hopes and dreams. Our exhibition is designed to immerse the visitor in the history of the Titanic in a new way, with incredible media experiences and recreated environments that bring the story to life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.feverup.com\/en-US\/media_kits\/229760\/?q=titanic\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">VIEW PRESS IMAGES HERE<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Titanic: The Exhibition is an interactive exhibition that tells the chronological and dramatic tale of the design, creation, launch, maiden voyage and tragedy of the largest and most luxurious ship in the world at that time. Guests will admire hundreds of artifacts that encompass items that survived the sinking of the Titanic and her sister ships, as well as props and costumes from the beloved James Cameron 1997 blockbuster film Titanic. Set inside fully immersive re-creations of the ship&#8217;s interior, the artifacts help navigate guests through Titanic&#8217;s timeline from sinking to underwater discovery.<\/p>\n<p>Once \u201caboard,\u201d visitors will receive a boarding pass corresponding with a passenger on the ship \u2013 allowing each guest to follow an individual passenger story as they explore the first, second, and third class galleries with their corresponding artifacts. The stories of love and loss culminate in the final galleries, showcasing personal effects and individual anecdotes surrounding a tribute wall where each passenger\u2019s fate is revealed.<\/p>\n<p>Music from the era plays throughout the exhibit as patrons examine incredibly detailed recreations of the ship&#8217;s interiors including a two-story full-scale recreation of the ship\u2019s famous Grand Staircase, the first class hallway and millionaires suite, the third class hallway and cabin, the boiler room, and the ship exterior promenade deck complete with a starry night sky.<\/p>\n<p>The Discovery Gallery, dedicated to the discovery and research of the Titanic\u2019s wreckage site, features a raised glass floor; simulating the impression of walking along the ocean floor. Broken china in the sand allows visitors to experience some of what discovery teams saw during dives to the Titanic site.<\/p>\n<p>The exhibition also includes a striking and informative film that provides an in-depth look at the most recent forensic research related to the collision, breakup, and sinking of the Titanic and award-winning underwater photography of the Titanic lines the walls of the Discovery Gallery in a stunning display of the ship\u2019s current state on the seafloor.<\/p>\n<p>PRESS CONTACT<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nrebecca@bettiebomb.com <\/p>\n<p>ABOUT IMAGINE EXHIBITIONS<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAtlanta-based Imagine Exhibitions, Inc. is a world leader in narrative-driven, immersive theatrical design, story-telling, and immersive experiences, and creates sophisticated, high-quality experiences for museums, brands, venues, and integrated resorts across the globe.
