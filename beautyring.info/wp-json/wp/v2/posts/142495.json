The MDL has been assigned to the Honorable Gene E. K.

The firm has hundreds of cases currently ripe for filing in the newly created MDL and is investigating more than 1,000 others.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;While the efficacy of these drugs is great, the off-label marketing and promotion for unindicated use is rampant&#8211;like I&#8217;ve never seen,&#8221; Stephenson said. <\/p>\n<p>Defendants in these actions include Novo Nordisk, manufacturer of Ozempic, Rybelsus, and Wegovy; and Eli Lilly, maker of Mounjaro and Trulicity.<\/p>\n<p>About The Injuries Alleged in These Lawsuits<\/p>\n<p>Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus belong to a class of drugs called GLP-1 RAs. All three drugs share the same common active ingredient: semaglutide.<\/p>\n<p>This class of prescription drug is used to control high blood sugar in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The medication mimics a natural human glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) to slow the passing of food through the stomach.<\/p>\n<p>Plaintiffs in the GLP-1 RAs lawsuits allege they took these medications for rapid weight loss and then developed gastroparesis, sometimes referred to as stomach paralysis. <\/p>\n<p>Gastroparesis is an incurable medical condition in which the patient\u2019s stomach does not empty properly. <\/p>\n<p>The condition can lead to multiple complications, including dehydration from repeated vomiting, malnutrition from poor nutrient absorption, difficulty controlling blood sugar levels, and blockage, which can be life-threatening.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I predict that we are just beginning to understand the permanency that could be associated with these injuries,&#8221; Stephenson said.<\/p>\n<p>About Cameron Stephenson<\/p>\n<p>Cameron Stephenson is a shareholder at Levin, Papantonio, Rafferty. His current practice is primarily focused in Mass Tort pharmaceutical and medical device litigation.
