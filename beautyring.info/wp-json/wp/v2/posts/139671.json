Also, extended stay visitors have seen a significant 25% rise.<\/p>\n<p>While 2022 presented some challenges due to cross-industry constraints, including pilot and airplane shortages, the end-of-2023 projections for 2024 remain positive. Seat capacity has increased from the continental U.S. to 23% in St. Croix and 21% in St. Thomas, largely due to the strategy of maintaining strong relations with major carriers.<\/p>\n<p>The Department of Tourism has expanded its strategic marketing efforts leading the way for the region into sports marketing garnering partnerships with renowned sports teams and entities, including the Boston Red Sox, New York Jets, Chicago Cubs, and Klutch Sports Group.
