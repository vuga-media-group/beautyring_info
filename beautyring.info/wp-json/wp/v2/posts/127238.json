They take a fun-filled adventure to the lake, where they go fishing, swim, make friends, and show off their special powers. <\/p>\n<p>KF Wheatie, nicknamed Strawberryhead, was diagnosed with autism as a child. KF has a strong faith and works hard in school. She is currently a senior in college studying fine arts and music. KF makes it her mission to make new friends as often as possible. She plays the flute in a church band and is also a classically trained professional harpist. Her hobbies include art, Broadway, and travel.<\/p>\n<p>KM Wheatie is nicknamed Gingerbread. Because he looked like a cookie to his mother when he was little, she always pretended to take a bite out of him. His sister KF was sure that her brother would grow back after their mother took a bite out of him. Diagnosed with autism at a very young age, KM preferred to play alone as a child. It was not that he did not want to interact with other kids; he did not have the social skills necessary to play with them. He turned his love of map reading into a serious hobby. He is now a senior in college studying environmental science\/geographic information science. His hobbies include riding roller coasters, travel, and hiking.<\/p>\n<p>KF and KM Wheatie were raised by their mother, who is a staunch advocate for those with Autism Spectrum Disorder. They believe in accessibility and inclusivity for all people. <\/p>\n<p>The book is more than just an adventure tale. It is designed to teach children about friendship, inclusivity and ASD, and that all challenges children face through the adventures we know as life and growing up are stepping stones to joy, peace and harmony. Differences in children are to be celebrated \u2013 an important lesson for children to grasp, and while many children easily embrace this message, others are not so welcoming, especially at an early age.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Adventures of Strawberryhead and Gingerbread: Solomon&#8217;s Birthday Party\u201d is the second in the series starring Strawberryhead and Gingerbread, along with their black lab Solomon from S&#8217;moresville. The pair celebrates Solomon\u2019s doggie birthday with dancing, cake, and music. <\/p>\n<p>The books are perfect for kids of all ages looking to experience the sweet treat of reading and enjoy a fun-filled day of adventure.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Adventures of Strawberryhead and Gingerbread\u201d is available on <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Adventures-Strawberryhead-Gingerbread-Lake-We\/dp\/1662940068\/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1TX53CB1NCBIU&amp;keywords=The+Adventures+of+Strawberryhead+%26+Gingerbread%3A+To+the+Lake+We+Go%21&amp;qid=1689515202&amp;sprefix=the+adventures+of+strawberryhead+%26+gingerbread+to+the+lake+we+go+%2Caps%2C98&amp;sr=8-1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Amazon<\/a> and other popular retails outlets where books are sold.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.strawberryheadandgingerbread.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.strawberryheadandgingerbread.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">KF Wheatie and KM Wheatie<br \/>KF Wheatie and KM Wheatie, Authors<br \/>+1 908-300-4862<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/639306098\/mailto: strawberryheadandgingerbread@gmail.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"> strawberryheadandgingerbread@gmail.com<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/strawberryheadandgingerbread\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/strawberryheadandgingerbread\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@strawberryheadg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">TikTok<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZSiX20CzJ_M\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer sponsored\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZSiX20CzJ_M<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=1NbNCaml-YO4RP67&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      July 24, 2023, 14:15 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/639306098\/new-adventure-book-celebrates-the-special-powers-of-children\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
