The two become romantically involved and find it extremely difficult to navigate the rules of the road. The novel details their relationship and the difficulties they overcome for the relationship to blossom.<\/p>\n<p>After dark clouds burst and rain falls to the Earth, sunlight can penetrate the remaining water passing through the atmosphere to create a rainbow, signaling that the \u2018worst\u2019 (i.e., the rain) is over. The sunlight shimmering against that falling water can remind people that life experiences do not remain young and stormy and that there are calmer and brighter days coming. The relationship detailed in \u2018Rainbow\u2019 serves as an allegorical comparison to a rainbow\u2019s creation and may help inspire others while teaching them about what it was really like to live in the segregated American south.<\/p>\n<p>Life in the segregated American South during the 1960s was marked by pervasive racial discrimination, segregation laws, and social norms that enforced racial separation and inequality. The Jim Crow laws, enacted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, enforced racial segregation in public facilities, transportation, schools, and housing. These laws were particularly stringent in the Southern states, where African Americans faced systemic discrimination and were denied basic rights and opportunities. Furthermore, interracial marriage was considered illegal in many states in the United States during the 1960s. These laws, known as anti-miscegenation laws, prohibited marriage between people of different races. The exact laws and their enforcement varied by state, but they were generally part of a broader system of racial segregation and discrimination.<\/p>\n<p>The 1960s was a pivotal decade in the civil rights movement, with African Americans and allies advocating for equal rights, desegregation, and an end to racial discrimination. The Supreme Court case that ultimately struck down anti-miscegenation laws was Loving v. Virginia in 1967. In this landmark case, the Court ruled that laws prohibiting interracial marriage were unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Loving v. Virginia decision was a significant milestone in the civil rights movement and marked the end of legal barriers to interracial marriage in the United States. It affirmed the right of individuals to marry regardless of race and helped dismantle the legal framework of racial segregation and discrimination. \u2018Rainbow\u2019 explores the time prior to this groundbreaking legal case and is a pivotal read that both entrances and educates the reader.<\/p>\n<p>George is working closely with <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.inventionhome.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">InventionHome<\/a>, a leading invention licensing firm, to sell or license the rights to his novel, \u2018Rainbow\u2019.
