They\u2019re inviting anyone in the world to mail in their hair and help set a new world record. <\/p>\n<p>Chris Healy and Lindsay Barto are the founders &#8211; and the hair &#8211; behind The Longhairs, established in 2014 to inspire confidence in men with long hair, redefine what masculinity can be, advocate for hair equality (yes &#8211; men with long hair do look professional), and celebrate men\u2019s long manes with hair whips and tips &#8211; plus a lot of high fives.\t<\/p>\n<p>Long hair defines these men, BUT\u2026..now Chris and Lindsay are leading a global community of men, women and families who will cut and donate their locks to help children. In 2019 The Great Cut broke the World Record for the most hair donated to charity, sending it all to Children With Hair Loss (CWHL), a non-profit providing 600+ wigs a year to children with medical hair loss. This year, The Longhairs will send hair donations from The Great Cut to the same organization they have supported for over seven years. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing to me that the very thing that defines The Longhairs is what they are willing to give up to help children in need. That is just extraordinary,\u201d says Regina Villemure, the Founder of Children With Hair Loss. \u201cSince Chris and Lindsay began supporting us in 2017 &#8211; they just give and give and give. They give of their money &#8211; 1% of their revenue &#8211; and they also give of their time and their passion. They really care about these kids and they are so connected to them. Each time they and others cut their hair, they spread awareness about hair loss in children and gain insight into what it\u2019s like to have your hair one day and not the next. That seems to inspire them to give all the more, and we are so grateful.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Great Cut 2024 will attempt to break the previous world record for the most hair donated to charity in 24 hours. Over 1,300 hair donors, stylists, volunteers, and guests participated in the 2019 event. Mail-in hair donations came from nearly every state in the U.S. and a dozen countries as far away as Australia and Japan. As a result, The Longhairs received and donated more than 2,834 individual hair donations &#8212;  339 pounds of hair \u2013 setting a World Record that still stands today and one The Longhairs intend to beat in March. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s taken 5 looooong years for us &#8211; and all the others participating in this event &#8211; to grow our hair back, and now we\u2019re ready to cut it off again,\u201d explains The Longhairs CEO Chris Healy, who plans to get a buzz cut so he can donate 28+ inches. \u201cWe are committed to helping kids who lose their hair, whether it\u2019s from cancer, autoimmune disease, burn injuries or more. Of the three things we hold dear &#8211; our hair, our time and our money &#8211; we give them each freely and happily to Children With Hair Loss.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lindsay Barto, the President of The Longhairs, who got a buzzcut in 2019 and plans to cut at least 14 inches this year, says there is a whole community of men with long hair eager to break preconceived notions and stereotypes, and help others. \u201cA lot of people ask us why we need a community for men with long hair &#8211; and there are so many reasons. For us, it started with products and resources. There\u2019s nothing wrong with shampoo that smells like flowers and hair ties that are pink &#8211; but a lot of men were looking for something else, and it didn\u2019t exist until we created our grooming line,\u201d Barto says. \t\t\t<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s about so much more than that,\u201d he continues. \u201cMen with long hair have to fight so many misconceptions like we\u2019re lazy hippies with bad grooming standards who can\u2019t hold down a job. Building this community is about celebrating and supporting each other while expanding people\u2019s views about what good men look like. We\u2019re using our platform to showcase and model a genuine and positive masculinity that believes in helping and giving of ourselves, and when a community like this comes together to make a sacrifice to help others &#8211; it\u2019s powerful.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>CWHL has provided nearly 10,000 human hair replacements to children experiencing hair loss from cancer, autoimmune conditions, burn injuries, and more. They don\u2019t charge or turn a child away. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe donations made through The Great Cut are so important,\u201d Healy explains. \u201cThey make an enormous difference for children and families because human hair replacements are very difficult to find in children\u2019s sizes, and they are extremely expensive &#8211; often starting at $1,500 and going up from there. Also, health insurance doesn\u2019t cover hair replacements; children often need new ones as they grow. We\u2019re honored to give our hair.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Come to The Great Cut in San Diego<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDonate your hair\u2014or help cut hair\u2014at the biggest hair-cutting party of 2024.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nWhen: Saturday, March 16, 2024 &#8211; 8:30 AM &#8211; 10 PM<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nWhere: The Port Pavilion on Broadway Pier, 1000 N.
