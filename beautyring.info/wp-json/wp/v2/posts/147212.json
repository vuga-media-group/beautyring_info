Constructed of real granite, the well is a replica of the infamous well in the movie, and is uncannily realistic. The well features the gruesome markings from the movie, including bloody fingernail scratches along the inner wall. Brave guests can physically enter into the four foot deep well for gruesome photo opps. Upon entering the interactive well set, guests will be greeted by sounds of dripping water along with sound clips from the film of the victim Catherine Martin (played by Brooke Smith) screaming for her life. There is a jumpsuit and curly haired wig which guests are encouraged to wear to get into character as the famous movie hostage. Additional props include a stuffed animal \u201cPrecious,\u201d the killer&#8217;s dog, a bucket, complete with lotion, which can be raised and lowered, as well knob &amp; tube lighting to add to the eerie effect. To complete the chilling scene, there is also a hose for guests who want to channel Buffalo Bill\u2019s character.<\/p>\n<p>The well was built in partnership with legendary special effects make-up artist, and lifelong Pittsburgh resident, Tom Savini. Tom commissioned the Douglas Education Center, where he runs the Tom Savini Special Make-up Effects program, to create the incredible well. It was built by both faculty and students of Savini\u2019s program.<\/p>\n<p>The interactive well set complements \u2018Buffalo Bill\u2019s Workshop of Horrors,\u2019 also in the basement of the house, where Rowan (who is an art director and prop stylist by profession) has re-created the famous Buffalo Bill\u2019s dance set from the film complete with vintage Singer sewing machine, disco ball, four female mannequins dressed to resemble the ones in the movie, as well as a full length mirror and Buffalo Bill style kimono for guests\u2019 use, designed to help fans \u201cget their tuck on\u201d while they live out their Buffalo Bill fantasies.  As fans enter the basement, &#8220;Goodbye Horses,\u201d the haunting song that plays during the famous Buffalo Bill dance scene, goes on auto play.<\/p>\n<p>In the attic, Rowan has designed what he calls \u2018Buffalo Bill\u2019s Playhouse,\u2019 a full retro-inspired game room that features a large screen TV complete with a 600+ library of select 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s films on DVD and VHS to enjoy.  A self-described fan of \u2018physical media,\u2019 Rowan has also tricked out the Playhouse with a host of full-sized classic arcade video games including Asteroids, Pac Man, Super Street Fighter, Terminator 2, Galaga, NBA Jam and Crazy Taxi. More recent video game additions to the collection include Mortal Kombat, The Simpsons, Centipede and Final Fight. There&#8217;s even a pool table.<\/p>\n<p>The Silence of the Lambs memorabilia is on display throughout the home, including original artwork by fans, real taxidermy deaths-head moths, an original copy of the production blueprints of the house, a call sheet that was issued to the cast and crew, and even two production utilized pieces of wallpaper, which were screen-used in The Silence of the Lambs. <\/p>\n<p>Exclusive Buffalo Bill\u2019s House gift souvenirs and apparel are available for purchase at the conclusion of the tour. Buffalo Bill\u2019s House is introducing four new merchandise items: A scented \u201cSkin Suit Fresh\u201d dual wick candle (burns 150 hours), a \u201cSilence of the Jams\u201d loose leaf black tea set complete with heart-sharped tea infuser with deaths-head moth charm, a new soap bar line featuring six scented bars with unique scenes from the film imbedded in the soap and deaths-heads moth hair clips.<\/p>\n<p>These new items join the popular branded items including T-Shirts, Hooded Sweatshirts, \u2018Skin Suit Soft\u2019 Body Lotion, Coffee Mugs, \u201cPrecious\u201d stuffed animals, Enamel Pins, Lip Balm, Magnets, Tote Bags, and \u2018Get Your Tuck On\u2019 Bumper Stickers, and a limited number of real taxidermy Death\u2019s-Head Moths set in a gilded frame against a Buffalo Bill\u2019s House backdrop. <\/p>\n<p>All of the merchandise items are also available for purchase at the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/buffalobillshouse.com\/shop\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">online gift store<\/a>.
