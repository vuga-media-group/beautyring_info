The licensed master social worker affectionately known as \u201cProfessor Pia\u201d is the voice actor in the short film \u201c<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/anarchaeologyofdisability.com\/en\/semata\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Semata<\/a>,\u201d featured in the European-touring exhibit, \u201c<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/anarchaeologyofdisability.com\/en\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">An Archaeology of Disability<\/a>.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>Debuting in 2021 at the Italian cultural institution Venice Biennale, \u201cAn Archaeology of Disability\u201d curated by David Gissen, Jennifer Stager, and Mantha Zarmakoupi presents a reconstruction of the Greek Acropolis as it examines the challenges of historic preservation and physical accessibility. Ironically, the famed tourist attraction is less accessible now than it was in ancient times. The creative concept and profound look at the World Heritage Site continue to spark conversation within the academic community.<\/p>\n<p>For Hargrove, the project has created an evolution within her own body of work. This summer, Professor Pia will amplify awareness about the intersection of social work, political activism, art history, and disability studies with her presentation, \u201cA Seat at the Propylaia\u201d at Princeton University\u2019s workshop, \u201cMaking a Place: Grounding the Reception of Greco-Roman Antiquity in Modern and Contemporary Art and Archaeological Practice.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>Princeton University\u2019s Susan Dod Brown Professor of Classics, Brooke Holmes and professor and sculptor, Martha Friedman will host scholars and advanced doctoral students to present experimental and transdisciplinary methods for classical reception studies, art history, and curatorial studies. The two-day seminar held at the Princeton Athens Center for Research and Hellenic Studies will examine how modern and contemporary artists, archaeologists, and thinkers engage with Greco-Roman Mediterranean antiquities. <\/p>\n<p>According to Hargrove, the workshop is a fitting environment to discuss the key principles of \u201cAn Archaeology of Disability\u201d and \u201cSemata.\u201d The exhibit helps visitors understand that although discussion about human disability in modern times is often a politically charged subject, people with disabilities have existed and been engaged in activism throughout history. The inclusion of stories and experiences of people with disabilities are impactful and necessary for analyzing the past as any other medium.  <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs people experience the film, they learn that ancient Athenians representing people of all ages and abilities worked together to reach the Acropolis summit,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the modern world, however, we are challenged to examine how we ascend as a community. An important lesson we can take away from those who lived centuries ago is how they held each other accountable as they evolved and ascended together with dignity and humanity.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Hargrove\u2019s previous transdisciplinary work post film narration included a live question and answer session with disabled dancer and writer Jerron Herman at the screening of his film \u201cVITRUVIAN\u201d at the Maryland Institute College of Art last February, a collaboration with Johns Hopkins University and the Baltimore Museum of Art. She further collaborated with the artist for a guest lecture at Princeton University\u2019s Spring doctoral course, \u201cPhase Change: Ancient Matter and Contemporary Making.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>Professor Pia is projected to co-author and publish a dialogic essay on \u201cAn Archeology of Disability,\u201d in the peer reviewed journal, Classical Antiquity this fall. <\/p>\n<p>About Professor Pia Hargrove: New York licensed master social worker Pia Hargrove is an award-winning educator, speaker, and activist with over two decades of experience serving diverse communities.
