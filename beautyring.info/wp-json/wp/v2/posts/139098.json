These natural and biodiverse wonders are weakened by climate change, thus losing their life and colors.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith the mission to revolutionize ocean conservation and create a global movement to save the world\u2019s coral reefs through active reef restoration, we are very proud to partner with Warner Bros. on the release of the movie \u201cAquaman and the Lost Kingdom,\u201d as Aquaman is literally the ocean Super Hero and has the power to rally audiences to our mission, \u201d explains Titouan Bernicot, Founder &amp; CEO of Coral Gardeners. \u201cJason Momoa, Aquaman himself, has been a longtime supporter of ocean conservation and an ambassador of our project. He had the opportunity to discover our activities in French Polynesia and take part in coral gardening with us. He is not only a great actor embodying a Super Hero, he is also a true advocate for the ocean.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>With more than 75,000 corals planted since its creation in 2017, Coral Gardeners\u2019 aim is to scale up reef restoration around the world with the goal of 1 million corals planted by 2025, by empowering the local communities to become coral gardeners as part of a global movement.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe partnership with Coral Gardeners around the release of \u201cAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\u201d is another example of Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s commitment to positively impacting communities and contributing to environmental solutions through our global impact campaigns,\u201d said Xavier Petit, Head of EMEA Brand Partnerships at Warner Bros. Discovery. \u201cTogether with audiences around the world, we can take part in wildlife conservation by bringing corals\u2019 vibrant colors back into the ocean.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>From Dec 12th to Dec 22nd, everyone can join the movement and donate to Coral Gardeners on <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/coralgardeners.org\/pages\/thelostcolors\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/coralgardeners.org\/pages\/thelostcolors<\/a> in order to not only bring back life and colors to the ocean, but also to watch the \u201cAquaman and the Lost Kingdom\u201d trailer restored back to color, in full effect. <\/p>\n<p>All participants who donate to the \u201cThe Lost Colors\u201d activation will automatically be entered into a contest* to win an original art piece of Aquaman signed by James Wan. <\/p>\n<p>Synopsis of movie: <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHaving failed to defeat Aquaman the first time, Black Manta, still driven by the need to avenge his father&#8217;s death, will stop at nothing to take Aquaman down once and for all. This time Black Manta is more formidable than ever before, wielding the power of the mythic Black Trident, which unleashes an ancient and malevolent force. To defeat him, Aquaman will turn to his imprisoned brother Orm, the former King of Atlantis, to forge an unlikely alliance. Together, they must set aside their differences in order to protect their kingdom and save Aquaman&#8217;s family, and the world, from irreversible destruction.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Lost Colors\u201d activation:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nCreative agency: Ores <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nWeb agency: Cher Ami <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nPartnership and communication: Wonder Stories <\/p>\n<p>About Coral Gardeners<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nCoral Gardeners started in 2017 on Mo\u2019orea, in French Polynesia after a small group of ocean kids \u2013 young surfers, freedivers, and fishermen \u2013 witnessed the rapid degradation of their home reef only to realize the extent of this global crisis. <\/p>\n<p>Today, Coral Gardeners has grown into a multidisciplinary team of more than 50 members, gathering around them a global movement of advocates, scientists, engineers, creators and business partners, all determined to revolutionize ocean conservation and save coral reefs.
