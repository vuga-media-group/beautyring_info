In April of this year, the BSA emerged from bankruptcy, resulting in a $2.46 billion sexual abuse settlement, the largest of its kind in U.S. history. As survivors now navigate the settlement process, many questions linger: How could such heinous abuse within the BSA be perpetrated for decades without consequence? How have these crimes affected survivors and their families? What can we do to better protect children, hold offenders and institutions accountable, and improve access to justice for survivors?<\/p>\n<p>Survivors who were victimized within or outside the BSA and choose to watch the documentary might experience traumatic memories and feelings of sadness, anger, or betrayal. Some who have never told anyone about their past abuse may feel inspired to come forward. Loved ones of survivors may feel agitated or helpless. These responses are valid, and survivors are not alone in how they feel. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a survivor of sexual abuse in scouting, the powerful testimony of the men in the documentary resonated with me,\u201d said Zero Abuse Project CEO, Jeff Dion. \u201cI want to tell every survivor that it was not their fault, and that no matter how long they have held this secret, it is never too late to seek help.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For information and resources created by survivors, for survivors, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.survivorspace.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.survivorspace.org<\/a>.
