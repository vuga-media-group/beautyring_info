The motion : 2:23-cv-01495-JHC was filed on the eve of Independent Bookstore Day, the national celebration of independent bookstores. The intervention is made in support of the FTC\u2019s case and looks to bolster its claim that Amazon is guilty of unlawful exclusionary conduct by explicitly including the concerns of independent booksellers in the case. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn 1994, the year Amazon launched, there were 7,000 independent bookstores in the U.S. Today there are only 2,500,\u201d said Allison K Hill, ABA CEO. \u201cThe ABA believes our motion to intervene will help the FTC\u2019s efforts to stop Amazon\u2019s exclusionary conduct that has hurt small business, the book industry, and ultimately consumers. We\u2019re not talking about simply an unlevel playing field; left unchecked for almost 30 years, Amazon now owns the playing field and sets the rules of the game. As independent bookstores\u2019 biggest competitor, Amazon\u2019s exclusionary conduct directly impacting independent booksellers must be addressed explicitly in this suit. We believe the facts we bring to the table will significantly bolster key arguments made by the FTC in their already strong and compelling case. We applaud FTC\u2019s efforts to release Amazon\u2019s stranglehold on the marketplace.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In late September 2023, the FTC and 17 state Attorneys General (now 18 after Vermont joined) filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, alleging that the online retail and technology company is a monopolist that uses a set of interlocking anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power. The FTC and its state partners claim Amazon\u2019s actions allow it to stop rivals and sellers from lowering prices, degrade quality for shoppers, overcharge sellers, stifle innovation, and prevent rivals from fairly competing against Amazon. <\/p>\n<p>Notably missing from the complaint, however, are independent bookstores, a key competitor of Amazon\u2019s for well over three decades now \u2014 and one of the first commercial sectors to feel the impact of Amazon\u2019s monopolistic practices. <\/p>\n<p>A motion to intervene can be filed by any party who shares an interest in the outcome of a case that may not be protected without adequate representation by existing parties. In the motion to intervene, ABA argues: \u201cAmazon has stifled such competition by ABA members by exercising its monopoly power to coerce publishers to accede to its demands for substantial and unjustified price discrimination, enabling Amazon to sell books to retail customers at prices that ABA members cannot match except by forgoing a sustainable margin, or incurring a loss, given the higher wholesale prices concurrently paid by ABA members for the same books.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis challenge to Amazon\u2019s anticompetitive behavior impacting independent booksellers has been a long time coming,\u201d said David Grogan, Director, Advocacy &amp; Public Policy. \u201cNo one knows that better than ABA\u2019s members, who, for decades, have persistently called out Amazon\u2019s monopolistic and monopsonistic practices in bookselling. We believe the law is firmly on our side and that our motion will be accepted by the court. As such, Amazon\u2019s anticompetitive behavior impacting the bookselling industry can finally come under legal scrutiny.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If ABA\u2019s motion to intervene is denied, the association has requested amicus status in support of the FTC\u2019s complaint.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Ray Daniels<br \/>American Booksellers Association<br \/>+1 202-669-3039<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/707416426\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/americanbooksellers\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/americanbooksellers\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=1TaGbwLMovP547jO&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      April 29, 2024, 18:51 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/707416426\/aba-files-motion-to-intervene-in-ftc-suit-against-amazon\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
