Ron Hubbard<\/a>, employing authentic and lifelike sound effects which captivated and immersed everyone into the circus fantasy. <\/p>\n<p>Ahead of his time, L. Ron Hubbard exposed discrimination and bullying in this telling story published in the February 1940 issue of Five Novels Monthly. The voice of world-renowned cartoon character Bart Simpson, Nancy Cartwright performed Little Tom Little, a circus midget who undergoes extreme discrimination because he is \u201cdifferent\u201d and not \u201cnormal.\u201d Desperate to change his identity and become respected and classed as \u201cnormal,\u201d Little Tom Little discovers a book on black magic and learns how to switch bodies. But when he jumps into the body of the greedy and lustful ringmaster, Herman Schmidt, performed by Jim Meskimen (Deadshot, Ultron, and Genie), he discovers switching bodies means he must also take on the personality, sins, debts, and enemies of his new identity. Ultimately, he finds the value in being himself.<\/p>\n<p>The cast in alphabetical order: Neil Angevine (American Crime Story) as Jerry Gordon; Nancy Cartwright as Little Tom Little; Robert F.
