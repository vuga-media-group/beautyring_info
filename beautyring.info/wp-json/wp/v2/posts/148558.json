Specializing in collectible signed limited edition hardcover books, our goal is to showcase authors&#8217; works in beautiful, limited editions. From both new, up-and-coming authors to veterans of the genre, we publish some of the best in the field including Brian Keene, Joe Lansdale, Christopher Golden, Philip Fracassi, Tyler Jones, Ross Jeffery, Chad Lutzke, Cynthia Pelayo, Jeff Strand, Hailey Piper, Paul Tremblay, Edward Lee, Kealan Patrick Burke, Jonathan Janz, Samantha Kolesnik, Gabino Iglesias, Adam Cesare, Kristopher Triana, Richard Chizmar, Gwendolyn Kiste, Wrath James White, and Ronald Kelly.

Matthews.<\/p>\n<p>The Richard Laymon President\u2019s Award for Service was instituted in 2001 and is named in honor of Richard Laymon, who died in 2001 while serving as HWA\u2019s President. As its name implies, it is given by HWA\u2019s sitting President.<\/p>\n<p>The award is presented to a volunteer who has served the HWA in an especially exemplary manner and has shown extraordinary dedication to the organization.<\/p>\n<p>Brian W. Matthews is the author of several books, including the popular Forever Man series. He\u2019s also authored numerous short stories, the most recent of which have appeared in Weird Tales and Space &amp; Time magazines. He has been a member of the Horror Writers Association since 2012 and has served as a trustee of the organization since 2020. Among his duties as a trustee, Brian has co-chaired three StokerCon<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> conventions, acts as the Bram Stoker Award<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> Show Coordinator, and organizes the Pitch Sessions for StokerCon. He has previously been awarded the Silver Hammer Award, now renamed the Karen Lansdale Silver Hammer Award.<\/p>\n<p>Brian holds a graduate degree in clinical psychology and worked for twenty years as a therapist, primarily for children and adolescents. He currently works as a financial planner. He lives with his wife, Sue, in southeast Michigan.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n_______________________________________________<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe Karen Lansdale Silver Hammer Award<\/p>\n<p>The recipient of the Karen Lansdale Silver Hammer Award is Lila Denning.<\/p>\n<p>In 2022, the Horror Writers Association renamed the Silver Hammer Award to the Karen Lansdale Silver Hammer Award in honor of the tremendous amount of work Karen did starting the HWA.<\/p>\n<p>Our physical award has also been updated. Instead of a hammer, a new stylized sculpture has been designed and cast by the same company that mints our Bram Stoker Award statues. <\/p>\n<p>The HWA periodically gives the Karen Lansdale Silver Hammer Award to an HWA volunteer who has done a truly massive amount of work for the organization, often unsung and behind the scenes. It was instituted in 1996 and is decided by a vote of HWA\u2019s Board of Trustees.<\/p>\n<p>The award is so named because it represents the careful, steady, continuous work of building HWA\u2019s \u201chouse\u201d\u2014the many institutional systems that keep the organization functioning on a day-to-day basis.<\/p>\n<p>Lila Denning is the acquisitions coordinator for the seven libraries of the St. Petersburg (FL) Library System. Lila has worked in circulation and reference and has done programming for children, teens, and adults. Beyond her current role in her library, she trains librarians nationwide on passive reader advisory. Her long, rambling road to the library included stops as a manager of a comic book store, a manager at Barnes and Noble, and a stint at a brokerage firm, among other adventures. In addition to her MLIS, Lila has an MA in Religious Studies with a focus on Holocaust Studies. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n_______________________________________________<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMentor of the Year Award<\/p>\n<p>The recipient of the Mentor of the Year Award is Lisa Wood.<\/p>\n<p>The HWA\u2019s Mentor Program is available to all members of the organization. This popular program pairs newer writers with established professionals for an intensive four-month-long partnership. For new writers, the Program offers mentees a personal, one-on-one experience with a seasoned writer, tailor-made to help them grow in their writing and better market their work. For experienced writers, it is an opportunity to pay forward the assistance and encouragement other writers gave them when they were starting out. In addition, there is the added benefit of growing as a writer oneself through the act of teaching others. In short, the Program benefits all who participate, regardless of their roles.<\/p>\n<p>Established in 2014, the Mentor of the Year Award recognizes one mentor in the Program who has done an outstanding job of helping new writers. The award is chosen by the current manager of the Program.<\/p>\n<p>L.
