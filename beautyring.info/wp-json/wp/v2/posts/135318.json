That first movement began in the early 1800\u2019s with a group of New York painters who were moved by the landscape around them. Ivey Abitz pays homage to the bucolic and majestic landscapes of New York\u2019s Hudson Valley that inspired these artists two hundred years ago. <\/p>\n<p>For her new collection, Ivey Abitz set out to examine what Hudson River School founder Thomas Cole and his contemporaries found of value within the landscapes they painted. She painted landscapes of New York\u2019s Hudson River Valley and the Great Lakes Region, just as they often painted. She set her brush to canvas within the actual landscapes, with her own visual language, to further connect with the ideals the Hudson River School conveyed so long ago. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI gave myself a timeframe for each painting I created, finishing each painting in the amount of time it takes us to create one Ivey Abitz garment from start to finish,\u201d Cynthia Ivey Abitz said. <\/p>\n<p>Ivey Abitz\u2019s creative process led her to ask questions: What is the difference between painting a landscape and creating a garment to wear? If they take the same amount of time to create, are they of the same value? Is one more valuable than the other, simply because it hangs on a wall? Or is a garment more valuable because of its everyday usefulness? <\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s culture of throwaway fast-fashion clothing, it\u2019s easy to jump to the conclusion that a painting is far more valuable than a garment. <\/p>\n<p>Designer Ivey Abitz said, \u201cAs an artist who creates both paintings and garments, I challenge all of us to rethink the value of garments. Paintings, too, for that matter. In a world where mass-production churns out so much substandard clothing and so many incidental images that it makes my head spin, it\u2019s easy to overlook the specialness and profundity of something made by hand with thought, care, and time. In a world being overtaken by artificial intelligence, what does it mean to have someone\u2019s spirit guide each stitch and every brushstroke?\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Cynthia Ivey Abitz says the landscape she lives in\u2014the Hudson Valley&#8211;inspired her to create the new Autumn Winter collection of Ivey Abitz garments. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Hudson River School\u2019s intent was to celebrate the idyllic qualities and hopefulness of a landscape,\u201d Ivey Abitz explains. \u201cI connect with this purpose in such a deep way, as this is at the core of every collection of garments I create. I want to live within an idyll of peace each and every day, and every one of my garment designs strives to create such a place.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The design house Ivey Abitz has long been a proponent of creating from ideals, and that is what\u2019s behind its new art movement. The movement values art and products created by the human hand over mass production. Ivey Abitz tries to create quality and meaningful things within a world that it says has become banal and saturated with mass-produced sameness. This new art movement values what is created by the human spirit and mind over computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. <\/p>\n<p>Cynthia Ivey Abitz says she put this collection of ideals out into the world believing that there are others who seek to invest in something of quality, made by hand. She hopes that those who are seeking unique clothing and authentic art will find it. <\/p>\n<p>Ivey Abitz adds, \u201cIf you believe in this new art movement, too, I hope you will embrace yourself with a lifetime of Ivey Abitz garments.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Ivey Abitz is a New York based clothing design company specializing in bespoke clothing for women. It is sold exclusively through the company\u2019s website IveyAbitz.com. The Autumn Winter collection also offers for sale gicl\u00e9e prints of the original Ivey Abitz landscape paintings.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Josh Ivey Abitz<br \/>Ivey Abitz Artists<br \/>+1 888-933-9796<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/663683492\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/facebook.com\/iveyabitz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/iveyabitz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/iveyabitz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/IveyAbitzMovies\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/pinterest.com\/iveyabitz\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Other<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">A New American Art Movement<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/875814232?app_id=122963\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" title=\"Hessian Lake Painting w Looks\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=54LpELO8xXMSWZVn&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      October 30, 2023, 15:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/663683492\/clothing-designer-uses-paintings-to-declare-a-new-american-art-movement\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
