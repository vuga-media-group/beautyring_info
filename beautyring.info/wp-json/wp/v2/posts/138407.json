From December 14-16, the symposium titled, &#8220;Colorful Threads: The Interwoven Worlds of Art and Culture in the Western Indian Ocean.&#8221; will take place in Sharjah and will include performances and four-panel discussions led by scholars around the world. The panel topics include Women, Feminism and the Indian Ocean, Material Connections and Rupture, Cinema and Placemaking, and Representations and Imaginaries. Free and open to the public, the conference will also be live streamed on their official YouTube page. The schedule of programs and panelists will be available at TheAfricaInstitute.org.<\/p>\n<p>Colorful Threads revolves around the Islands of the Western Indian Ocean region, stretching from the Eastern African coasts of Kenya, Mozambique, Somalia, South Africa, and Tanzania to Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, Mayotte, and Reunion, each brimming with historical, socio-cultural, and economic significances. These Islands are not only creolized entities, but also important sites of creativity and imagination as evidenced in both symbolic and material cultures such as those expressed in the diversity of languages, ethnicities, rites, and performances, among other artistic forms of human expressions. <\/p>\n<p>Nowhere have the influences of the Indian Ocean circularities been more powerfully pronounced than in the aesthetic realms of art and cultural production. From the vast array of the rich artistic traditions of music, photography, theatre, dance, ritual life, and spirit possession performances to mention a few, this symposium\u2019s angle on art and cultural production will pivot around key subjects of critical importance to scholars in the humanities and the social sciences.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBounded by the continents of Africa, Asia, and Australia, the Indian Ocean has been a critical route for centuries bearing witness to remarkable circularities. With this season\u2019s focus, diverse scholars highlight the multitudinous forces shaping Africa\u2019s Indian Ocean islands, enabling us to interpret Africa\u2019s history, understand its present, and imagine its future,\u201d said Dr. Salah M Hassan, Director, The Africa Institute Sharjah.<\/p>\n<p>Colorful Threads is part of a four-part conference season titled Thinking the Archipelago: Africa\u2019s Indian Ocean Islands, organized by The Africa Institute in collaboration with leading scholars Jeremy Prestholdt, Professor of History at the University of California, San Diego; Rogaia Mustafa Abusharaf, Professor of Anthropology, Georgetown University in Qatar; and Uday Chandra, Assistant Professor of Government, Georgetown University in Qatar. This symposium is co-organized by Prita Meier, Associate Professor of Art History at New York University, and Laura Fair, Professor of African History in the Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies at Columbia University.<\/p>\n<p>Following two successful seasons focused on Ethiopia and Ghana in 2019 and 2022, respectively, The Africa Institute chose the Indian Ocean region due to its significance as the \u2018cradle of globalization\u2019 and \u2018center stage\u2019 in the contemporary multipolar world . This season invites scholars, activists, and others to center Africa within studies of global relations and aims to raise the profile of Indian Ocean societies, bringing the complex history and rich cultural heritage of the Indian Ocean to an international audience. The Indian Ocean season thus far has completed two successful iterations dedicated to Africa&#8217;s Indian Ocean rim with themes on &#8220;Reimagining Mobilities\/Immobilities in the Indian Ocean&#8221;, which took place in December 2022 in Sharjah, UAE, followed by &#8220;Legacies of Race and Slavery in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans&#8221;, held between June 12-14, 2023 in Zanzibar. The final conference of the Indian Ocean season titled &#8220;Intertwined Ecologies and Interconnected Histories: The Indian Ocean Rim&#8221; will be held in Mauritius in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>The Africa Institute (GSU), created this annual series to highlight the complex history of the African world while also providing a forum for creatively engaging its present and imagining new futures. Inaugurated with Ethiopia: Modern Nation\/Ancient Roots in 2019-2020 followed by Global Ghana in 2021-2022, the country-focused seasons are an integral part of The Africa Institute\u2019s year-round work to develop and support original scholarship and programming that expands understanding of African and African diaspora studies among the academic community and the broader public. <\/p>\n<p>About The Africa Institute (GSU)<\/p>\n<p>Established in 2018, The Africa Institute (Global Studies University, GSU) in Sharjah, UAE, is an interdisciplinary academic research institute dedicated to the study, research, and documentation of Africa and the African diaspora.
