Lazarou\u2019s hair extensions technicians provide a range of options to achieve a client&#8217;s desired look safely and effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Premier Hair Extension Services<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cAt Lazarou, we understand the transformative power of hair extensions.

The small bonds blend seamlessly with natural hair, providing a natural look and feel.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; **Tape Extensions:** Ideal for clients looking for a quick and easy application, tape extensions are gentle on the hair and can be reused, making them a cost-effective choice.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8211; **Weave\/weft Extensions:** Known for their durability, weave extensions are perfect for clients with thick hair and those looking for a fuller look.<\/p>\n<p>These are frequently asked questions about hair extensions by clients:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n**How long do hair extensions last?**<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe lifespan of hair extensions varies depending on the type and care. Generally, nano and micro bond hair extensions last between 8-10 weeks, tape hair extensions and weave\/weft extensions can last up to 6-8 weeks with proper maintenance. Lazarou&#8217;s team provides comprehensive aftercare advice to help clients maintain their extensions and prolong their lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>**Are hair extensions bad for your hair?**<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nWhen applied and maintained correctly, hair extensions should not damage the natural hair. Hair extensions specialists at Lazarou are trained to ensure that extensions are applied in a way that minimises stress on the hair and scalp. The use of high-quality hair and the latest application techniques ensure the health and integrity of the client&#8217;s natural hair.<\/p>\n<p>**Do hair extensions require a lot of maintenance?**<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHair extensions do require regular maintenance to keep them looking their best. This includes gentle washing, a sulphate-free shampoo and conditioner, avoiding excessive heat, and regular salon visits for adjustments and care. Lazarou&#8217;s team provide detailed aftercare instructions to help manage your extensions easily at home.<\/p>\n<p>**Can hair extensions match my natural hair colour?**<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nYes, hair extensions come in a wide range of colours and can be custom-matched to natural hair. At Lazarou, clients can book a free consultation to find the perfect colour match, ensuring a seamless blend with their natural hair.<\/p>\n<p>**Will hair extensions cause my natural hair to thin?**<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nIf applied and maintained properly, hair extensions should not cause the natural hair to thin. It is important to follow aftercare instructions and to avoid pulling or tugging on the extensions to maintain the health of the natural hair.<\/p>\n<p>**Are there any restrictions on activities with hair extensions?**<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nWhile clients can continue most of their regular activities with hair extensions, it is advised to avoid excessive exposure to chlorine and saltwater, as these can affect the longevity and quality of the extensions.<\/p>\n<p>About Lazarou<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nLazarou Hair Group, a prominent fixture in South Wales&#8217; hairdressing scene, continues to set the standard for excellence and innovation.
