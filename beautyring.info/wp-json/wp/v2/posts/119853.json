Only properties rated 3 stars or more and situated near to a beach or city\/town center were included in the survey&#8217;s findings.<br class=\"dnr\"><br class=\"dnr\">In <span class=\"xn-location\">Charleston<\/span>, guests will have to pay an average of <span class=\"xn-money\">$358<\/span> per night for the cheapest double room. Meanwhile, two Hawaiian resort towns, <span class=\"xn-location\">Lahaina<\/span> and Wailea, emerged as the second and third priciest destinations, with average rates of <span class=\"xn-money\">$338<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-money\">$312<\/span>, respectively.<br class=\"dnr\"><br class=\"dnr\">At <span class=\"xn-money\">$294<\/span> per night, <span class=\"xn-person\">Anna Maria Island<\/span> was shown to be <span class=\"xn-location\">Florida&#8217;s<\/span> most expensive destination, placing it 5<sup>th<\/sup> overall. <span class=\"xn-location\">Napa<\/span> and neighboring <span class=\"xn-location\">Calistoga<\/span> came out as the priciest destinations in <span class=\"xn-location\">California<\/span>, with average rates of <span class=\"xn-money\">$290<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-money\">$284<\/span>, respectively.<br class=\"dnr\"><br class=\"dnr\">When placed against rates in spring 2022, prices appear to have come down this year. In <span class=\"xn-location\">Charleston<\/span>, for example, guests last spring had to dig deep for <span class=\"xn-money\">$374<\/span> for the cheapest room \u2013 <span class=\"xn-money\">$16<\/span> more than this year. What&#8217;s more, in some destinations, rates have plummeted even further. \u00a0<br class=\"dnr\"><br class=\"dnr\">Indeed, overall average hotel rates in the 20 priciest spring destinations have dropped 11% this year, according to the survey. This suggests that demand for hotel stays has also shrunk compared with spring 2022, when accommodation rates across the board surged following the dramatically reduced economic activity of 2020 and 2021 resulting from COVID-19 restrictions. \u00a0<br class=\"dnr\"><br class=\"dnr\">The table below shows the 10 priciest destinations for accommodation in the US this spring.
