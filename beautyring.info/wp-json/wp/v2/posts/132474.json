Every day he is faced with reminders of the Holocaust as he walks his French Bulldog, Hamilton, through the streets of Regensburg, Germany, which was a beehive of Nazi activity during World War II.<\/p>\n<p>This 2 hour event will include a red carpet walk, film screening along with a presentation and discussion by the filmmaker.  All proceeds from the event will benefit education and the fight against Antisemitism.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to be hosting this charity event and presenting the Illinois film premiere of The Walk,\u201d said Producer Adam Fried. \u201cThis film is a powerful reminder of the importance of fighting against intolerance. We hope that this event will raise awareness of the need to continue the fight against Antisemitism in today\u2019s current climate.<\/p>\n<p>The Walk was produced and written by Adam Fried and directed by Jonny Stern. The film has been praised for its powerful storytelling and its ability to shed light on a little-known part of Holocaust history. The film had its World Premiere at the Soho International Film Festival in New York on September 18th. The Walk has won awards at 3 film festivals and will be shown this fall at the Santa Barbara Jewish Film Festival and the Austin Jewish Film Festival. Tickets for the event are $36 and can be purchased online.<\/p>\n<p>About: The Visual History Initiative uses film to educate and fight against Antisemitism.
