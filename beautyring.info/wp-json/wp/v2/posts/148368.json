It clings to every tree, covering it so thoroughly that it prevents sunlight from reaching its host\u2014and slowly starving the underlying tree of nutrients.<\/p>\n<p>Worse, kudzu is just one of many invasive species that can kill trees and other native plant life; other species like privet, English ivy, and Japanese honeysuckle also contribute to the problem. That\u2019s why, throughout Virginia and surrounding areas, organizations and programs have been established to confront this issue. In Fairfax County; Washington, DC; Richmond; and elsewhere, groups like the Invasive Management Area Volunteer Program, the Rock Creek Weed Warriors, and the James River Park System Invasive Plant Task Force offer opportunities for volunteers to help rid their communities of these harmful species. And now, Virginia author Leslie Eva Tayloe has written a children\u2019s book to teach families about this important topic\u2014and maybe prompt them to join one of the volunteer opportunities in their area.<\/p>\n<p>The book\u2014now also a Junior Library Guild selection\u2014features Ronnie, a precocious kid who is determined to save his town\u2019s trees from invasive vines. But he can\u2019t do it alone! When he and his best friend Leona learn that the non-native plants are slowly creeping over and suffocating the local trees, the pair quickly get to work tearing them down. <\/p>\n<p>Still, pulling down vines and uprooting weeds is tiring work for anyone, much less two kids still in elementary school. So, the pair come up with a plan to recruit others to help them accomplish the daunting task of clearing the vines from the trees\u2014and, when that group of volunteers gets tired too, yet another plan! Over the course of one extraordinary summer, Ronnie and Leona will combat not only invasive vines, but their own community\u2019s exhaustion and ennui. And in the process, they\u2019ll convince everyone there\u2019s only one way to save the trees: together! <\/p>\n<p>Showcasing the power of persistence, and featuring vibrant illustrations to inspire kids and parents alike to save the trees in their own communities, &#8216;Save the Trees&#8217; is scheduled for release on April 11, 2024.<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Ronnie loves trees. So when strange vines appear all over town, strangling the trees and making them fall over, he jumps into action right away! But Ronnie\u2019s just one kid, and even with friends and family helping to pick, pull, and pluck the vines, they just grow faster every day! If he really wants to save the trees, Ronnie will have to get the whole town to help out . . . before it\u2019s too late!&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;About the Author&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Leslie Eva Tayloe holds a master\u2019s degree in human resource management from the University of Maryland.
