Overall, globally, properties running a TravelAds campaign see 90% more visibility and 120% more bookings versus non-enrolled properties.<sup>1<\/sup> Company data shows hotels and airlines saw significant boosts in bookings and revenue during major events last year when enlisting the help of these tools. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Looking specifically at major cultural events in 2023:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><i>The ball is in your court: <\/i>Hotels using TravelAds in the surrounding area of <span class=\"xn-location\">Wimbledon<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">London<\/span>, saw an average boost in revenue of almost 30% last summer,<sup>2<\/sup> an event that draws thousands of spectators each year. Imperial London Hotels used TravelAds to drive demand, resulting in almost 30% of their total Expedia-booked room nights during the tournament coming from the sponsored listing tool.<sup>3<\/sup><\/li>\n<li><i>Capturing Tay Tay hysteria:<\/i> <span class=\"xn-person\">Taylor Swift<\/span> mania has swept the globe, with local markets seeing a significant boost in their economies from her &#8220;Eras&#8221; Tour, including her homecoming stop in <span class=\"xn-location\">Nashville<\/span> in <span class=\"xn-chron\">May 2023<\/span>. To capture travelers&#8217; attention during this highly competitive moment, <span class=\"xn-location\">Nashville<\/span> hotels that ran TravelAds campaigns for stays during her <span class=\"xn-location\">Nashville<\/span> concert saw an average boost of 5% in both revenue and bookings<sup>4<\/sup><\/li>\n<li><i>Racing to glory:<\/i> When fans of Formula 1 traveled to <span class=\"xn-location\">Las Vegas<\/span>, a U.S.-based regional airline saw an opportunity to promote its <span class=\"xn-location\">Dallas<\/span> to <span class=\"xn-location\">Las Vegas<\/span> route via Flight Sponsored Listings to help harness Texan demand. The advertising tool drove almost a 30% increase in revenue<sup>5<\/sup> and contributed to just over 20% of bookings for flights between <span class=\"xn-chron\">November 15-19, 2023<\/span>.<\/li>\n<li><i>Helping hotel partners score a touchdown: <\/i>During the 2023 Super Bowl, hotels using TravelAds in <span class=\"xn-location\">Phoenix<\/span> saw an average boost in revenue of just over 15% over the weekend.<sup>6<\/sup> This year, hotels in <span class=\"xn-location\">Las Vegas<\/span> saw an average 5% boost in revenue during Super Bowl 2024 when enrolled in TravelAds over that weekend.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The tools can also be leveraged seasonally to boost airline partners&#8217; visibility and to capture important seasonal moments. Etihad Airways helped American tourists expand their horizons outside of their typical winter escapes to locations farther from home in both <span class=\"xn-location\">Abu Dhabi<\/span> and the <span class=\"xn-location\">Maldives<\/span>. Using Flight Sponsored Listings, Etihad saw bookings from the U.S. to both destination airports increase by almost 5%, totaling just over a 30% boost in gross bookings.<sup>7<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been offering our hotel partners the ability to boost their visibility on our sites for over 15 years with our industry-leading TravelAds tool and are now offering our airline partners the same with Flight Sponsored Listings. There is no doubt this latest data confirms the effectiveness of these advertising tools in helping our partners shine in the most competitive of moments throughout the year,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Jennifer Andre<\/span>, VP of Business Development at Expedia Group Media Solutions. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to continue working with our partners during 2024&#8217;s biggest cultural moments \u2014 from the Paris Olympics to major world music tours \u2014 to offer them our full suite of advertising options and to elevate their listing when they need it the most.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;Tour Tourism&#8217; is set to continue into 2024. According to a recent Expedia survey, over 40% said they&#8217;d travel for a concert as an excuse to visit a new place.<sup>7<\/sup> When <span class=\"xn-person\">Taylor Swift&#8217;s<\/span> 2024 Eras Tour schedule was announced for <span class=\"xn-location\">Asia<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Australia<\/span>, travel searches increased by over 250% year-over-year for the corresponding tour cities.<sup>8<\/sup>\u00a0Similarly, when the 2024 European tour dates were announced, travel searches for May to <span class=\"xn-chron\">August 2024<\/span> increased by nearly 65% for cities with corresponding tour stops.<sup>9<\/sup>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Advertising partners can maximize their use of these tools to ensure they&#8217;re capturing demand when it makes the most sense for their business:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><b>Target specific groups to reach specific goals: <\/b>TravelAds targeting is based on real-time travel intent and demand data, helping partners identify the most valuable travelers for their hotel.
