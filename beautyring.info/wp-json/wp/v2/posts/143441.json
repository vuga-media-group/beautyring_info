It is estimated to reach USD 18.3 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 8.0% during the forecast period (2023\u20132031).<\/i><\/b><b><i>\u201d<\/i><\/b> More than 25 million farmers produce coffee in more than 50 nations. Organic coffee&#8217;s demand is driven by the numerous health benefits it offers. For instance, it is rich in polyphenol antioxidants such as flavonoids and catechins. Stabilizing the harmful free radicals in the human body prevents extensive cellular deterioration. In addition, research has demonstrated that coffee consumption aids in weight loss, reduces cholesterol levels, boosts immunity, and protects against neurological diseases. Also, people consider cold coffee, caf\u00e9 lattes, and cappuccinos, among other coffee-related beverages, refreshing. Further, the rising trend of coffee consumption outside the home augurs a rise in coffee consumption in the following years. Therefore, this increase is projected to stimulate the global market for organic coffee.<\/p>\n<p><b>New Growth Avenues provided by Digital Marketing Creates Tremendous Opportunities <\/b><\/p>\n<p>Media such as the Internet, television, and newspapers assist in learning about the advantages of organic foods, such as coffee. In 2015, according to an analysis by Straits Research, more than 70 percent of Americans routinely utilized social media. A growing percentage of active users hear about organic coffee through social media and are more willing to try it. Since organic coffee is produced without chemicals or pesticides, it has fewer negative side effects. Hence, a greater understanding of social media and fewer negative effects of coffee give a new chance for industry players to market, promote, and expand their presence.<\/p>\n<p><b>Regional Analysis<\/b><\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=9_nY40nvZ-WAfgLgu4VTzvJ7lZNCgGy4LoL3PH0HsvnnDKWPgi7CkvcSjVS_IyqCW8DTyvv7tcQwalN0Yex_4odTw4tV0CD4AR0XSShq2V0-ooEUFVNihCp45zdtajrChA7_YHCwevRUsd9HJVj-F7DdpyNQtWQCY94vKzxVRdE=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>North America organic coffee market share<\/u><\/a> is anticipated to exhibit a CAGR of 7.0% during the forecast period.
