In addition, the expanding focus that the government is placing on discovering efficient energy solutions in terms of cost will further boost market growth.<\/h2>\n<p>New York, United States, Dec.  19, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &#8212; Wind turbines are machines that convert the wind&#8217;s kinetic energy into electricity. A floating wind turbine is a submerged offshore wind turbine supported by a floating base. The wind turbine can generate electricity in water depths where a fixed foundation would be inapplicable because it is mounted on a structure. Multiple mooring cables and anchors secure the turbine to the ocean floor. Any body of water with a depth of 60 meters or more is suitable for a floating wind turbine. Furthermore, floating wind turbines can generate electricity consistently, unlike onshore wind turbines, due to the constant wind flow along the shore.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Download Free Sample Report PDF @<\/strong>\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=IwfJuqnPRA4TCa8AR7pRfDPRHCyqV_nctuml04B0T7jrLDu2dw0YoRQ5f4ieSANxH6I_yuTWKcRHxmeZpNFir16gl3M7mDO1OI0IHgAEHV22ZBRCArr70wpYDwPdVGA-5SlTg5GE8c7OSSVksgvTKmFu8n7VJWaikQwcjuhPMaXK07HmdHrhnSfvLnh1GhtM84D6TYad4a5t9r2fPfxzhf9Qs0hHAMyPs7T0et1yTvE5g5awny3XW9CS3-r27vg1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b><u>https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/floating-wind-turbine-market\/request-sample<\/u><\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The growth of the market for floating wind turbines is anticipated to be driven by the substantial increase in demand for renewable energy sources. Unlike conventional energy sources, floating wind turbines reduce carbon emissions and are cost-effective. In addition, floating wind turbines&#8217; technology eliminates water depth restriction, making it easier to select the optimal location for power generation. Additionally, the capacity factor of floating wind turbines exceeds that of land-based wind turbines. This is a result of the constant energy output of floating wind turbines. However, installing a wind turbine with multiple mooring lines and anchors can be expensive. In addition, the wind turbine may sustain significant damage during intense storms and hurricanes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Rise in Demand for Renewable Power Sources and Electricity Consumption to Drive the Global Floating Wind Turbine Market<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>According to Straits Research, &#8220;The global floating wind turbine market size was valued at\u00a0USD 5,655 million in 2021, projected to reach\u00a0USD 54,704 million,\u00a0and expand at a\u00a0CAGR of 32.8%\u00a0during the forecast period.&#8221; The substantial increase in demand for renewable energy sources is anticipated to propel the growth of the floating wind turbine market.
