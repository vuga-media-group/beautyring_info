For example, the Union is falsely claiming that the Coordinated Bargaining Group&#8217;s proposal may not secure employees&#8217; health care for the next four years.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It is not surprising the Union is refusing to provide any proof to back up its health care statements and demands as well as information regarding its other proposals,&#8221; Grossman said. &#8220;The documentation we have requested would show that the Union&#8217;s public claims are simply incorrect. Our proposal ensures that the employees&#8217; Health Care Fund will be able to provide quality affordable health care coverage to employees and their families for the next four years.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The information we are seeking from Local 11 is obviously important and necessary to the bargaining, and it is unfortunate that the Union is more focused on strikes and its political agenda than on bargaining in good faith.&#8221;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Contact: <br class=\"dnr\">Keith\u00a0Grossman<br class=\"dnr\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection#541f13263b272739353a143c3f313924383b2d39313a203835237a373b39\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"1e55596c716d6d737f705e76757b736e727167737b706a727f69307d7173\">[email\u00a0protected]<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p>SOURCE Coordinated Bargaining Group<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/rt.prnewswire.com\/rt.gif?NewsItemId=SF51226&amp;Transmission_Id=202307061416PR_NEWS_USPR_____SF51226&amp;DateId=20230706\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Originally published at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/la-hotels-file-unfair-labor-charges-against-unite-here-local-11-301871468.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer sponsored\">https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/la-hotels-file-unfair-labor-charges-against-unite-here-local-11-301871468.html<\/a><br \/>\n<font size=\"-1\"><em>Images courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/pixabay.com<\/a><\/em><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>LOS ANGELES, July 6, 2023 \/PRNewswire\/ &#8212; The Coordinated Bargaining Group, which represents 44 Los Angeles and Orange County-area hotels negotiating with UNITE HERE, Local 11, has filed Unfair Labor Practice Charges against the Union with the National Labor Relations Board.
