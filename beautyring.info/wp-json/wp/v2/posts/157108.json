I realize that what I recall might be no truer that what I imagine. This book plays with the haze between memory and make believe. I can\u2019t even tell where the facts of my life end and my perceptions of those facts distort them to the level of fiction. With this book, I stopped pretending I could tell the difference. It\u2019s part truth, part twisted truth, part complete fancy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A Memory of Fictions (or) Just Tiddy-Boom&#8221; also provides a unique focus on New Orleans\u2019 black Creole culture and the black, striver middle-class of the 1960s. \u201cNew Orleans Creoles were a wild bunch,\u201d Gaiter laughs. \u201cThey comported themselves\u2014and insisted their children comport themselves\u2014like semi-royalty. When they spawned Strivers like my parents, the results could be a relentless pursuit of the impossible goal of proving themselves unassailable to racist white eyes\u2014the epitome of \u2018respectability politics,\u2019 which took a toll.\u201d  <\/p>\n<p>The book has earned critical praise. Blue Ink Review stated, \u201cGaiter\u2019s wonderfully evocative language, filled with musicality, captures the complexity of Jessie\u2019s emotions as he struggles to make sense of his\u2026 place in the world.\u201d IndieReader called it, \u201c\u2026a bold novel. Sometimes beautiful, sometimes brutal, the prose is always thoroughly engrossing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gaiter is thrilled that the book\u2019s sometimes tragic, often hilarious look at race, sex, and growing up is appealing to readers. \u201cI think Jessie\u2019s journey is everyone\u2019s,\u201d he says. \u201cWe all want to throw off the shackles and be ourselves, regardless of what \u2018the rules\u2019 tell us we ought to be.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Author information: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.leoncegaiter.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.leoncegaiter.com\/<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFor review copies or interview requests, please contact info@buckrampage.com<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.leoncegaiter.com\/Press\/index.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Press information<\/a>: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.leoncegaiter.com\/Press\/index.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.leoncegaiter.com\/Press\/index.html<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Leonce Gaiter<br \/>info@buckrampage.com<br \/>Legba Books<br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/x.com\/leonceg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">X<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4CxtSrcSliY&amp;t=7s\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Book trailer for &#8220;A Memory of Fictions (or) Just Tiddy-Boom<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"4CxtSrcSliY\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"A Memory of Fictions\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/4CxtSrcSliY?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=XzR-4yQ7NSsvzNR6&amp;i=ZK5qAQ9tNNrKUoEK\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      July 31, 2024, 10:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/731698244\/a-stunning-look-at-growing-up-gay-in-the-striving-black-middle-class-of-the-60s-and-70s\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
