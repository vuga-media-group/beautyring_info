The observance, held annually in May, is a critical time to educate the public about Lyme disease prevention and treatment as the weather warms and people increasingly spend time outdoors, potentially exposing themselves to tick bites.<\/p>\n<p>About the LivLyme Foundation:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe LivLyme Foundation, founded by Olivia Goodreau, aims to eradicate Lyme and other tick-borne diseases through funding, treatment and research, as well as promoting tick education and awareness globally. Learn more at LivLymeFoundation.org.<\/p>\n<p>About Lyme disease:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nLyme disease is most often transmitted by tick bites and has been found in all 50 states and in more than 60 countries. Public awareness of its symptoms and possible contraction is critical. The CDC estimates that more than 476,000+ Americans are diagnosed with Lyme disease every year. This is 1.5 times greater than the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer annually, and seven times the number of people diagnosed with HIV\/AIDS annually.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But She Looks Fine: From Illness to Activism&#8221; is available for purchase via Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble.
