I look nothing like that &#8230; Addicts are everywhere, and we look just like you. \u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Author Lori Lynne Armstrong <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, July 29, 2024 \/<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/\" dir=\"auto\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">EINPresswire.com<\/a>\/ &#8212; Lori Lynne Armstrong had a plan: be beautiful, brilliant and successful enough to escape her inexplicable feelings of worthlessness. An eating disorder, chronic pain, hospitalization for mental illness and an addiction to painkillers were NOT part of that plan. She fought for decades before realizing it was time for a new approach.<\/p>\n<p>In her compelling new memoir, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Someday-Will-Not-Be-Ashamed\/dp\/B0C5PJR6TN\/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.A3KQOYTb7WWI_xB_4XxGxg.gi0vEEuS8-LuqAcjXJZSOaIgb6LG-Tu_Bndu_cJahAw&amp;qid=1722271785&amp;sr=8-1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Someday I Will Not Be Ashamed<\/a>, Armstrong chases her goal of perfection with one scheme after another, using beauty, sex, academic achievement, professional merit and motherhood as ways to feel acceptable. <\/p>\n<p>Someday I Will Not Be Ashamed lets readers follow a woman from the corridors of M.I.T. to the hallways of the psychiatric ward, from therapist-in-training to a therapist\u2019s problem patient, and, at last, beyond shame to an unlikely self-acceptance. <\/p>\n<p>Drawing upon her educational background in psychology and molecular biology to observe every step of her journey through an informed lens, Armstrong\u2019s approach is emotionally authentic and avoids painting a perfect picture of recovery. The author doesn\u2019t overcome her conditions, except in the basic sense of staying off of the drugs that were killing her. She has to learn to live with them and build a life that fits her very real limitations. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is not a success story,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cOh, there are successes in it. A few, or many, depending on your point of view. But this isn\u2019t \u2018inspiration porn.\u2019 This isn\u2019t a book telling you that you can overcome anything and be whatever you want to be. This book has something to say for anyone who needs to craft a life that fits their abilities instead of one that fits society\u2019s pressures.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A revealing look at the perils of toxic perfectionism, Someday I Will Not Be Ashamed offers a lifeline to anyone struggling with self-acceptance and humanizes the face of substance abuse and mental illness.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMany people have conscious or unconscious ideas of how a junkie looks or talks. I look nothing like that, and I talk like the love child of a poet and a psychologist,\u201d Armstrong added. \u201cAddicts are everywhere, and we look just like you. And we who live with mental illness are everywhere, too. Anyone you meet who looks confident on the outside may be battling symptoms or drowning in a swamp of shame.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<br \/>Lori Lynne Armstrong has been a scientist, a counselor, a mental patient and a drug addict.
