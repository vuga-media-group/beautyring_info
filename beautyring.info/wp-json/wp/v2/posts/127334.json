This year\u2019s winners for the categories include World Cleanup Day, Stefano Boeri Architetti\u2019s Green Obsession, and the International Rescue Committee\u2019s Signpost initiative. In addition, IFAD Goodwill Ambassadors Idris Elba and Sabrina Dhowre Elba received Honourable Mention for their work in propelling the role smallholder farmers play in global agriculture into the media spotlight.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe 2023 UN SDG Action Awards come as we approach the midpoint of Agenda 2030 \u2013 a critical crossroads in our journey towards a more sustainable, equitable, and inclusive future for all,\u201d said Marina Ponti, Global Director of the UN SDG Action Campaign. \u201cMost importantly, they offer us an opportunity to honour and recognize the extraordinary individuals who are inspiring change and driving meaningful action for the SDGs.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The 2023 edition of the Awards received over 5,000 high quality applications from 190 countries covering the full breadth of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The Winner for the MOBILIZE category, World Cleanup Day, is celebrated for its work in coordinating global one-day waste cleanups that have rallied over 70 million people from more than 190 countries. Green Obsession, the winner in the INSPIRE category, is acknowledged for its work changing city paradigms and emphasizing urban forests as a priority for governments around the world, ensuring a greener future for all. The International Rescue Committee\u2019s Signpost initiative took top prize in the CONNECT category for being the world\u2019s first scalable approach to running digital, community-driven, and responsive information platforms in countries where people are impacted by conflict, disasters, poverty, and violence. And in the CHANGEMAKER category Nery Santaella won for her Voices of Venezuela \u2013 a migrants-helping-migrants model that has helped over 600,000 individuals.<\/p>\n<p>Along with the Winners, this year\u2019s Finalists also included an inspiring array of individuals and organizations such as ImpactHER, an Africa-based initiative that has mobilized and trained over 7.5 million women entrepreneurs across 53 African countries to unlock their economic potential and fight poverty; Buenos Aires Climate Action, which aims to inspire and engage citizens of Buenos Aires in climate action with the vision of becoming a carbon neutral, resilient, and inclusive city by 2050; Youth Parliament, a Brazilian effort that empowers youth for civic life and democratic engagement; and Nazir Atul and Emmanuel Mushy, who were nominated for VAS Hub, a collaborative project that aims to reduce youth unemployment and engagement in informal\/unproductive sectors.   <\/p>\n<p>The 2023 Winners now join an illustrious set of UN SDG Action Awards alumni and will ally with the UN SDG Action Campaign for the 2023 Global Week during which more than 150 million people will be mobilized around the world to drive action for the SDGs.      <\/p>\n<p>\u201cToday, we saw initiatives and individuals that are mobilizing, inspiring, and connecting people each day,\u201d Antonio Tajani, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Government of Italy, said in his closing remarks at the Awards Ceremony. \u201cI wish to congratulate you for your efforts and commitment to accelerate progress toward the SDGs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am very pleased to have joined you today and see how many of you offer proof of the possibilities,\u201d Mr. Tajani added.   <\/p>\n<p>The UN SDG Action Campaign is a special initiative of the UN Secretary-General hosted by the Executive Office of the UN Development Programme (UNDP). It was established to unite people from across the world to take action for the SDGs and to connect civil society, local governments, and people working in the arts and culture, media, and private sectors in championing the SDGs in homes, communities and beyond. In that role, the Campaign is mandated to MOBILIZE, INSPIRE, AND CONNECT people and organizations from all sectors and geographies to take actions to achieve the SDGs, including through the annual UN SDG Action Awards. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt the UN SDG Action Campaign, we are proud to host an event that brings people together to celebrate, inspire, and be inspired \u2014 and to unite for change,\u201d continued Ms. Ponti. \u201cBecause the world needs unity and change now more than ever if we are to achieve Agenda 2030. And it needs the remarkable creativity that all Awards finalists have brought here today.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Andrew Zaganelli Giacalone<br \/>UN SDG Action Campaign<br \/>+49 1626570109<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/646143852\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SDGaction\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SDGaction\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/sdg-action-campaign\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sdgaction\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=e9NJdHvt-j-rnL7j&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      July 24, 2023, 19:58 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/646143852\/global-sustainability-leaders-take-top-prize-at-united-nations-sdg-action-awards\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"channels\" dir=\"auto\">\n        Distribution channels:<br \/>\n        <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/agriculture-farming-forestry\" title=\"Agriculture, Farming &amp; Forestry Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Agriculture, Farming &amp; Forestry Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/business-economy\" title=\"Business &amp; Economy Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Business &amp; Economy<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/culture-society-lifestyle\" title=\"Culture, Society &amp; Lifestyle Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Culture, Society &amp; Lifestyle<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/human-rights\" title=\"Human Rights Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Human Rights<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/international-organizations\" title=\"International Organizations Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">International Organizations<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/media-advertising-pr\" title=\"Media, Advertising &amp; PR Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Media, Advertising &amp; PR<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/movies\" title=\"Movie Industry Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Movie Industry<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/social_media\" title=\"Social Media Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Social Media<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/uspolitics\" title=\"U.S. Politics Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">U.S. Politics<\/a>, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/channel\/world-regional\" title=\"World &amp; Regional Press Releases\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">World &amp; Regional<\/a><br \/>\n        &#8230;\n      <\/div>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
