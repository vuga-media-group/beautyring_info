This city in east China&#8217;s Zhejiang Province now stands as the country&#8217;s focal point for e-commerce business. Meanwhile, Seattle, the largest city in the state of Washington, gave rise to the world&#8217;s first Starbucks and such tech giants as Microsoft and Amazon. It earned the nicknameof the &#8220;Emerald City&#8221; for its lush greenery.<\/p>\n<p>In Tian&#8217;s eyes, Seattle and Hangzhou share many similarities. She notes, &#8220;Hangzhou is a city at the vanguard of culture, technology and the internet sector. Habitable and endowed with a superb ecology, the cities of Seattle and Hangzhou are notable hubs of enterprise and initiative.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>After an in-depth exploration of Hangzhou, Tian Jiaxin decides to adapt the melody from Yue Opera classic &#8220;The Butterfly Lovers&#8221; as the main theme, incorporating segments of &#8220;Xiyang Xiaogu&#8221; (Music at Sunset). As a pianist, Tian constantly experiments with reproducing the sounds of various traditional Chinese instruments on the piano. The accelerating rhythm in the latter part of the piece showcases the fast-paced advancements in technology and the rapid development of Hangzhou.<\/p>\n<p>To find the music and sounds that best embody the spirit of Seattle, Li Yuqi visits the Pike Place Market located in the city&#8217;s downtown. To Li, this farmers&#8217; market provides her with endless inspiration. She remarks, &#8220;It gives you a lot of possibilities to explore Seattle&#8217;s culture and vibe, through food, drinks, music, local business and people.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The music that can best represent the city of Seattle is the type of music that can create big musical contrasts, but still keep a good balance,&#8221; Li adds. She adapts Beethoven&#8217;s &#8220;Violin Sonata No. 8 in G major&#8221; as the theme of the city to illustrate Seattle&#8217;s diversity.<\/p>\n<p>When Hangzhou meets Seattle\u2026 pianist Tian Jiaxin and violinist Li Yuqi embark on a musical journey across the Pacific.
