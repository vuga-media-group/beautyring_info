Weissman\u2019s new book party and signing is the evening before.<\/p>\n<p>The treaty was successful in lowering polar bear deaths from big issues of the time\u2014trophy hunting, shootings from airplanes and elsewhere, shootings when polar bears were near towns or people.<\/p>\n<p>Now the bigger threat to polar bears: Faster warming of Arctic and subarctic than elsewhere. Sea ice forms later and melts earlier. And sea ice is where polar bears live. This forces polar bears to live near people.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI personally SAW polar bears that had not eaten for 145 days\u2014no sea ice as the climate warms,\u201d reports author Rozanne Weissman who traveled to Churchill, Manitoba, Canada for this book. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cPolar bears curiously walked around our Polar Rover. Then we went to the Hudson Bay to watch polar bears test the ice\u2014jumping, lying spread eagle with butt up\u2014to see if the ice were strong enough to hold them. It wasn\u2019t yet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Why should humans care? Arctic sea ice is important for humans. It reflects sunlight and keeps worldwide temperatures down. It\u2019s the earth\u2019s \u201cair <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nconditioner.\u201c<\/p>\n<p>Rozanne\u2019s two children \u201cbook consultants\u201d ensure that the book is written for children 2-8. Before the trip, they encouraged a now popular book section on \u201cSurprising  Polar Bear Facts.\u201d See six expert outside book reviews by wildlife, climate, and two by early childhood educators. The book also includes dogsledding with wonderful photos and videos of dogs; also photos\/videos of   helicoptering to a polar bear den.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRozanne Tracks Polar Bears at Edge of Arctic,\u201d is the author\u2019s second book created in her unique style in the children\u2019s book world:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 REAL story rather than fantastical (child loves wildlife, grows up, travels where wildlife live\u2014in the wild)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 REAL photos vs illustrations <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 Emojis\u2014children wanted more<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 Rozanne\u2019s Wildlife Travels YouTube channel (Subscribe FREE!) accompanies 2 books<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022 Beyond book\u2014Rozanne taps the creativity and imagination of children.
