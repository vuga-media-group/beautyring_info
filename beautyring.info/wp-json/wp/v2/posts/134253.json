It also eliminates the need for them to create backups, purchase costly servers, or become an expert in managing their computer equipment.<\/p>\n<p>Continuous technological improvements in the industry, favourable government initiatives in the oral healthcare industry, and an increase in the number of dental practises all contribute to market growth. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITEC) Act promotes and hastens the adoption of health information technology in the United States. The HITEC Act was enacted to enhance the delivery of healthcare and provide patients with high-quality services.<\/p>\n<p><b>Get a Free Sample Copy of This Report @ <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=0X7AbjCDE1e71-ugnW1t7A3nmeDWDPuYN-Ge4VqYWGsch_EBMjJMzCsOpKuhspD0m23ZWCWilxSLbm0574oxBwJS5md1N8TKuLvem69cy3ResBP6H_UH3NhWi-RB_5c7hPJWVbswJ8spFM7C0a4pemFDR-nWf8VMskxgjGKmBlzKTSUOSDGP2bIeMlO7DEM_ibBH1FAJemCBZa9uwv03m2ZpLvO-r7sEo57sm9RWo3No7bA6F9wuv1y56qxmJxzE5l8mcdF99Q9Q7bYEnvUJdomyFw6yEtUjE0YlxtPNfCqdiGgt9IV7mScM7cadu5bA\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/cloud-based-dental-practice-management-software-market\/request-sample<\/u><\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Growth Opportunities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The adoption of the HITECH Act in the United States and other nations has had an impact on the healthcare delivery system and the installation of electronic health records. Medical personnel who refused to use electronic health records were punished. In addition, the expanding geriatric population in a number of nations is stimulating the market for dental practise management software.<\/p>\n<p>The development of multiple modules in cloud-based dental practise management software is accelerating the industry expansion. Practice management software, patient communication software solutions, treatment planning software, patient education software, dental imaging software, and orthodontic modelling software have been increasingly utilised by medical professionals in recent years as a result of a reduction in the number of healthcare facility employees. <\/p>\n<p><b>Growing awareness &amp; increase in patient visit<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The rise in the number of patients attending dentists has made appointment scheduling and patient data administration more challenging for dentists, necessitating the use of modern DPM software such as Dentrix Ascend, Tab32, and others. In the last few years, there has been an increase in oral health awareness, which has led to an increase in the number of precautionary dental visits every six months in most nations. Increasing awareness and a rise in patient visits are two of the primary aspects that will create development prospects for the market during the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p><b>Regional Analysis <\/b><\/p>\n<p>The market is split by region into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and LAMEA.<\/p>\n<p>In 2021, North America held 47.6% of the market. Baby boomers&#8217; quick adoption of dental care services is a critical element in the U.S. market&#8217;s growth.<\/p>\n<p>Increasing start-up funding may also boost market growth. Delta Dental of California, SteadView Capital, Accel Partners, F-Prime Capital, and Eight Roads gave CareStack $22.5 million in April 2021. The same investor gave the company $28 million in 2019. Such huge investments in start-ups should fuel the regional market.<\/p>\n<p>Asia Pacific is expected to grow rapidly. Growing investments by healthcare IT businesses in the region, better economic conditions, and healthcare structure boost the market. China is expected to rise significantly. Increasing senior population, spending on oral care, and acceptance of new technologies are to blame.<\/p>\n<p><b>Key Highlights<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/cloud-based-dental-practice-management-software-market\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>global cloud-based dental practice management market size<\/u><\/a> is projected to reach USD 1,473.09 million by 2030, registering a CAGR of 11.09% from 2022 to 2030.<\/li>\n<li>The patient communication software segment is estimated to dominate the market with a share of 33.4% in 2020.<\/li>\n<li>The billing and insurance segment is anticipated to witness the maximum compound annual growth rate during the forecast period.<\/li>\n<li>North America held the largest share of the market in 2021<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Competitive players <\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dentiflow<\/li>\n<li>Dentidesk<\/li>\n<li>Cd Nevco, LLC (Curve Dental)<\/li>\n<li>Tab32<\/li>\n<li>Henry Schein One<\/li>\n<li>Planet DDS<\/li>\n<li>Carestack<\/li>\n<li>Carestream Dental LLC<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Recent Developments by key players<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In February 2022, Carestream Dental&#8217;s Software-as-a-Service, Sensei Cloud, is introducing new capabilities that may enable dentists to expand their operations and provide better patient care.
