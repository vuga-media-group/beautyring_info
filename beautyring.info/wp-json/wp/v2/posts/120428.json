With the uncertainty around travel plans, consumers were more inclined to purchase on-demand travel insurance, which offered more flexibility compared to traditional travel insurance products. However, the electronic equipment insurance segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 15.4% from 2023 to 2032, due to the increasing adoption of electronic devices, especially in emerging markets. The rise in the number of smartphone and other electronic device users has led to an increase in demand for on-demand electronic equipment insurance, which provides protection against accidental damage, theft, and loss of electronic devices. This segment is expected to grow rapidly due to the rising consumer need for protection of their valuable electronic devices.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The individuals segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period<\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Based on end user, the individuals segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the global on-demand insurance market revenue, and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period, due to the growing trend of individuals seeking personalized insurance solutions that cater to their specific needs. With on-demand insurance, individuals can customize their coverage, pay only for what they need, and have the flexibility to adjust their coverage as needed. This has led to an increase in demand for on-demand insurance among individuals. However, the businesses segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 14.4% from 2022 to 2032, due to the rising adoption of on-demand insurance among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). On-demand insurance provides SMEs with the ability to quickly and easily obtain insurance coverage for specific risks, without the need for lengthy underwriting processes or annual contracts. This segment is expected to grow rapidly due to the increasing number of SMEs and their need for flexible and affordable insurance solutions. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>North America to maintain its dominance by 2032<\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Based on region, North America held the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2022, accounting for more than one-third of the global on-demand insurance market revenue, due to the region&#8217;s high adoption of technology and the presence of major on-demand insurance providers. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic increased the demand for on-demand insurance in the region, especially for health and travel coverage. However, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness the fastest CAGR of 15.4% from 2023 to 2032, and is likely to dominate the market during the forecast period, due to the region&#8217;s increasing adoption of on-demand insurance and the rise of tech-savvy consumers. The region has a large population of millennials and Gen Z consumers who prefer personalized insurance solutions and are more likely to use digital platforms to purchase insurance. The rising adoption of smartphones and other digital devices in the region is also driving the demand for on-demand insurance, making it a high-growth market for on-demand insurance providers.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Leading Market Players: &#8211;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0AXA<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chubb<br \/>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GetSafe<br \/>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Metromile<br \/>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Munich Re<br \/>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ping An Insurance<br \/>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Root<br \/>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Zurich<br \/>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Zego<br \/>\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Zuno<br \/>The report provides a detailed analysis of these key players of the global on-demand insurance market.
