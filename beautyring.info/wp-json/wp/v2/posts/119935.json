I never saw myself as a beauty standard since I never saw that in mainstream media.  I never saw other Asian women go out there and do their own thing, which was to forge their own path.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Negative stereotypes and low expectations continue to impact Asian women who aspire to lead. According to a recent survey completed in 2021, only 2.7% of Asian women in the United States occupied managerial or executive roles.  Sheena realizes that the cultural and historical issues affect the leadership potential of people generally, and Asian women specifically. <\/p>\n<p>This is why she is launching her upcoming book with Wiley, entitled The Tao Of Self-Confidence: A Guide to Moving Beyond Trauma and Awakening the Leader Within.  This book is an essential and timely guide for early- and mid-career professionals ready to realize their full potential and will also earn a place in the libraries of all Asian women who are tired of repeating past patterns and ready to conquer the obstacles that have been holding them back.<\/p>\n<p>Sheena hopes the book will help Asian women in particular recognize their own worth. \u201cI want Asian women to realize their potential, that they are leaders in their own right when they can learn to heal from the traumas that hold them back from their greatness.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In honor of AAPI Heritage Month and Mental Health Awareness Month which is happening this month, Sheena is also fundraising for a Library Donation Drive so that she can donate 3,000 copies of her upcoming book to libraries across the United States.

The book will be on launching May 23rd, 2023.<\/p>\n<p>About The Tao of Self-Confidence: A Guide to Moving Beyond Trauma and Awakening the Leader Within<\/p>\n<p>In 2021, women represented 54.3% of the US workforce but only held 35% of senior leadership positions. Of that percentage, only 2.7% of Asian women were seen in management roles. While there have been great leaps for women in the workplace in the last decade, women of color still fall behind. The Tao of Self-Confidence book sets a foundation to help Asian Women start being seen as leaders in work and life rather than by our stereotypes. In order to move forward with true confidence, we must learn the lessons our challenges have taught us and heal our trauma.<\/p>\n<p>With an honest and vulnerable approach, Yap Chan discusses and explores the specific challenges our community faces, historically and now in the midst of the pandemic, intergenerational and historical trauma, false stories we tell ourselves, and how we can rise above stereotypes. We\u2019ll tap into our inner joy, celebrate our authentic self, and awaken the leader within.<\/p>\n<p>About Sheena Yap Chan<\/p>\n<p>Sheena Yap Chan is a keynote speaker, podcaster, consultant, and author on building self-confidence.
