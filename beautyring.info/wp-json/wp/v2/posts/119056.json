Snail slime is used to make snail beauty items. External mucous that a snail secretes through its body is known as snail slime. Hyaluronic acid, glycolic acid, and elastin are antioxidants found in snail mucin that improve appearance of wrinkles, dark spots, acne, rosacea, and other skin conditions. Customers can easily find snail slime-based face creams, face masks, anti-aging creams, serums, moisturizers, and toners on online and offline distribution channels. In addition, owing to rise in knowledge of advantages of using snail-based personal and beauty care products, snail beauty products are becoming increasingly popular in developed economies such as North America and Europe.<\/p>\n<p>Various micro and macro factors contribute toward growth of the snail beauty products industry such as rise in disposable income, increase in millennial population who are targeted consumer base for most of personal and beauty care products, and growth in area under snail farming. For instance, per capita disposable income in emerging economies has increased considerably over past few years. The per capita income of emerging economies, such as China, increased by 8.0% from 2020 to 2021. While India&#8217;s disposable personal income increased by around 12.3% in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Request The Sample PDF Of This Report :- <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/request-sample\/17251\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/request-sample\/17251<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Growth in popularity for vegan and organic cosmetics and high market hold of natural and chemical amalgamated beauty care products are major restraining factors for growth of the market.
