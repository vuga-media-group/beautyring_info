Until December 2023 the 1989 Film Kickboxer starring Jean-Claude Van Damme was listed as World&#8217;s 1st Kickboxing Film.<\/p>\n<p>Memphis, Tennessee is  the city that has the largest Black population in America.   Anthony &#8220;Amp&#8221; Elmore a Black Memphis born five time World Kickboxing Champion is fighting Memphis Black elected officials to get his film history and Black history honored, taught and acknowledged in Memphis.   <\/p>\n<p>On Friday September 16, 2021 Elmore wrote an open letter to both former White Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and current African\/American Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris.  Elmore appealed to the &#8220;Moral Consciousness&#8221; of the Mayors and the City and County.  <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H61tIDEdot0&amp;t=9s\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Click here to see video titled &#8220;Legally right Morally Wrong.&#8221;<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Elmore explains what the City of Memphis and the County of Shelby did to him and the African\/American Memphis Community of &#8220;Orange Mound&#8221; is morally wrong.   Elmore explains we in Orange Mound made not only American Film history, we made World Film History.  The White Memphis Shelby County Film Commissioner Linn Sitler used her function and authority to erase Elmore&#8217;s  1988 Black produced Orange Mound film &#8220;The Contemporary Gladiator&#8221; out of Memphis Film History.<\/p>\n<p>In 2007 Memphis Shelby County Film Commissioner Linn Sitler and the Shelby County Historical Commision purposefully  inappropriately listed a film date on a Historical marker to racially make the 1989  White produced film &#8220;Mystery Train&#8221; be prior to the 1988  Black Memphis produced Film &#8220;The Contemporary Gladiator.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>The L.A. Times, Turner Classic Movies, T.V. Guide and IMDB (Internet Movie Database) all show that &#8220;The Contemporary Gladiator&#8221; is a 1988 Film Release and the White Memphis JIm Jarmusch produced movie &#8220;Mystery Train&#8221; is a 1989 Film Release. This manipulative  practice and culture in Memphis not only denies  Elmore out of his rightful place in Memphis film history, this Memphis culture denies  the African\/American Community of Orange Mound out of its  Memphis film history.<\/p>\n<p>Elmore learned in December of 2023 that his 1988 Film release &#8220;The Contemporary Gladiator is the 1st Kickboxing film made in World Film History.&#8221;  Elmore on January 16, 2024 wrote letters to President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.  Elmore explained in his letter to the President and Vice President that via our 1988 film we represent American culture and values.<\/p>\n<p>The 1989 film Kickboxer starring Jean Claude Van Damme was filmed in Thailand whereas Elmore&#8217;s 1988 Film &#8220;The Contemporary Gladiator&#8221; is a film that begins in &#8220;Orange Mound&#8221; a Black Community in Memphis, Tennessee.  Orange Mound is the 1st Community in America built for Blacks by Blacks.  In 2016 1st Lady Michelle Obama named Orange Mound &#8220;A Preserve America Community.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While Memphis, Tennessee is the largest populated African\/American city in America most noted as the city where Dr. Martin Luther King was brutally assassinated Anthony &#8220;Amp&#8221; Elmore who is a 5 time world Kickboxing Champion is in the fight of his life to get not only his film acknowledged in Memphis, Elmore is fighting Black Memphis elected officials to get Black History recognized in Memphis.<\/p>\n<p>Please click on the following underlined titled: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FAqrSKrsppI\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Black Memphis Filmmaker Flights Indie Memphis for Black History Inclusion.<\/a>  Elmore explains in the video if it was not for modern technology Memphis could get away with White Supremacy, Racism and Black on Black Racism.  Elmore shows in the video how &#8220;The City of Memphis&#8221; acquiesce to White Supremacy, Racism and Black on Black Racism.<\/p>\n<p>Indie Memphis is a 26 year old Memphis arts organization that runs a national Film festival.  Ironically the Film Festival had never invited Black Filmmaker Anthony &#8220;Amp&#8221; Elmore whose 1988 film &#8216;The Contemporary Gladiator&#8221; starting production in 1987 10 years before there was an Indie Memphis.  In fact Anthony &#8220;Amp&#8221; Elmore a Black Memphis Filmmaker is &#8220;The Father of Independent Filmmaking in Memphis.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Indie Memphis invited Elmore to screen &#8220;The Contemporary Gladiator&#8221; at its 26th year Film Festival October 24th to 29th 2023.   In regards to his Memphis film history Indie Memphis refused to acknowledge Elmore&#8217;s film history or rightfully acknowledge him as &#8220;Memphis 1st Independent 35mm Theatrical Filmmaker &#8221;  Elmore withdrew from the film festival not wanting to be associated to any organization that outright racially discriminates against Black Memphis Film History.<\/p>\n<p>Elmore explains that one has to look no further than February 1, 2023; whereas Vice President Kamala Harris, Civil Rights Leader Rev. Al Sharpton, Filmmaker Spike Lee and Black Leaders worldwide attended the funeral of 29 year old Tyre Nichols who was brutally beaten to death by 5 Black Memphis police officers.  Such is evident of the abhorrent culture of Memphis Black on Black Racism and Black on Black racial discrimination in Memphis. <\/p>\n<p>In 2019 Memphis celebrated its &#8220;200th Bicentennial Celebration&#8221; whereas Memphis advertised a campaign called &#8220;Bring Your Soul.&#8221;     Elmore a filmmaker, Community Activist, Historian whose &#8220;Orange Mound Home was once &#8220;The Safari House Education and Cultural Center and Museum&#8221; whereas Elmore&#8217;s Orange Mound Home has the largest display of African furnishings in America;  Elmore honored Memphis  via becoming the 1st in Memphis history to produce a  film  regarding &#8220;Black Memphis history.&#8221;  The film is titled &#8220;200 Years of Black Memphis History.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Elmore&#8217;s film was denied a place in the official celebration whereas he complained about the discrimination to African\/American Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris who only offered Elmore a &#8220;Tweet.&#8221;    Elmore rented the Malco Majestic Theatre May 22, 2019  to premier the film.  Elmore also uploaded the film to be shown free on Youtube for everyone.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C-eV_NbzkLU\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Click Here to see The Film is titled &#8220;200 Years of Black Memphis History.&#8221;<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The silence and racism regarding obscuring Elmore&#8217;s and the Orange Mound Black Film history comes from not only White Memphis, but also from Memphis Black Elected officials.<\/p>\n<p>Elmore wrote a letter to Newly Elected Memphis African\/American Mayor Paul Young asking that he address Memphis White Supremacy, Racism and Black on Black Racism via acknowledging his and Orange Mound&#8217;s Black Memphis Film History.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Anthony &#8220;Amp&#8221; Elmore <br \/>Orange Mound Black Memphis Hollywood<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/682152390\/tel:+1 901-452-4330\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">+1 901-452-4330<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/682152390\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Orange Mound World Film History<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"cJocMNo7qJU\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Orange Mound World Film History\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/cJocMNo7qJU?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=6HM5bIUQXX1uldTO&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      January 24, 2024, 14:15 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/682152390\/black-orange-mound-world-film-history-black-memphis-filmmaker-battle-memphis-black-leaders-to-honor-black-film-history\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
