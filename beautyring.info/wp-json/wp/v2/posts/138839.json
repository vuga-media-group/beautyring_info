Whatever the contestant ended up with, Hall might offering them a chance to trade that for what was behind the curtain where the lovely Carol Merrill was standing.<\/p>\n<p>The costumes are an element of the show that still endures on the current incarnation of &#8220;Let\u2019s Make a Deal,&#8221; airing weekdays on CBS with Wayne Brady. But they came about quite by accident. In the early days of the show, audience members wore suits and nice dresses. Since Monty Hall selected contestants from the audience, one enterprising woman, hoping to get his attention, wore a sign around her neck with the inscription, \u201cRoses are red, violets are blue, I came here to deal with you!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hall was so delighted that he picked her. A number of viewers followed her lead and showed up at the &#8220;Let\u2019s Make a Deal&#8221; studio with signs hanging around their necks. This lasted a few months before another audience member showed up wearing an eye-catching hat that prompted Hall to pick her. That led to another series of episodes where audience members showed up with bizarre and ugly hats.<\/p>\n<p>Henry Koval, an assistant to the producers at the time, told co-author Nedeff, \u201cI can still remember the first costume I ever saw. It was a man dressed as the Jolly Green Giant. As I recall, he kept showing up on every taping day and getting tickets at the booth, dressed as the Jolly Green Giant. Looking back, I don\u2019t understand why they kept letting him in. It had reached that point where the audience had signs hanging around their necks and wearing funny hats, but a guy wearing the Jolly Green Giant was still pretty different from what everyone else was doing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe finally put him on the trading floor one day. As I recall, the thinking was that we were putting him down there to get rid of him. \u2018Give him what he wants and let him be there with Monty and then he\u2019ll go away.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWell, Monty was so intrigued by him that he made a deal with the guy. And then that episode aired, and at the next taping, everybody showed up wearing a costume.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There was no going back after that, and the costumed audience became an unexpected signature for &#8220;Let\u2019s Make a Deal.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Though enormously successful\u2014Monty Hall\u2019s creation premiered in December of 1963, and he would host &#8220;Let\u2019s Make a Deal&#8221; on-and-off for a total of 16 years\u2014the show\u2019s popularity overwhelmed him. Hall had hoped to be known as a jack-of-all-trades performer, a singer\/dancer\/actor\/host and any other type of show business he could think of. But he found himself typecast as \u201cTV game show host Monty Hall,\u201d a role that he had somewhat mixed feelings about.<\/p>\n<p>Robert Hall, Monty Hall\u2019s brother, explains in the book, \u201cI don\u2019t want people to think that Monty hated &#8216;Let\u2019s Make a Deal.&#8217; That\u2019s not true at all. He loved that show. He just didn\u2019t love it to a level that he was willing to let it be the only thing anybody knew him for.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Hall very likely would have preferred to be remembered for his philanthropic efforts. Criss-crossing the country tirelessly to host telethons and fundraisers for decades, Hall raised over $1 billion for assorted charities during his lifetime, devoting a considerable portion of this effort to Variety Club, the children&#8217;s charity.<\/p>\n<p>The book, a revised and expanded version of Hall\u2019s original 1973 memoir co-written with Bill Libby, includes new research by author Adam Nedeff, who also conducted new interviews with models Carol Merrill and Karen LaPierre, announcers Brian Cummings and Dean Goss, &#8220;The People&#8217;s Court&#8221; creator Stu Billett, producer Ron Greenberg (&#8220;The Who, What, or Where Game&#8221;), and fellow master of ceremonies Tom Kennedy (&#8220;Split Second,&#8221; &#8220;Name That Tune&#8221;). These were the final interviews granted by Billett and Kennedy. Author Nedeff also devotes an entire chapter of the revised book to explaining, hopefully once and for all, the \u201cMonty Hall Problem,\u201d a confusing probability conundrum that has spurred arguments even among the most expert mathematicians.<\/p>\n<p>BearManor Media, a publisher specializing in books about vintage show business history, is offering the book in hardcover and paperback on its website, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bearmanormedia.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.bearmanormedia.com<\/a>, and buyers who use the promo code BIGDEAL at checkout can get 30% off their purchase through the end of December.<\/p>\n<p>Co-author Adam Nedeff is a West Virginia native who specializes in game shows.
