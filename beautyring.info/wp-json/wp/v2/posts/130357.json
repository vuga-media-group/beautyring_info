Muth found himself in circles of 2010s technology executives, venture capitalists, lowercase-L libertarians, crypto-nouveau-riche, and \u201csingularity\u201d enthusiasts very excited about radical lifespan extension or \u201ctechnologically-enhanced\u201d longevity. Today, however, Muth is instead focused on quality over quantity; specifically, the best life possible within a known lifespan and ending on a planned date with little pain and few regrets. Self-Inflicted is the product of the arguments that changed his mind.<\/p>\n<p>Drawing from historical evidence, challenging questions and thought experiments, Muth confronts the cultural perception of suicide and death. He asserts that due to the precious nature of our life spans,  control over one&#8217;s mortality should be a basic human right. Muth&#8217;s hope is that readers will walk away from this book with a newfound understanding of the cultural, moral and legal assumptions surrounding suicide, and will have an open mind on whether society should adopt a more liberal stance regarding the choice to end one\u2019s life. <\/p>\n<p>Excerpt from the book:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;By anticipating and planning death, we can come closer to an ideal where we live lives we choose instead of merely drifting through lives that happened to us. And we can end those lives with a choreographed, painless, consensual event rather than an unexpected fatal misfortune.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Self-Inflicted: Confronting the Suicide Taboo by <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?i=stripbooks&amp;rh=p_27%3AKarl+T+Muth&amp;s=relevancerank&amp;text=Karl+T+Muth&amp;ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Dr. Karl T.
