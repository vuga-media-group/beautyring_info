From the policy maker\u2019s point of view, the Federal Reserve, the Administration, the argument is that the rate of inflation has come down over the last 18 months. That\u2019s a very positive development. The problem is that on an individual level, people are seeing that eggs are up 100% over what they were seeing 4 years ago. Meat, coffee, bread, all those essentials are up. For many, prices have gone up faster than wages or income. For many, real income has actually declined over the last 3 years because inflation has picked up at a faster pace than wages and salaries. We see this convergence more critically than we did in the last 2 decades. So there is a big disparity.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>John continues, \u201cInflation was created when the Federal Reserve printed a lot of money to deal with COVID and the state shutdowns. That liquidity in the system boosted prices and barriers to a higher standard of living. In addition, the federal government, in terms of fiscal policy, spent a lot of money during COVID, so that gets into the system, causing the total demand on the economy to go up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As an economist, John blames supply and demand. \u201cWhat happened, under COVID, was shipping became limited across countries, trucking was limited and the net result was a big increase in domestic demand without a commensurate increase in supply. This tension caused prices to go up. During the past 6 months, timelines have improved and unfilled orders are down, so we\u2019re catching up in terms of the supply chain, but many are still experiencing the tension between supply and demand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways for Americans to insulate themselves from inflation is to invest in the stock market. John explains, \u201cThe problem goes back to being actively involved in the stock market. Not everyone owns stock, pensions, or IRAs. Forty percent of Americans do not own stock, which is an issue.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to keep in mind that stockholders are people who own IRAs, pensions, etc., Wall Street refers to institutional investors. Explains John, \u201cThere has been a long term debate that management and CEOs cater to the short term focus of generating profits and returns instead of the long term benefits of their companies and society in general. For example, when institutional investors are making estimates that a company ought to earn $0.10 this quarter, management often feels they need to at least come close to $0.10. So the temptation is there to manage the company with that short-term goal in mind. Over time, management has to think about the end-run goal for his or her company and for society. Too many companies, managers, and investors, are in this game for the short run.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another challenge facing Americans is home prices. \u201cIf you own a home, you are wealthier on paper because your home price has gone up over the last 4 years, significantly. The problem comes in with younger people, who don\u2019t own property and are finding themselves stranded. With higher mortgage rates (6-7%) and higher home prices, this cohort does have barriers to entry,\u201d laments John.<\/p>\n<p>Another challenge facing the economy is consumer credit. \u201cWhen we look at consumer credit data published by the Federal Reserve, we are seeing delinquencies in terms of credit cards and auto loans. When we look at those statistics by age (although not a perfect proxy for income but pretty close), we see that younger cohorts are having a much higher delinquency rates than older cohorts (45 and up). This disparity is historically a problem for policy makers,\u201d shared John.<\/p>\n<p>Wages are also contributing to the disparity. According to John, \u201cIf you need a machinist and can\u2019t find one offering $35\/hour, the time has come to consider paying $40\/hour. Employment is a negotiation between the business owner and the worker. If you can\u2019t negotiate, you shouldn\u2019t be in business. We saw this 6 or 9 months ago when fast food restaurants began raising entry-level wages independent of government action. These restaurants needed workers as they had customers who knew they wanted to buy hamburgers or chicken tenders. Restaurants had customers, but they didn\u2019t have enough employees to serve their customers. From my point of view, if you cannot find workers, raise the wage and find new ways to recruit employees. Business owners need to be able to step up to the plate and negotiate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Money does not create loyalty. \u201cOffering money alone creates a problem as someone will always outbid you. Employers have to create an environment where employees feel the company they work for is doing something good, whether it\u2019s helping out the community, or offering a great service. At Wells Fargo, we did a lot of work with Habitat for Humanity, which was wonderful for creating a sense of community and purpose,\u201d shares John.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, policy makers need to be more sensitive to the reality that their jobs are not just about lowering inflation. \u201cWe have to look at the broader impact to society when we see just the top 60% doing fine. Simply lowering inflation isn\u2019t improving the standard of living for people who do not own stock. We need to acknowledge that they have a tough time keeping up for many reasons: health, education, location. Right now, many Americans are feeling dissatisfied because their economic situation, in their minds, has not improved compared to what they\u2019ve seen in the past. And as a result, we are seeing a lot of disenchanted voters, which is a huge challenge. This is a tough scenario for many Americans,\u201d explains John.<\/p>\n<p>Author of 4 books on economics, John\u2019s latest book, Financial Markets and Economic Performance: A Model for Effective Decision Making, focuses on the details and mechanics of the economy and the financial system. \u201cIt\u2019s not glamorous, not about making a ton of money after investing for 5 days. It\u2019s about the fundamentals of economics and finance that came out of an MBA course I taught at Lake Forest University and Northwestern University.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Although officially retired, John is in demand offering limited consulting services to investment managers, bankers, and finance experts around the world through his consulting company, Dynamic Economic Strategy.
