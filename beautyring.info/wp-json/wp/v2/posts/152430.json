This year, the campaign has successfully raised over $300,000, having united 80 nonprofit organizations from 36 states, mental health specialists, businesses, and numerous esteemed equestrians and celebrity ambassadors, to expand the role of horses in mental health and personal growth.<\/p>\n<p>The Seen Through Horses Campaign, aligning with Mental Health Awareness Month, concludes today, May 31st, and calls for final donations by June 14th to support nonprofits providing vital mental health services through equine-assisted programs. This significant fundraising effort addresses the urgent need for mental health support in the U.S., where 1 in 5 individuals will experience mental illness in their lifetime, 132 people die by suicide each day, and depression is the number one disability worldwide. Despite the prevalence, only 46% of adults receive treatment, underscoring the critical need for accessible mental health resources in communities across the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>The 2024 Seen Through Horses Campaign has been the largest yet in expanding the role horses play in mental health and personal growth. Through the collaborative efforts of nonprofits, mental health professionals, celebrities, and influencers, the campaign has raised awareness and critical funds for programs integrating horses into mental health programs and services. These funds will enable nonprofits to offer services with horses to individuals facing conditions such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, or who are seeking personal growth and well-being services. <\/p>\n<p>Seen Through Horses has seen an incredible level of engagement from influencers and celebrity ambassadors including horse-loving advocates and award-winning actors, athletes,  journalists, musical artists, authors, and icons including Andrea Bocelli, Misdee Wrigley Miller, Apolo Ohno, Christy Cashman, Whey Jennings, Alex Hall, Allie Colleen, Nigel Barker, Sheri Salata, Jeremy Gauna, Eli Alger, Jodie Morton, Tony Stromberg, Gabriela Ruetter, Helen Pollock, and many more. These advocates emphasize the profound connection between humans and horses, helping to destigmatize mental health conversations and support local communities.<\/p>\n<p>All funds raised through the campaign go directly to the participating nonprofit organizations. These resources are vital for continuing and expanding mental health services, providing essential support to individuals in need. Many of these nonprofits expressly offer services to support our active duty military and veterans, and many offer free or sliding-scale services, ensuring that financial constraints do not hinder access to mental health care.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHorses for Mental Health encourages open conversations around mental health and uplifts nonprofits that incorporate horses into mental health and personal growth programs,\u201d says Tyler Brklacich, Horses for Mental Health Co-Founder and Executive Director. &#8220;By coming together we amplify the sector as a whole and break down stigma to promote healing. The success of the Seen Through Horses Campaign would not have been possible without the generous support of Zoetis U.S. Equine Division, in partnership with Horses for Mental Health.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can donate through June 14th by visiting horsesformentalhealth.org\/campaign which will directly go to supporting mental health programs and services. <\/p>\n<p>About Horses for Mental Health &amp; the Seen Through Horses Campaign<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nProduced by Horses for Mental Health, Seen Through Horses is a peer-to-peer campaign composed of individuals, nonprofits, mental health professionals, influencers, and businesses to increase awareness, public engagement, and raise funds to improve access to programs incorporating horses for mental health and personal growth.
