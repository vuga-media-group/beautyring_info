This year\u2019s edition will open with the U.S. premiere of Halder Gome\u2019s feature film \u201cMonet Red\u201d starring Maria Fernanda C\u00e2ndido, a coproduction between Brazil and Portugal, and close with the U.S. premiere \u201cMy Name is Gal\u201d, directed by Dandara Ferreira and L\u00f4 Politi, starring Sophie Charlotte as Brazilian Singer Gal Costa. The full lineup includes feature films, short films, animation, and networking sessions. Tickets are now available to purchase through the festival\u2019s labrff.com  \u201cWe kick off our 16th edition of LABRFF with an important mission: to continue to work very hard to promote the Brazilian cinema for the Latino community in the entertainment industry,\u201d said Meire Fernandes, Co-Founder of LABRFF.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMonet Red\u201d, tells the story of Johannes Van Almeida (Chico Diaz), a painter of women who are not accepted in the market; obsolete. With his vision deteriorating and on the verge of a nervous breakdown, he finds in Florence Lizz (Samantha M\u00fcller) \u2013 a famous actress in crisis and insecure in preparation for her most challenging film \u2013 the inspiration to make his masterpiece. Antoinette Lef\u00e8vre (Maria Fernanda C\u00e2ndido) is an influential art dealer\/connoisseur who sniffs out the value of works of art when stories of inspiration become an obsession among painters and models.  The film will open the festival on Monday, October 23rd  at the Culver Theater in Culver City,  followed by a cocktail party. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy Name is Gal\u201d by directors Dandara Ferreira and L\u00f4 Politi follows behind the scenes of the brief but effervescent period of Tropic\u00e1lia, the main counterculture movement in Brazil, responsible for the most significant musical and behavioral shifts the country has ever lived through. Gal Costa was the main voice behind Tropic\u00e1lia, but in order to achieve that position, she had to rid herself of a natural shyness that almost kept her from following her dreams. With her natural stage presence, attitude, body language, and amazing voice, Gal Costa would not only revolutionize the Brazilian music scene but become an icon for an entire generation, especially women. Our film portrays the hardships faced, at a very young age, by Gal and fellow artists Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Maria Bethania, Jards Macal\u00e9, Tom Z\u00e9, and Wally Salom\u00e3o, as they spearheaded a vanguardist cultural movement against the conservative values and violence imposed by Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. The film will close the festival on Thursday, October 26th at the Culver Theater in Culver City. <\/p>\n<p>The selected list of LABRFF this year features 16 films directed by female filmmakers, totaling 40% of the festival. The aesthetic and narrative diversity of Brazil is also present. 30% of the selected films were directed by filmmakers from the North and Northeast regions. International films are also included in the list, with 4 works by North American directors.<\/p>\n<p>FEATURES<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe program is composed of 22 feature films and 22 shorts from Brazil. Highlights include films that touch on subjects of self-discovery, forgiveness, and freedom, such as \u201cOur Dream &#8211; The Story of Claudinho and Buchecha\u201d by Eduardo Albergaria\u201d, \u201cThe Matriarch\u201d directed by Lula Oliveira, \u201cRio of Desire\u201d directed by Sergio Machado from Gullane Filmes, \u201cAut Virginia\u201d by Fabio Meira, \u201cHeavier is the Sky\u201d by Petrus Cariry, \u201cAlien Nights\u201d by S\u00e9rgio de Carvalho, \u201cHappy Family\u201d by  Jos\u00e9 Belmonte from Pandora Filmes, \u201cAngela\u201d by Hugo Prata\u201d \u201cThe Highjacking of Flight 375\u201d,  \u201cGauguin and the Canal\u201d directed by Frank Spano, among others.  <\/p>\n<p>LABRFF will also showcase a variety of documentaries including \u201cLupic\u00ednio Rodrigues, Confessions of a Suferrer\u201d about Brazilian composer Lupic\u00ednio Rodrigues who will be honored, \u201cin memoriam\u201d, during the Opening Night of LABRFF. In 2019, the family, Lupic\u00ednio Rodrigues, decided to research their family tree. Featuring previously unseen images, rare interviews, and moving interpretations sung by Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Caetano Veloso, the documentary takes a deep dive into Brazilian music as seen through the life of one of the country\u2019s most enigmatic artists. An artist defending a bohemian lifestyle as a basis for artistic creativity, facing the challenges of a changing music industry and a military dictatorship, and \u201cA Symphony For A Common Man\u201d about the Brazilian ambassador Jos\u00e9 Bustani, the first director of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, who tried to avoid the destruction of Iraq but was forced out under pressure from the USA. Today, similar situations are repeating themselves in multilateral organizations.<\/p>\n<p>These films will be celebrating their U.S. premieres and the full lineup is available at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/labrff.com\/film-guide\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">labrff.com\/film-guide<\/a>.
