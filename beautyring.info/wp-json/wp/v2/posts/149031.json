Making the safest and most effective skin and beauty products using plant-based ingredients instead of ones derived from petrochemicals or synthetic ingredients is a good start. <\/p>\n<p>Adopting triple bottom line in all their decision-making puts equal emphasis on social sustainability and environmental sustainability along with economic sustainability.<\/p>\n<p>Planet-first Mindset<\/p>\n<p>In order to continuously enhance their sustainability practices, it has become a part of their culture to think with a planet-first mindset every day. From sourcing sustainably grown organic ingredients to formulating, manufacturing, packaging, shipping, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Ongoing Sustainability Initiatives<\/p>\n<p>OM Botanical understands that true sustainability requires continuous effort and innovation. As such, the company has implemented a range of initiatives to minimize its environmental footprint across all aspects of its operations:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tCarbon Neutrality: OM Botanical is actively working towards achieving carbon neutrality by investing in renewable energy sources and offsetting its carbon emissions through verified carbon offset projects.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tWater Conservation: The company has implemented water-saving measures in its production processes, minimizing water usage and wastewater generation.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tIngredient Sourcing: OM Botanical prioritizes the use of organic and ethically sourced ingredients, supporting sustainable farming practices and minimizing environmental impact.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tMinimalist Formulations: OM Botanical&#8217;s product formulations are designed to be as minimalist as possible, reducing the use of unnecessary chemicals and ensuring biodegradability.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tMixing in Small batch When it comes to mixing their plant-based formulas they only make exactly what\u2019s needed, when it\u2019s needed. This eliminates excess or expired inventory that can end up polluting landfills. This practice also ensures that their products are as fresh and potent as possible when they arrive at customer\u2019s doorsteps.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tIn-house Manufacturing: OM Botanical mixes, packages, labels, codes, ships, all from their own lab in Apex, NC. They don\u2019t use any sub-contractors, or co-packers so they don\u2019t have to ship products around to multiple facilities. Thus further reducing their carbon footprint,<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tSustainable Packaging Solutions: Embracing Carbon Neutral Sugarcane Packaging<\/p>\n<p>In line with its eco-conscious values, OM Botanical has transitioned to using sustainable sugarcane packaging for its product lines. Sugarcane packaging is a renewable resource that minimizes reliance on petroleum-based plastics, which often end up polluting our oceans and landfills. By embracing sugarcane packaging, OM Botanical demonstrates its commitment to reducing their carbon footprint and promoting eco-friendly alternatives. The company&#8217;s dedication to sustainable packaging extends beyond Earth Day, forming a cornerstone of its ongoing efforts to protect the planet for future generations.<\/p>\n<p>Planting Trees for a Greener Future<\/p>\n<p>In partnership with Trees for the Future, OM Botanical plants one tree for every product they sell. To commemorate Earth Day and amplify its commitment to environmental stewardship, OM Botanical is launching a special initiative throughout the month of April. For every product sold during this period, OM Botanical will plant two trees in collaboration with reforestation organizations.<\/p>\n<p>This initiative not only helps offset carbon emissions but also contributes to reforestation efforts worldwide, restoring vital ecosystems and supporting biodiversity. By empowering customers to make a positive impact with their purchases, OM Botanical reinforces the importance of collective action in preserving our planet.<\/p>\n<p>Join OM Botanical in Celebrating Earth Day<\/p>\n<p>As Earth Day approaches, OM Botanical invites consumers to join in its mission to protect the planet and promote sustainability. By choosing OM Botanical&#8217;s organic skincare products, consumers can support a company that prioritizes environmental responsibility at every step of the production process.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTogether, we can make a difference for the Earth and future generations,\u201d says Sudhir Shah, CEO of OM Botanical.
