However, edema and lymphedema are clearly not the same and require different treatment approaches. Lymphedema affects 140-250 million women, men and children worldwide and results from the inability of the lymphatic system to perform one of its basic functions, the removal of water and protein from the tissues of a certain portion of the body. This insufficiency can be caused by developmental abnormalities of the lymphatic system (primary lymphedema) or damage to the lymphatic system such as the removal and\/or radiation of lymph nodes in cancer surgery (secondary lymphedema).<\/p>\n<p>In It\u2019s Not Just a Swelling! \u2013 LYMPHEDEMA patients affected by Lymphedema and Lipedema are provided with an up-to-date and comprehensive guide to effectively manage these conditions. The book is also a valuable resource for caregivers, and family members of affected individuals. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nTopics include: Anatomy of the Lymphatic System &#8211; Causes of Primary and Secondary Lymphedema and their Stages &#8211; Complications of Lymphedema, such as Infections, Cellulitis, Leakage &#8211; Lymphedema Risk Reduction, Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts for Lymphedema &#8211; Prevention of Lymphedema &#8211; Lymphedema and its Impact on Quality of Life &#8211; Treatment and Management of Lymphedema &#8211; Self-Management of Lymphedema (Self-MLD, Skin Care, Compression Therapy, Exercises) &#8211; Nutritional Aspects &#8211; Traveling with Lymphedema &#8211; And Much More &#8211; more details below.<\/p>\n<p>About The Author Joachim Zuther, world-renowned Lymphedema Specialist, author of the bestselling textbook &#8220;Lymphedema Management \u2013 A comprehensive Guide for Practitioners&#8221;, and co-author of numerous chapters in textbooks for Lymphedema. Mr. Zuther is a member of the International Society of Lymphology (ISL), the National Lymphedema Network (NLN), and the German Association of Lymphology (DGL).
