The hotel, set upon the banks of the iconic <span class=\"xn-person\">River Clyde<\/span> and just a stone&#8217;s throw away from Central Station, features a prime location ideal for exploring the city. Boasting Virgin Hotels&#8217; beloved Chamber design, an array of modern dining and drinking venues and influences from the local culture, the <span class=\"xn-location\">Glasgow<\/span> hotel combines the brand&#8217;s celebrated hospitality standards with distinctive experiences that reflect the soul of the city.<\/p>\n<p>The hotel is home to 240 exquisitely decorated Chambers, each flooding with natural light and brimming with thoughtful features that optimize the space. Wood-sliding doors separate the sleep and relaxation lounge from the dressing area in every room, giving guests optimum privacy. The dressing room features a stand-alone vanity unit with a mounted illuminated mirror, and the lounge itself has a Virgin Hotels&#8217; patented and ergonomic bed with a channel-tufted headboard; Hypnos mattress; a red SMEG\u00ae mini-fridge generously stocked with local products; plugs in all the convenient places; an HDTV and a yoga mat.<\/p>\n<p>The attention-to-detail continues throughout the rest of the hotel. <b><span class=\"xn-person\">Teddy Mayer<\/span><\/b>, creative director and vice president of design at Virgin Hotels, worked closely with Silk\u00a0Property Group to pay homage to <span class=\"xn-location\">Glasgow&#8217;s<\/span> rich history and prominent shipping industry. The hotel&#8217;s nautical elements are infused with modern twists, elegantly capturing <span class=\"xn-location\">Glasgow&#8217;s<\/span> vibrant spirit from a contemporary perspective. Upon entering the hotel, guests are met with stunning design features that open up the space and ignite their desire to explore, including vaulted ceilings, antiquated glass and a grand staircase. Public areas feature open floor plans, velvet chairs and sweeping views of the city, creating a warm and convivial ambiance for conversation between new and old friends alike.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In collaboration with Visto Art, the hotel has also been decorated with beautifully bespoke artwork, all created by local Scottish illustrators, painters and photographers. Each of the diverse pieces are inspired by the city&#8217;s rich heritage, from an impressive mural spraypainted by several of the city&#8217;s most creative street artists to the friezes that depict <span class=\"xn-location\">Glasgow<\/span> with an abstract eye.<\/p>\n<p>At the heart of the hotel lies <b>Commons Club<\/b>, the flagship restaurant offering eclectic food and beverage in a playful yet sophisticated space. Under the direction of Executive Chef <span class=\"xn-person\">Jean-Paul Giraud<\/span>, Commons Club boasts a contemporary restaurant menu with global inspirations, serving unexpected and bold flavors with locally sourced ingredients.
