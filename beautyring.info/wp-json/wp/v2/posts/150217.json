Its\u2019 110,000 square-foot showroom headquartered in Pompano Beach, FL. hosts an array of quality interior design styles, including many Italian furniture lines. Clients have included high end restaurants, commercial offices, hotels, and private residential homes designed for A List celebrities.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nInteriors President and Founder, Steven Gurowitz said he is thrilled to help bring Haddish\u2019s message of the importance of joy and service to South Florida audience.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTiffany has a great story,\u201d Gurowitz said. \u201cShe definitely was not raised with a silver spoon in her mouth. Her life story and battle with literacy will resonate with readers I&#8217;m sure.  Her book is going to be a winner and I expect this event will sell out fast.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Embrace Foundation Founder and CEO, Velma Lawrence said all proceeds will benefit the Embrace Girls Foundation Literacy Initiative, which was created to combat alarming reading deficits among children that were magnified by school closures during the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>Nearly 40 percent of children nationally cannot read at their grade level, including almost 70 percent of fourth graders from low-income households and nearly 49 percent of students who qualify for free or reduced-price school meals, according to National Literacy Institute statistics.<\/p>\n<p>Lawrence said many girls entering Embrace programs read two grades below their class level.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Casino at Dania Beach is extremely proud of our continued partnership with The Embrace Girls Foundation,\u201d said the casino\u2019s Director of Entertainment and Events, Joe Eshkenazi. \u201cFor the past four years we have produced many sold out shows in a variety of genres for an extremely important cause. This event featuring Tiffany Haddish and promoting literacy is another example of what we can do together moving forward.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are truly blessed to have such dedicated partners that truly understand and embrace our passion for service and commitment to providing educational, social and life skills training to our girls and resources and services to their families, school and communities,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIt does indeed take a village.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTiffany gets it and the book, oh my, it&#8217;s a must read.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Born and raised in South Central Los Angeles, Haddish overcame a difficult upbringing \u2013 her father left the family when she was three. As a child she learned to tell jokes as a way to placate her violently schizophrenic mother. She and her four siblings spent time in foster care in separate homes. Haddish said she could not read well until she was in high school, where she was encouraged by a teacher to improve her reading skills. Still, when she graduated from high school Haddish, at 17 years old, had to live out of her car as she tried to launch a comedy career.<\/p>\n<p>Her experiences of having to carry her possessions in black plastic bags while moving through the foster care system prompted Haddish to create the Suitcase Drive for Foster Youth program, which provides suitcases to children in the foster care system through her charity, the She Ready Foundation.<\/p>\n<p>Moved by Haddish&#8217;s experience, Lawrence said she decided to pay it forward in honor of Haddish by replicating the service for foster children in the Miami\/Broward counties.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We will provide an area foster care agency with age-appropriate luggage that will include a stuffed animal, book and blanket,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cCan you imagine what joy that will bring to a child?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Haddish has had a stellar career, appearing in dozens of movies, television and comedy shows. Critics rated her \u201cGirls Trip\u201d performance as one of the best of the 21st century.<\/p>\n<p>Haddish won the 2021 Best Comedy Album Grammy Award for her \u201cBlack Mitzvah\u201d album and a 2018 prime time Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for hosting Saturday Night Live.<\/p>\n<p>Her children\u2019s book, \u201cThe Last Black Unicorn,\u201d was a New York Times bestseller. <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n&#8220;I Curse You With Joy&#8221; will be released May 7 and can be pre-ordered on Amazon.com.<\/p>\n<p>Lawrence said Embrace took dozens of its members to Lantana, Fla last May to see Haddish read from her book.<\/p>\n<p>Tickets are exclusively available at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.CasinoDaniaBeach.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.CasinoDaniaBeach.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about The Embrace Girls Foundation, Inc., programs or to donate call 877-466-4769, or visit the website at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.embracegirlpower.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.embracegirlpower.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Velma Lawrence<br \/>Embrace Girls Foundation Inc.<br \/>+1 877-466-4769<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/707833449\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/embracegirlpwr\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/embracegirlpwr\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/the-embrace-girls-foundation-inc-b557a5238\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/embracegirlpower\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Actress\/Singer Keke Palmer visits Embrace Girls Foundation<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"_Dl_p2Wrlyo\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Keke Palmer Advocates for The Embrace Girls Foundation\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/_Dl_p2Wrlyo?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=90JKtyJQpIxBOUgQ&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      May 01, 2024, 21:58 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/707833449\/award-winning-actor-tiffany-haddish-at-casino-at-dania-beach-for-embrace-girls-foundation-tea-talk-fundraiser\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
