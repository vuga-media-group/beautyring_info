In other words, this procedure \u2013 which involves the repositioning and restructuring of deep facial tissue \u2013 can allow patients to enjoy a more youthful, refreshed, and rejuvenated look. In addition, Dr. Richards explains, the surgery can dramatically reduce the severity of age-related concerns like sagging skin, deep creases, and jowls.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Richards states that it is common for prospective facelift patients to have questions about what to expect. In the interest of keeping his patients feeling informed and comfortable, he is always happy to answer such questions. Below, Dr. Richards provides answers to four of the most common facelift questions he is asked every day.<\/p>\n<p>1. Does a facelift address the entire face?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAccording to Dr. Richards, a facelift primarily targets the lower half of the face and upper neck. Because the procedure does not typically involve the forehead or eyelids, patients with these additional goals may opt to combine facelift surgery with <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.drmarkrichards.com\/face\/brow-forehead-lift-washington-dc\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">brow lift<\/a> surgery, blepharoplasty, or another option.<\/p>\n<p>2. Is facelift surgery painful?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDr. Richards explains that facelift surgery is generally not considered painful. Patients might experience some discomfort, swelling, and bruising in the days following the procedure; however, these phenomena usually resolve rapidly and are mitigated with prescribed medications. <\/p>\n<p>3. How long does facelift surgery recovery take?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDr. Richards advises that the initial facelift recovery period typically takes about two weeks, during which swelling and bruising should diminish significantly. Most patients can resume more strenuous activities (e.g. intensive exercise) within a month after the procedure. Dr. Richards also notes that complete healing and final results can take several months to appear, as the residual swelling requires time to subside.<\/p>\n<p>4. Will facelift surgery results look natural?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nWhen facelift surgery is performed by an experienced provider, the results should look very natural, says Dr. Richards. While he understands that lower quality procedures are associated with a \u201cwindswept\u201d or \u201cpulled\u201d look, he assures patients that a surgeon with the proper training will aim to create effects that flatter a patient\u2019s natural beauty, rather than produce a manufactured appearance.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, Dr. Richards urges any patient seeking facelift surgery to consult a reputable provider. Doing so, he says, can be the difference between a satisfactory and unsatisfactory plastic surgery experience. <\/p>\n<p>About Mark Richards, MD<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe former Plastic Surgery Consultant to the White House, Mark Richards, MD is a celebrated physician with nearly four decades in practice.
