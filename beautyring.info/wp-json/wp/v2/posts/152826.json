Then we found out that they were going to present <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/anakeesta.com\/astralumina\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Astra Lumina Night Walk<\/a> at Anakeesta in Gatlinburg by our sister property Wilderness at the Smokies. We were so excited by how Anakeesta&#8217;s project turned out that we then commissioned Moment Factory to create Kaleiodoscope Kavern <s>\u2013 <\/s>the world&#8217;s first immersive lazy river for us at our Smokies property. We&#8217;re now so incredibly excited to be bringing Aquavia Lumina to the Dells so our resort can highlight the natural beauty of the Dells&#8217; sandstone cliffs that made our region first become a tourist destination.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>On the enchanted Aquavia Lumina Night Walk, visitors will enter a dreamlike world where nature is enhanced by lighting effects, video projections and original music. They will follow a mystical deer through the Wilderness Canyon in search of &#8216;The Source&#8217;, a legendary spring said to transform nature with the magic of water.<\/p>\n<p>Aquavia Lumina will be a family-oriented nighttime experience for people of all ages to experience when they visit <span class=\"xn-location\">Wisconsin Dells<\/span>. The fun will begin at nautical dusk so when the waterparks close for the evening families can be immersed in this magical multimedia attraction. Aquavia will be open at nightfall every month throughout the year.
