Chemotherapy can reduce breast cancer recurrence risk but its yields are small and variable. Genomic analysis of the primary tumor is crucial in deciding whether adjuvant chemotherapy is needed in early estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Breast recurrence score (RS) assays help determine the chemotherapy benefits for early breast cancer patients.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) has conducted several clinical trials over the last four decades. The trial results have significantly contributed towards reducing the extent of surgical procedures and improving the outcome of patients with early-stage breast cancer.<\/li>\n<li>The NSABP B-14 trial showed lower distant recurrence rates in low-risk patients, while the NSABP-B20 trial showed significant benefits in high-risk tumors. The test generates a recurrence score between 0 and 100.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">The breast recurrence\u00a0score test can dramatically lower treatment rates and enhance decision-making for individuals who were previously considered to benefit only little from chemotherapy.
