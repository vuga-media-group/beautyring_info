Through robust programming that gives meaning to the word &#8220;diverse,&#8221; the selections in this year&#8217;s festival illuminate the experiences of those living in the African diaspora around the world.  The New York-based husband-and-wife programmers, Reinaldo Barroso-Spech and Diarah N&#8217;Daw-Spech, have chosen more than a dozen films that, through a variety of modes and genres, further dimensionalize already complex issues specific to those living in these communities. Naturally, documentary lends itself to this mission, though several narrative features and a short fiction add to the plenitude of information.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/\/\\\\==++==\/\/<\/p>\n<p>The Best of ADIFF is made possible thanks to the support of the following institutions and individuals: ArtMattan Productions; the Office of the Vice President for Diversity and Community Affairs, Teachers College, Columbia University and the New York City Council in the Arts.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Diarah N&#8217;Daw-Spech<br \/>ArtMattan Films<br \/>+1 212-864-1760<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/676391528\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=K4-exgNEMBslsSua&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      December 21, 2023, 13:36 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/676391528\/line-up-announced-for-the-best-of-the-31st-annual-african-diaspora-international-film-festival-january-12-14-2024\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
