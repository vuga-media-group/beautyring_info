(NASDAQ: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ticket-symbol\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#financial-modal\">BKNG<\/a>) today announced that it intends to appeal the European Commission&#8217;s recently announced decision to prohibit the Company&#8217;s acquisition of Etraveli Group, from CVC Capital Partners (&#8220;CVC&#8221;), to the European courts.<\/p>\n<p>The Company strongly believes the Commission is wrong on both the facts of the case and the law applicable to this transaction, which was cleared unconditionally by multiple competition authorities, including the UK Competition &amp; Markets Authority and U.S. FTC.\u00a0 The Commission has fundamentally misconstrued the highly competitive travel markets for flights and accommodations, and its decision is an unexplainable departure from the Commission&#8217;s own Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines, which are legally binding on the Commission. The acquisition, which would have combined two separate but complementary <span class=\"xn-location\">Europe<\/span>-based businesses operating within separate, highly competitive industries, would have delivered tremendous benefits for consumers and partners by bringing more options and competitive pricing.\u00a0 Booking Holdings regrets very much the lack of convergence of the European Commission with other major international enforcers on this pro-competitive transaction.<\/p>\n<p>The European Commission&#8217;s decision does not alter Booking Holdings&#8217; commitment to continue building its already growing and successful flights offering at Booking.com, and providing increased choice and transparency for consumers, as the company today also announces an extension of an existing and long-standing commercial partnership agreement between Booking.com and Etraveli Group through at least December 2028.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>While the acquisition would have allowed Booking.com to fully harness all of Etraveli Group&#8217;s capabilities and management team to offer a better flights product and better deals for consumers through, among other things, greater strategic and commercial alignment and enhanced integration, the continued partnership with Etraveli Group will further strengthen and accelerate Booking.com&#8217;s ongoing work to build a frictionless global flights offering, which is already live in over 50 countries, and deliver even more value to travelers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The European Commission&#8217;s decision not only departs from settled law and precedent but it deprives consumers of travel options that they are entitled to have,&#8221; said Booking Holdings&#8217; Chief Executive Officer, <span class=\"xn-person\">Glenn Fogel<\/span>. &#8220;We are proud of the progress we are making in providing a high quality flights product through our existing commercial partnership with Etraveli Group. Today we are pleased to announce an extension of that partnership through 2028, and as we go forward together, our focus will continue to be on advancing the creation of a better, more flexible consumer travel experience that provides more value to customers and partners.&#8221;\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>About Booking Holdings<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b><span>Booking Holdings (<\/span>NASDAQ<span>:
