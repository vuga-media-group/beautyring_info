By making the connection between food and health, children and adults alike can learn to appreciate the benefits of a balanced lifestyle. <\/p>\n<p>About the Author<\/p>\n<p>Growing up in the beautiful village of Glencolmcille, Co Donegal, Ireland, Christina saw firsthand what homemade food was all about. Coming from a family of seven siblings, they ate simple, wholesome food. Yes, sweets crept in during the week, but mainly they ate wholesome foods.<\/p>\n<p>At school, she became fascinated with how the foods they ate fueled bodies and was hungry for more information. After missing out on the grades to study Home Economics teaching, she studied Chemistry and went on to work in finance. But her passion and love for nutrition never left her. Ten years later, she retrained as a Nutritional Therapist and now feel she have come full circle to bring this information to everyone.<\/p>\n<p>Her passion lies in helping you become your best caregiver by creating healthy habits for your body and mind. This is her life\u2019s work and service to all.<\/p>\n<p>The inspiration for \u201cColourful Foods and Activities for my Body &amp; Mind\u201d came from a deep desire to inspire children from an early age to see the connection between food, exercise, and mindfulness as a holistic approach to health. Christina\u2019s goal is to encourage parents to get involved and relearn the habit changes necessary to pass on to their children.<\/p>\n<p>She is also passionate about breaking the cycle of dieting culture from one generation to the next. Let&#8217;s all take a collective breath and begin to see the power of what we put into our bodies daily. Food should be both nutritious and joyful, never a form of punishment. This book is her way of promoting a healthy, balanced lifestyle that fosters both physical and mental well-being.<\/p>\n<p>Message from the Author<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy book and inspiration come from a place of love, to love and respect our bodies is the ultimate self-care.
