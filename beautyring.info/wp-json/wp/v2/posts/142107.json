He is the fifth recipient to receive the award. Hoplamazian has been an integral voice on the issue of addiction in America, using his leadership in the industry to unite hospitality executives to take an active role in ending the addiction crisis.<\/p>\n<p>Senior executives across the hotel industry united during the Americas Lodging Investment Summit (ALIS) in <span class=\"xn-location\">Los Angeles<\/span> to commend Hoplamazian on his accomplishments. More than 60 hospitality companies raised <span class=\"xn-money\">$2 million<\/span> during the event to advance the important work Shatterproof is doing and to support its Founder and CEO, <span class=\"xn-person\">Gary Mendell<\/span>, a former hotelier (chairman and co-founder of HEI Hotels and Resorts), who lost his son Brian to addiction in 2011.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">&#8220;I am honored to receive this award, but more importantly, to help raise critical support for Shatterproof and the transformational work they are doing,&#8221; said Hoplamazian. &#8220;Hyatt is proud to collaborate with Shatterproof as they lead the way in advocating for people with substance use disorders, their families and the communities this disease impacts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>According to the\u00a0Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA), employees of restaurants and hotels (the two major branches of the hospitality industry) have the highest rates of substance use out of the entire American workforce. Service occupations, such as those in the food and hospitality industries, had the second highest proportion of workers with substance use disorders\u2014 15.6%. A substance use disorder doesn&#8217;t just affect employees themselves and their families; businesses lose enormous sums every year as a result of the issue in the form of higher health care costs, absenteeism and presenteeism (when employees are at work, but not fully productive).<\/p>\n<p>Mendell founded Shatterproof with a goal of improving the way that our healthcare system prevents and treats treatment quality, addressing the shame and stigma associated with substance use disorders, and advancing evidence-based policies. Since 2016, the hospitality industry has raised more than <span class=\"xn-money\">$5 million<\/span> for Shatterproof during events at ALIS.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">&#8220;I continue to be inspired by the incredible support of the hotel industry,&#8221; said Mendell. &#8220;Substance use disorder is a largely preventable disease, and it is through the generous support and awareness efforts of the hospitality industry that we will be able to reduce stigma and increase the number of policy changes and treatment resources to end this crisis.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\"><b>The 2024 Shatterproof Hospitality Heroes Committee includes <\/b><span class=\"xn-person\">Robert Alter<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Geoff Ballotti<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Mike Barnello<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">James Burba<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Patrick Campbell<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Thomas Corcoran<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Ted Darnall<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Joel Eisemann<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Clark Hanrattie<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Mark Hoplamazian<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Tim Hodes<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Merrick Kleeman<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Daniel Lesser<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Gary Mendell<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Chris Nassetta<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Bill Reynolds<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Anthony Rutledge<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Stacy Silver<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-person\">Paul Whetsell<\/span>, and <span class=\"xn-person\">Mark Woodworth<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\">For more information visit, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4076283-1&amp;h=2755744883&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shatterproofalis.org%2F&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shatterproofalis.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.shatterproofalis.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"prntaj\"><i>The term &#8220;Hyatt&#8221; is used in this release for convenience to refer to Hyatt Hotels Corporation and\/or one or more of its affiliates.<\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>About Shatterproof:<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4076283-1&amp;h=1842605083&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shatterproof.org%2F&amp;a=Shatterproof+\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Shatterproof <\/a>is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to reversing the addiction crisis in the U.S. Shatterproof is focused on guiding communities, removing systematic barriers to recovery, mobilizing the country to advocate for change, and ending addiction stigma in the U.S. Find Shatterproof on Facebook, X and YouTube: @ShatterproofHQ or follow them on Instagram at @weareshatterproof.
