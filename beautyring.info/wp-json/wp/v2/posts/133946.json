It\u2019s a condition wherein seconds and minutes truly matter. For this reason, it\u2019s extremely important for everyone\u2014not just medical professionals\u2014to know how to identify the early signs and symptoms of a stroke. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/team\/mary-greene-md\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Dr. Mary Greene<\/a>, cardiologist and Director of Women\u2019s Health at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Manhattan Cardiology<\/a> and contributor to <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.labfinder.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.labfinder.com<\/a>, has all the details.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere are two main types of stroke. Ischemic strokes are caused by blood flow obstructions, such as blood clots. Hemorrhagic strokes are caused by ruptured blood vessels that leak blood into the brain. In both cases, the brain\u2019s supply of blood is disrupted, and the cells within the brain are quickly starved of oxygen. This can lead to permanent brain damage or even be fatal,\u201d said Dr. Greene.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone can have a stroke, but some things increase the likeliness that someone will suffer one. Some of the primary risk factors of stroke include:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tsmoking<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\theavy alcohol use<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\thigh blood pressure<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\thigh cholesterol<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\theart disease<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tdiabetes<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tobesity<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tsickle cell disease<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tprevious history of stroke<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tfamily history of stroke<\/p>\n<p>Some other special considerations include age, sex, and race or ethnicity. After the age of 55, the chance of having a stroke doubles every decade. Strokes are more common in women, and the risk of stroke can be increased during pregnancy or while taking birth control pills. The risk of having a stroke is higher for Blacks, and the risk of death from a stroke is higher for non-Hispanic Blacks and Pacific Islanders.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut it\u2019s also possible for someone without any of these risk factors to have a stroke, so knowing the signs is important for everyone. It\u2019s easiest to remember the acronym \u2018FAST,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Greene.<\/p>\n<p>F is for Face<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe brain is divided into two halves called hemispheres, and generally speaking each hemisphere controls the movements of one half of the body. Depending on where in the brain a stroke occurs, it can often cause motor control issues for one half of the body. One common sign of this is a droopiness one side of the face.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple test. If someone is suspected of having a stroke, ask them to smile. If they\u2019re having a stroke, one half of the smile will often droop and sag, and the corner of the mouth won\u2019t really rise. And frequently the person having the stroke won\u2019t be aware of this,\u201d said Dr. Greene.<\/p>\n<p>A is for Arms<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cAnother simple test is to ask someone to raise their arms up in the air. If they\u2019re having a stroke, they may find it difficult or impossible to hold up one of their arms, and it will noticeably drift downward,\u201d said Dr. Greene.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes the person will not even be able to lift their arm above their own head to begin with.<\/p>\n<p>S is for Speech<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nSpeech can be affected in many ways during a stroke. A person might suddenly lose the ability to speak. Other times, they might be able to form words, but the words are nonsensical or completely random. And for others, they might retain the ability to speak, but it suddenly becomes slurred.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTo check someone\u2019s speech, ask them to recite a simple phrase. It should be something that they would normally have no trouble saying, such as their name, home address, and phone number. If it sounds markedly off, or if they can\u2019t speak at all, they might be having a stroke,\u201d said Dr. Greene.<\/p>\n<p>T is for Time<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe last step in the test is perhaps the most crucial: act immediately.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBased on the previous three tests, if a person seems like they might be having a stroke the most important thing to do is call 911 right away,\u201d said Dr. Greene.<\/p>\n<p>A person who might be having a stroke should never drive themselves to the emergency room. Another responsible adult can drive them, but an ambulance is usually the best option.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd if you ask someone to do the smile test and they seem like they\u2019re having a stroke, just jump straight to 911. You don\u2019t have to display facial, arm, and speech symptoms all together in order to be having a stroke,\u201d Dr. Greene added.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to note that in some cases the symptoms might appear for a few minutes and then go away. This could be a sign of a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also sometimes called a mini-stroke. A TIA is just as serious a medical emergency as a stroke. If someone displays symptoms of a stroke, call 911, even if the symptoms appear to go away.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGetting medical attention quickly can be the difference between a full recovery and permanent disability or even death, so don\u2019t take any chances. If someone might be having a stroke, remember to always act FAST,\u201d said Dr. Greene.<\/p>\n<p>Manhattan Cardiology is the premier facility for cardiac testing and preventive treatment in<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nNew York. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.manhattancardiology.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.manhattancardiology.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Dr. Mary Greene is a cardiologist and Director of Women\u2019s Health at Manhattan Cardiology who emphasizes individualized treatment and preventative medicine. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/team\/mary-greene-md\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/manhattancardiology.com\/team\/mary-greene-md\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Contact: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mcprpublicrelations.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.mcprpublicrelations.com<\/a> <br \/>&#13;\n<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Melissa Chefec<br \/>MCPR, LLC<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/660960274\/tel:+ +1 203-968-6625\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">+ +1 203-968-6625<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/660960274\/mailto:melissa@mcprpublicrelations.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">melissa@mcprpublicrelations.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=Tzg4LX3bOgV9Xloz&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      <span>MCPR, LLC<\/span>\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      October 11, 2023, 13:30 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/660960274\/signs-of-a-stroke-and-why-immediate-response-is-necessary\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
