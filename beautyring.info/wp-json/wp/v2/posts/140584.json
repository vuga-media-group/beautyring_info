Focusing on self-care and healthy habits are the keys to living the life you want.\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Amy Lang<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>SAN FRANCISCO , CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES, January 9, 2024 \/<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/\" dir=\"auto\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">EINPresswire.com<\/a>\/ &#8212; Focusing on losing weight first and then figuring out how to keep it off is the roller coaster reality most dieters know all too well. But it certainly isn\u2019t the way to build and live a joyful life. Instead, nutrition coach and former health club owner <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.moxie-club.com\/about-amy\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Amy Lang<\/a> says, the secret is shifting our mindsets away from \u201cdiet culture\u201d and toward self-care. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cLasting weight loss is a byproduct of embracing healthy habits,\u201d Lang explains. Her mission is to solve the obesity problem, which also requires exposing the multibillion dollar diet and weight loss industry for the hoax that it is &#8212; expensive, ineffective and in the business of creating repeat customers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven if your physical health improves in the short-term, yo-yo dieting takes a huge toll on mental and emotional health,\u201d Lang says. \u201cHealthy habits don&#8217;t cause harmful stress in your body. They&#8217;re also sustainable and the best way to achieve your optimal weight.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Such habits are the basis of Joyful Eating, the self-care framework she&#8217;s pioneered, which she details in her book, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Thoughts-Are-Habits-Too-Rediscover\/dp\/1952654912\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Thoughts Are Habits Too<\/a>. Joyful Eating works, she says, &#8220;because the right self-care habits, with some patience and practice, make what&#8217;s truly important for the health of our brains and body happen automatically.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNo one is immune to the quick fix and diet culture surrounding us. No one is born knowing how to cope with stress or process their emotions. And certainly, no one is born knowing how to create habits by design,\u201d Lang notes. \u201cInstead of dieting and focusing on restriction, which lead to cravings and overeating, it&#8217;s far better to focus on what you can control and create the conditions for success.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Similar insights are woven throughout Thoughts Are Habits Too. Critical perspectives like:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tThe essential healthy habits for lasting weight loss <\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tWhy dieting makes weight loss unnecessarily hard<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tHow diet culture undermines self-worth and self-esteem<\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tThe key to breaking old habits <\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tHow to make peace with food<\/p>\n<p>Lang\u2019s understanding was born of her own experience. Her personal struggle with body image and weight started when she was a teenager and continued into her mid-thirties. After a successful decade-long stint in high tech, working at Oracle, Netscape and Yahoo, in 2004 she decided to leave high tech to pursue her passion by becoming the owner of Pacific Heights Health Club. Over the next 15 years, she and her team helped thousands of clients lose weight and achieve their health and wellness goals.<\/p>\n<p>She discovered what worked and what didn&#8217;t work when it came to making habits stick, which led her to start her &#8220;Happy and Healthy with Amy Lang&#8221; podcast and online coaching company called <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.moxie-club.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Moxie Club<\/a>, in addition to writing her bestselling book. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cRediscovering joyful eating is within the reach of all of us,\u201d she says. \u201cFood isn&#8217;t the problem. And focusing on portion control only makes it worse. Instead, focusing on self-care and healthy habits are the keys to living the life you want.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>###<\/p>\n<p>For a review copy of Thoughts Are Habits Too and\/or to interview Lang, contact gary@weroar.la<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Gary Schneeberger<br \/>ROAR<br \/>+1 818-309-8580<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/679858615\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hellomoxieclub\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/moxie-club\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCzbYncPzmAfv2HFyP2myMqw\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=9_225Yvs5MaADFG_&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      January 09, 2024, 22:45 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/679858615\/self-love-joyful-eating-not-self-loathing-endless-diets-make-weight-loss-last-author-and-master-health-coach-says\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
