Tieshena is the ideal leader to continue this critical work. Her entrepreneurial expertise, deep operational knowledge, emphasis on data-driven decision making, and commitment to making publishing a more inclusive and accessible industry will help to lead IBPA as it grows and strengthens. She is also a wonderful collaborator, and I am proud and excited to partner with her in the year ahead.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI am thrilled to assume the role of IBPA\u2019s incoming board chair,\u201d said Davis. \u201cThe association has been a beacon of inspiration and growth throughout my professional journey, and I am truly grateful to the outgoing chair, Karen, for her trailblazing leadership and unwavering dedication. I\u2019m prepared to build upon her accomplishments and aid the organization in reaching new heights of operational excellence, innovation, and influence.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Appointed to the board in 2018, Pavlicin served four years as a director prior to her two years as chair, leading and contributing to many strategic initiatives and task forces. After her board service, Pavlicin will continue to serve on the Governance Committee as immediate-past board chair and intends to stay involved with IBPA projects close to her heart, such as expanding executive education and support for mid-sized and established publishers, and continuing to strengthen IBPA\u2019s DEI integration and leadership development.<\/p>\n<p>IBPA also wishes to recognize two board members who will term off the board together with Pavlicin at the end of this fiscal year: Victoria Sutherland, publisher of Foreword Reviews, and Annette Hobbs-Magier, owner of Magier Marketing &amp; PR.
