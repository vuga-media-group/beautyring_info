Beyond the adrenaline-soaked tales, &#8220;The Tome of Ding&#8221; offers a unique perspective on colonial life in Kenya and the author&#8217;s experiences growing up in New Zealand. Through the eyes of a man from a distant era, readers are transported to a time long ago and a place far away, experiencing the author&#8217;s life in vivid detail.<\/p>\n<p>The book takes on a poignant tone with the inclusion of the author&#8217;s ninety-seven-year-old father&#8217;s narratives. From WWII service to navigating the challenges of the Mau Mau Emergency in Kenya, the book artfully blends personal and historical accounts. The author&#8217;s family journey to New Zealand in the sixties is a central theme, offering a multigenerational perspective on the tapestry of life. Drawing from a rich well of experiences, Terence shares stories from his twenty years of service in the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) during the dynamic seventies and eighties. Readers will be treated to tales of mishaps and adventures, providing a captivating insight into an era that shaped the author and the world around him. &#8220;The Tome of Ding&#8221; is more than a compilation of stories; it&#8217;s a celebration of life&#8217;s diverse experiences, an exploration of resilience, and an ode to the enduring spirit of adventure. <\/p>\n<p>About the Author<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nTerence Dingwall, an extraordinary storyteller and adventurer, takes readers on a riveting journey through a life shaped by diverse experiences, chronicled in a series of anecdotes and Bush poetry. Born in the Seychelles and raised during the Colonial era in Kenya amidst the Mau Mau Emergency, Dingwall&#8217;s unique narrative spans continents, encompassing boarding school life in Nakuru, Nairobi Primary, and Prince of Wales High School, eventually leading him to emigrate to New Zealand.<\/p>\n<p>Dingwall&#8217;s journey continued as he joined the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) as an Air Radio technician, embarking on a remarkable 20-year service. Within the pages of his writings, he encapsulates a rich tapestry of adventures, from the rigors of military life to the allure of the open road on his motorcycle. His anecdotes are peppered with madcap inventions and the irreverent humor that has become Dingwall&#8217;s signature. The narrative unfolds as Dingwall invites readers into the grip of the &#8220;Dark Side&#8221; of motorcycling, a theme interwoven with tales of travel and the unpredictable escapades of a life well-lived. His writing reflects not only the thrill of the ride but also the camaraderie, resilience, and misadventures that come with a life dedicated to exploration and unconventional pursuits.<\/p>\n<p>After his service in the RNZAF, Dingwall&#8217;s journey took him to Australia, where he now resides with his partner Susan. Together, they have raised three children who have flown the nest, leaving Dingwall to indulge in his primary passions \u2013 motorcycling and the craft of writing tongue-in-cheek poetry.<\/p>\n<p>When asked about the motivation behind crafting this book, the author said \u201cIt arises from the narratives I heard my parents share about their early years \u2013 tales of star-crossed love, the profound impact of World War II on countless destinies, and the chilling accounts of the Mau Mau threat looming over our family. The closeness we experienced to becoming mere statistics in a Colonial war adds a layer of urgency to preserving these stories. While my mother openly discussed matters of the heart, my father was notably restrained about his wartime experiences. It took years of patient inquiry to extract these memories, a process that evidently took a toll on him, delving into the mentally haunting realm of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a burden borne only by survivors.<\/p>\n<p>I realize that, if I was there, at the right time and place and I had the education provided to me and my siblings through the hard graft of my loving parents, their stories must be kept alive through the medium of writing. Writing is an innate skill for me, effortlessly translating stories into poetic forms. This work stands as my contribution to posterity, an illustration of how one can encapsulate the tales of their own parents. Their stories, inherently, become ours. This book is a symbolic passing of the message stick through time, emphasizing that the responsibility of carrying forward this legacy fall on individuals who pick it up when the previous carrier is unable to pass it on. As you engage with this narrative, reflect on whether you are merely a reader or the torchbearer of this invaluable legacy.<\/p>\n<p>Previously, Terence Dingwall participated in a radio interview with Susan Shirayko, offering insights into his literary journey.
