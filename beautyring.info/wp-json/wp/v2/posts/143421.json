Geogrid is more frequently used as a stabilizing or reinforcing material in civil applications. Geogrid is utilized for soil reinforcement in retaining walls, dams, steep slopes, and other structures. The substance in the pavements of roads, railroads, and other places can be stabilized using it. In order to reduce the chance that the material will be incorporated into a soft subgrade, geogrid can also be used as a separator layer.<\/p>\n<p><b>Download Free Sample Report PDF @ <\/b><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=HHsGBSVxdp3mgMx-rBnk9GUUaSAOzeuFON1Zzi2_M5_mDNQHu8-T-R_5W25ZN9ur3YoV3UeK9u76S57gJHjr6sNbSHe4mLw8lYTcuE3J_ELDdnWSdzgzHeVncljSKNV036trFrMYqdfJqFDtaIKQuGI7cWQX7TDCbIufVwJAESYM7Lu9vwrMoJ-qFyhtVfwfeaquqQrMSsYI9_88GxG7-Q==\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b><u>https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/geogrid-market\/request-sample<\/u><\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Superior Geogrid Characteristics Drive the Global Market<\/b><\/p>\n<p>According to Straits Research, <b><i>\u201c<\/i><\/b><b><i>The global geogrid market size was valued at\u00a0USD 1,200.9 million in 2022.\u00a0It is estimated to reach\u00a0USD 2,785.65 million by 2031,\u00a0growing at a\u00a0CAGR of 9.80%\u00a0during the forecast period (2023\u20132031).<\/i><\/b><b><i>\u201d<\/i><\/b> A key element in the reinforcement or strengthening of the soil is geogrid.

Asia-Pacific accounted for 38.99% of the global geogrid market&#8217;s revenue in 2018 and is expected to maintain its leadership position over the forecast period. Central Asia, Western Asia, Oceania, and Russia have greater infrastructure needs than other regions due to their large landmasses and sparse populations, according to a study on the transport sector by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). Additionally, the demand for high-speed rail transmission networks is growing quickly in South Asia, East Asia, and South-East Asia. The region&#8217;s governments planned and invested significantly in transportation infrastructure projects to sustain the area&#8217;s notable economic growth over the previous ten years. There is anticipated to be an increase in demand for geogrids from the building and road construction sectors over the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p>North America is anticipated to exhibit a CAGR of 9.80% over the forecast period. North America is the second-largest region in terms of the global geogrid market. The demand for geogrid is rising due to the boom in investments in building infrastructures like roads, railroads, and other transportation systems in North America. In addition, the geogrid market in North America came in second with a global market share of 31.0%. As demand for luxurious hotels and buildings rises, geogrid demand in North America is also expected to rise. An increase in investments in construction sectors like railroad stabilization and roadway stabilization to upgrade and expand the existing infrastructure facilities is what is driving the geogrid market in the North American region. <\/p>\n<p><b>Key Highlights<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Based on application, the global geogrid market is divided into road industry, railroad stabilization, and soil reinforcement.
