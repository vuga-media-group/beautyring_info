Mr. Leschly was the highest compensated pharma CEO in the world. The actions of the defendants damage each taxpayer and of course, at the expense of patients.<\/p>\n<p>San Rocco Therapeutics (SRT) is a biotechnology\/biopharmaceutical research company and a worldwide leader in gene therapy. SRT filed the 72-page RICO complaint on Thursday, April 27, 2023. <\/p>\n<p>This RICO filing emanates from a November 2, 2020 settlement in the Supreme Court of New York between bluebird bio, Third Rock Ventures, and SRT. That settlement\/decision confirmed SRT&#8217;s exclusive rights to gene therapy patents, which bluebird bio is infringing.<\/p>\n<p>Misbehavior by pharma executives have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of patients. Recently, the Justice Department settled with the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma for abuses which helped create the opioid epidemic. Richard Sackler was the CEO. <\/p>\n<p>In 2012, the Justice Department levied a 3 billion dollar fine against GlaxoSmithKline for treacherous behavior used during the clinical trials of the antidepressant Paxil. Thousands of adolescents committed suicide. The CEO during the clinical trial process of Paxil was Jan Leschly. <\/p>\n<p>SRT believes that it has a safer gene therapy product that will cost over $2,000,000 less per patient. Recent published data indicates that insulators will make gene therapy vectors safer. SRT hopes that its court actions will result in accessible, safe therapy for patient<\/p>\n<p>There are over 100,000 Sickle Cell Disease patients in the US, a disease that predominantly affects the African American population. Thus, Leschly\u2019s crimes considerably affect ethnic communities. <\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/sanroccotherapeutics.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/2023-04-27_final_Complaint_SRT_v_Leschly_Mass_14_126987.1-C.pdf\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Click here<\/a> for the publicly filed complaint<\/p>\n<p>Case 1:23-cv-10919<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Aurora DeRose<br \/>Boundless Media Inc.<br \/>+1 951-870-0099<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/631639650\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"e_47ho6-3Ts\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Flight of the Rondone by Patrick Girondi book trailer (Trailer created by Megan Euker)\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/e_47ho6-3Ts?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=3Kk4p1JE-NQ43WN5&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" style=\"display:none\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      May 05, 2023, 16:21 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/631639650\/san-rocco-therapeutics-acclaimed-gene-therapy-company-files-civil-rico-lawsuit\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
