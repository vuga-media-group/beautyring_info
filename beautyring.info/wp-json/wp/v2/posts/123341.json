In honor of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/whenradiowasking.net\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Black Music Month<\/a>, we&#8217;re taking a look back at the rich history of black music on the radio, and the pioneering work of music executive, TC Thompkins, who helped bring black music to a larger audience. From the early days of jazz and blues to the rise of R&amp;B, soul, and hip-hop, the radio has played an important role in the growth of the genre. Let&#8217;s explore how the radio shaped the black music landscape and the incredible artists who made it all possible.<\/p>\n<p>The Origins of Black Music in America<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMicheal Jackson, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/sade.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Sade<\/a>, Luther Vandross, Teddy Pendergrass, and countless other Black musicians have made significant contributions to the music industry and American culture. But their path to success was not an easy one. Black music has its roots in the spirituals, work songs, and other musical expressions of enslaved Africans brought to America. Over time, Black musicians developed unique styles and genres such as blues, jazz, and gospel that continue to influence music today.<\/p>\n<p>The Rise of Radio as a Medium for Black Musicians<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMusic executive, TC Thompkins worked with many great artists, but without radio, many of us would<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nhave never heard their music. In his book &#8220;When Radio Was King&#8221;, shares his stories on music having to<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nrely on radio airplay. Radio was a revolutionary new medium that allowed black musicians to reach audiences they had previously been unable to access. The radio played a pivotal role in showcasing black talent to listeners across the country. Many artists who would later become household names, such as Ray Charles and James Brown, got their start on these small radio stations. These early pioneers of black radio paved the way for future generations of musicians to share their stories and connect with listeners around the world. Thanks to radio, the rich history of black music has been preserved and celebrated for decades to come.<\/p>\n<p>The Role of Radio in the Civil Rights Movement<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBlack music has always had a major influence, especially when it came to the civil rights movement. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/michaeljackson.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Michael Jackson<\/a> along with Lionel Richie wrote the charity song \u201cWe Are the World\u201d for famine relief in African countries. Jackson visited Africa numerous times and again Jackson set a new charitable trend to bring charities to many African countries.<\/p>\n<p>In the United States, black musicians and their music were integral to the civil rights movement. The<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nradio played a critical role in this movement by providing a platform for black artists to showcase their<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nmusic and messages. When Radio Was King, a book that explores the history of radio and its impact on popular music offers an in-depth look at this important era. The book covers the period from the 1960s through the 1990s, a time when radio was at its peak and black music was gaining widespread recognition. <\/p>\n<p>Through personal stories, anecdotes, and historical facts, When Radio Was King illuminates the contributions of black musicians to radio and popular music. By exploring the rich history of black music on the radio, we gain a greater appreciation for the important role that music played in the civil rights movement and in shaping American culture. As we celebrate Black Music Month, it is important to recognize the legacy of black musicians and their music and to continue to support and elevate the voices of black artists in all genres. When Radio Was King offers an insightful and informative perspective on this critical period in the history of black music, making it a must-read for anyone interested in music and its impact on society.<\/p>\n<p>How When Radio Was King Sheds Light on the History of Black Music<\/p>\n<p>Key Takeaways and Reflections on the Importance of Black Music Month<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Michele Thompkins<br \/>Thompkins Publishing<br \/>+1 832-451-2170<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/638385195\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/facebook.com\/tcthompkins\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.twitter.com\/tcthompkins\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/linkedin.com\/tcthompkins\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/tcthompkinsllc\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=ee10D7nyCepjT_VE&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      June 09, 2023, 00:06 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/638385195\/exploring-the-rich-history-of-black-music-on-the-radio\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
