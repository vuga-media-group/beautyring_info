As a result, there are more restaurants of all kinds in the area. Additionally, the food service sector in <span class=\"xn-location\">North America<\/span> is anticipated to expand significantly over the course of the forecast period as a result of vendor business strategies like new product launches, partnerships, and others.\u00a0Many quick-service restaurants will expand their operations, thereby contributing to the growth of the market in <span class=\"xn-location\">North America<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><b><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.technavio.com\/talk-to-us?report=IRTNTR74766&amp;type=sample&amp;rfs=epd&amp;src=report&amp;utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=T51-v2_wk22_2023_500_rfs2&amp;utm_content=IRTNTR74766\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">View the sample report<\/a>\u00a0for more key highlights on the regional market share of most of the above-mentioned countries.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Global Market Outlook<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The hospitality real estate market size is expected to increase by <b><span class=\"xn-money\">USD 75.36 billion<\/span><\/b> from 2022\u00a0to 2027, expediting at a <b>\u00a0CAGR of 10.25%<\/b> during the forecast period. The global hospitality real estate market is categorized by Technavio as a subsegment of the global specialized consumer services market, which is a subsegment of the global diversified consumer services market. The parent global specialized consumer services market includes the income produced by the providers of consumer services, such as residential, home security, legal, personal, renovation, and interior design services, as well as consumer auction, wedding, and funeral services.

Fast food chains are being encouraged to grow both domestically and internationally as a result. During the forecast period, the market is anticipated to be driven by urban youth&#8217;s expanding trend of socializing at cafes. The number of quick-service restaurants has increased as more people move into urban areas. Additionally, there are many new restaurants opening in nations like <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">India<\/span>, which will greatly increase the demand for hospitality real estate. <i>By 2023, another 5,000 restaurants are anticipated to open in <span class=\"xn-location\">India<\/span><\/i>, according to the National Restaurant Association of <span class=\"xn-location\">India<\/span> (NRAI).\u00a0Leading coffee shops like Starbucks are opening locations in numerous APAC and South American developing nations. The number of coffee chains that sell items like iced coffee has captured the interest of young people and is expanding its market.<\/li>\n<li>Growing investments by market vendors<\/li>\n<li>Geographical expansion by market vendors<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Hospitality Real Estate Market Challenges<\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><u>Uncertain macroeconomic conditions<\/u>: The industry has been harmed by the US and global economies&#8217; recent periods of moderate to slow growth and uncharacteristic volatility. Since customers may postpone purchases in response to tighter credit, drops in income or asset prices, and unfavorable financial news during the projection period, continued economic uncertainty will have a negative impact on the industry and continue to constitute a risk. This can negatively impact the demand for commercial real estate. Other elements that could impact demand include the state of the non-residential real estate markets, the cost of labor and healthcare, loan availability, and other macroeconomic issues.\u00a0However, the lack of <i>foreign direct investment (FDI)<\/i> and the delay of government subsidies have led to the postponement or cancellation of projects, which has resulted in uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Thus, during the projected period, all of these variables will have a negative effect on the market under consideration.<\/li>\n<li>Uncertainty in construction industry<\/li>\n<li>Risks associated with suppliers\u00a0 \u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Explore the evolving Vendor Landscape<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Some of the market vendors are:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><b>Apple Hospitality REIT Inc. &#8211; <\/b>The company offers hospitality real estate such as Embassy suites, Homewood suites and Springhill suites<\/li>\n<li><b>Best Western International Inc. &#8211;<\/b> The company offers hospitality real estate such as Best Western, Best Western Plus, Best Western Premier, Vib, Glo, Executive Residency by Best Western.<\/li>\n<li><b>Choice Hotels International Inc. &#8211;<\/b> The company offers hospitality real estate such as Radisson Hotels, Rodeway Inn and Comfort Inn.<\/li>\n<li><b>Extended Stay America <\/b>&#8211; The company offers hospitality real estate such as extented stay america suites.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"prntac\"><b>Request a sample today to explore the offerings of vendors and discover how they can benefit your business. &#8211;<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.technavio.com\/talk-to-us?report=IRTNTR74766&amp;type=sample&amp;rfs=epd&amp;src=report&amp;utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=T51-v2_wk22_2023_500_rfs3&amp;utm_content=IRTNTR74766\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"> View Sample Report in minutes<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Key benefits of the report:<\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>This study presents the analytical depiction of the hospitality real estate market along with the current trends and future estimations to determine the imminent investment pockets.<\/li>\n<li>The report presents information related to key drivers, restraints, and opportunities along with a detailed analysis of the hospitality real estate\u00a0market\u00a0share.<\/li>\n<li>The current market is quantitatively analyzed to highlight the\u00a0hospitality real estate\u00a0market growth scenario.<\/li>\n<li>The report provides a detailed\u00a0hospitality real estate\u00a0market analysis depending on competitive intensity and how the competition will take shape in coming years.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"prntac\"><b>Register for a free trial today and gain instant access to 17,000+ market research reports.\u00a0<\/b><b><br class=\"dnr\"><b><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.technavio.com\/request-free-demo?industry=Specialized+Consumer+Services&amp;utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=T51-v2_wk22_2023_500_sub&amp;utm_content=IRTNTR74766\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Technavio&#8217;s SUBSCRIPTION platform<\/a><\/b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Related Reports<\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.technavio.com\/report\/wellness-real-estate-market-industry-analysis?utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=T51-v2_wk22_2023_500_rr1&amp;utm_content=IRTNTR74766\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>Wellness Real Estate Market\u00a0 <\/b><\/a>&#8211; Between 2022 and 2027, the wellness real estate market is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of 21.77%.
