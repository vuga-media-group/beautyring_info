From her trailblazing fashion blog, to her filmmaking and creation of A Shaded View On Fashion film festival (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ashadedviewonfashionfilm.com\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow external sponsored\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\">ASVOFF<\/a>), Diane has woven together several art-forms to create something new and unique - the fashion art film as a new vehicle for designers, filmmakers, and artists to create new means of self-expressions. In the more traditional media, Diane has written for Elle.fr, Vogue.fr, and been a fashion editor for JOYCE, Hong Kong. Diane brings the sort of personal experience and perspective to any in-depth analysis of the fashion world that is unique and unvarnished. Thank you Diane, and we hope to see the entries for ASVOFF 13 for ourselves this Winter! <\/p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">24Fashion TV: Diane, welcome to 24Fashion TV! We have a motto at 24FashionTV: Always be fashion! What does fashion mean to you? Style?<\/strong><\/p><p><em style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">Diane Pernet: Ive been in fashion more than half my life so clearly it means a lot to me however the difference between fashion and style is fashion has a&nbsp;sell out&nbsp;date, that is the nature of fashion. With the current crisis that weve all lived through perhaps that idea might be changing. Style however costs nothing and is timeless. Style cannot be bought.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/531_24Fashion_TV_1984__DP%20in%20CITY%20Magazine%20%20copy%202_1624306636.png\" alt=\"531 24Fashion TV 1984 DP in CITY Magazine copy 2 1624306636 png\"><\/p><h6 class=\"ql-align-center\">Diane Pernet in CITY Magazine, 1984<\/h6><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">Is your personal style, the outfit we so often see you wearing, a nod to Japanese style that you are said to be so fond of?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p><p><em style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">The only nod is to&nbsp;myself. I do love Japanese and Belgian fashion however neither have anything to do with my personal style.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/531_24Fashion_TV_Diane_Pernet%20_%20Vivienne%20Westwood%20by%20Marta%20Lamovsek%20_1624306812.jpg\" alt=\"531 24Fashion TV Diane Pernet Vivienne Westwood by Marta Lamovsek 1624306812 jpg\"><\/p><h6 class=\"ql-align-center\">Diane Pernet and Vivienne Westwood, by Marta Lamovsek<\/h6><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">Do you see a change in the fashion industry from the time of your firstfashion label in the 1980s?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p><p><em style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">Fashion by its very nature is constantly changing. A major change was in the 90s with deconstruction coming from Japan and Belgium afterwards. I dont think there has been a real revolution in fashion since. There is a constant repetition of various eras that go on like a hamster in a wheel. Probably the biggest change is what is happening right now with all the designer collaborations like Balenciaga and Gucci, Dior Homme and&nbsp;Sacai, Valentino and Craig Green and many more to come, I am sure. Kim Jones started that trend years ago with Supreme. In addition, of course there is the focus on sustainability and technology and of course, digital fashion.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/531_24Fashion_TV_Alan_Mikli%20Jean%20Paul%20Gaultier%20before%20ASVOFF%208%20Centre%20Pompidou_1624307120.JPG\" alt=\"531 24Fashion TV Alan Mikli Jean Paul Gaultier before ASVOFF 8 Centre Pompidou 1624307120 JPG\"><\/p><h6 class=\"ql-align-center\">Alan Mikli, Diane Pernet and Jean Paul Gaultier before ASVOFF 8 Centre Pompidou<\/h6><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">You wrote editorial pieces for Elle and Vogueand have been a widely-heard voice in fashion  how big an impact do you feel you made on the style and business of fashion?<\/strong><\/p><p><em style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">That is a question for others to answer, not me. I will say that my opinion is respected.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/531_24Fashion_TV_ASVOFF_at%20Cannes%2011_Rossy%20de%20Palma%20and%20Pam%20Hogg%20my%20DJ_s%20for%20the%20night%20photo%20Konstantinos%20Menelaou%20copy_1624307264.jpg\" alt=\"531 24Fashion TV ASVOFF at Cannes 11 Rossy de Palma and Pam Hogg my DJ s for the night photo Konstantinos Menelaou copy 1624307264 jpg\"><\/p><h6 class=\"ql-align-center\">ASVOFF at Cannes 11 : Rossy de Palma, Pam Hogg and Diane Pernet. Photo by Konstantinos Menelaou.&nbsp;<\/h6><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">Are there trends in recent years that you feel are revolutionary in nature? Do any specific brands or designers come to mind?<\/strong><\/p><p><em style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">As mentioned above: digital fashion, the effect of technology on&nbsp;fashion and of course sustainability. COVID has caused many brands to look inward at the damage that their communications and production are causing on our planet. That is one good thing to come out of this. Most revolutionary designer of the moment is&nbsp;<\/em><em style=\"color: rgb(77, 81, 86);\">Demna&nbsp;Gvatsalia&nbsp;at Balenciaga. In the past it was Maison Martin&nbsp;Margiela. In terms of communication Virgil Abloh also pushes the boundaries with video games like&nbsp;Demna&nbsp;and other ventures into the metaverse as does&nbsp;Alessandro Micheleat&nbsp;Gucci. I think those are the brands that are masters at communication and communication leads the way in this century. I dont know if you call influencers&nbsp;revolutionary&nbsp;but they are the new ambassadors for brands and it seems to be working.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/531_24Fashion_TV_Zoolander_2_1624308582.png\" alt=\"531 24Fashion TV Zoolander 2 1624308582 png\"><\/p><h6 class=\"ql-align-center\">Diane Pernet at the premier of 'Zoolander 2'<\/h6><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">Do you think the fashion business follows standard business cycles or has a periodicity of its own?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p><p><em style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">I think that designers are trying to break out of the normal business cycle. Lets see where that goes and for how long that lasts.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">Your background and accomplishments make you stand out in the world of fashion.How has being a journalist, editor, blogger, documentary filmmaker, and fashion designer given youa unique vision into the business and art of fashion?<\/strong><\/p><p><em style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">Basically,&nbsp;it is a 360 view on the industry. I had my own brand in New York for 13 years with a license in Tokyo, Seibu Department Store, for 5 of those years. I worked as a journalist for Elle.com, had a column called Dr. Diane where I gave styling advice, worked at Vogue.fr when Tina Isaac set up the internet site for Vogue.fr, she had been my editor at Elle.com and took me with her to Vogue.fr. I was a fashion editor for Joyce Ma, the founder of JOYCE in Hong Kong had a magazine which I worked on for 4  years, I was in contact with the buyers however that is the one aspect of fashion that I never experienced. I started the first fashion blog in February 2005 and the first annual, international fashion film festival in 2006, You Wear it Well which changed to ASVOFF in 2008. Ive made documentary short films and am in the BOF 500 Hall of Fame. I have a degree in filmmaking and studied at Parsons and FIT in New York for 9 months. I think if you put all that together, shake it up, you come up with an interesting cocktail that helped to develop my unique vision of fashion that the majority of journalists have not experienced.<\/em><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/531_24Fashion_TV_1985_Neith%20press%20kit%20by%20Zachy26%20copy%202_1624308709.jpg\" alt=\"531 24Fashion TV 1985 Neith press kit by Zachy26 copy 2 1624308709 jpg\"><\/p><h6 class=\"ql-align-center\">Neith Hunter in DP, photo by Zachy Sherif, 1985<\/h6><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">Has the term avant-garde lost or changed in meaning during your time in the fashion industry? Has it lost relevance in a world where style and fashionidealsare massivelydecentralized,and tastes are changing at the speed of light, propelled by social media?I believe you called it fast fashion in the past?<\/strong><\/p><p><em style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">Probably avant-garde does not really exist these days. The term fast fashion is&nbsp;current&nbsp;not from the past.&nbsp;Its a term coined for mass market, cheap prices like how&nbsp;can you&nbsp;buy a t-shirt that costs less than a sandwich and have exercised fair trade. Not possible. That is why there is a demand for transparency that fortunately is something that is gaining momentum.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p><p><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.wasabisys.com\/24fashion\/article_photos\/531_24Fashion_TV_Craig_Green%20in%20Athens%20exhibiting%20his%20first%20collection%20copy_1624309554.jpg\" alt=\"531 24Fashion TV Craig Green in Athens exhibiting his first collection copy 1624309554 jpg\"><\/p><h6 class=\"ql-align-center\">Diane Pernet with Craig Green, exhibiting his first collection <span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">in Athens.<\/span><\/h6><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(32, 31, 30);\">Do you feel closer to cinema or the fashion business?
