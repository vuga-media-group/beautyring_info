The film pays tribute to her nanny, who has worked for her family for over two decades and has played a significant role in the director&#8217;s journey.  As a director, Li is driven to bring to light the tales often overlooked, to breathe life into the quiet stories woven into the complex yet profoundly beautiful fabric of daily life. Set in China in the 1990s, early 2000s, and 2020s in the US, the film is a longer version of the short film idea that Li did in 2017, which eventually led to her acceptance into the Master of Fine Arts program at the University of Southern California.

His commitment to Asian and Asian-American narratives shines through in projects like &#8220;Ella&#8221; and &#8220;B-Side: For Taylor.&#8221; Philips has a high regard for Andy Li&#8217;s unique vision and storytelling audacity, evident in the acclaimed &#8220;After Sunset, Dawn Arrives.&#8221; He sees Andy&#8217;s upcoming &#8220;Auntie Wu&#8221; as a vital addition to the canon of Asian storytelling, showcasing Andy&#8217;s remarkable talent for crafting deeply engaging narratives.<br \/>The film centers around the relationship between a nanny aka Auntie Wu and a girl, Tao Tao, who now live continents apart, but their strong bond and love for each other transcend distance.
