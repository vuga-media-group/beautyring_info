Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and nanotechnologies are propelling the growth of the synthetic data production solutions market. Organizations are leveraging new and developing technologies to establish their presence in the global market and generate additional income opportunities.<\/h2>\n<p>New York, United States, Nov.  29, 2023  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &#8212; Synthetic data generation generates false statistics that appear genuine. It can replicate the original data&#8217;s statistical characteristics, patterns, and relationships in newly generated data instances. It can be used instead of in conjunction with actual data in various situations, particularly when the latter is difficult to obtain, prohibitively expensive, or sensitive. The market for synthetic data production is driven by the rising demand for data privacy, the need for large and diverse datasets for machine learning, and the expanding use of artificial intelligence and data-driven technologies across numerous industries. Industry participants have increased their demand for simulated data in response to the growing popularity of privacy-protection solutions. In addition, the exponential growth of machine learning has transferred the focus to synthetic data. Using AI and machine learning, artificial data can gain access to vast data sets.<\/p>\n<p><b>Download Free Sample Report PDF @ <\/b><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=AP-KJpgqmrR5tVD4UGXYRsSUNrfkwj2mIWKu-k4h-BcrazdSfV-q5mrNnK4MMxhWlPU1MH8LlY84BLAZuRxpgHq-tcpFh8z8OXb8cP89e3nju4bErGe-2rWpXTmz5BYedGXGuQQ325kLvM_uJZYQKfMkkvKMYegc9oL8vgCWz67r1SJ7o1W1f2Iv3p8M8DsBUMUvCEkh8Ntr28qu8MVjvbcrArMdiouRDTJo5fGm81TlOLwuT2IV_1jT9b6-No-s\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b><u>https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/synthetic-data-generation-market\/request-sample<\/u><\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Demand for Data and Compliance Drives the Market Growth<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The GDPR and the CCPA emphasize data protection and compliance. These guidelines mandate that businesses collect, process, and secure personal information. Data exposures have brought to light the need for improved privacy and security. Data intrusions cause financial and reputational harm to businesses. Data breaches may result in fines, consumer mistrust, and legal action. Equifax&#8217;s 2017 data breach compromised 147 million people&#8217;s sensitive information. Equifax ultimately settled numerous lawsuits for USD 700 million. Such incidents highlight the importance of data privacy and the need for businesses to protect sensitive data. Data protection and compliance are gaining importance in the production of synthetic data. <\/p>\n<p>However, data breaches and disclosures of sensitive information cost businesses money. Remediation activities, such as incident response, forensic investigations, notifying affected parties, and enhancing security, require time, money, and resources. These occurrences may hinder the growth and development of the market. According to IBM, the global average cost of data exposure increased by USD 0.11 million to USD 4.35 million in 2022, the highest figure in the report&#8217;s history. A 2.6% increase from USD 4.24 million in 2021 to USD 4.35 million in 2022. This includes incident response expenses, legal fees, regulatory fines, consumer notification, reputational harm, and company loss. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with limited financial resources may be the most negatively affected.<\/p>\n<p><b>Adoption of Advanced Technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) Creates Tremendous Opportunities<\/b><\/p>\n<p>According to Straits Research, <i>\u201cThe global synthetic data generation market size was valued at USD 194.5 million in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 3,400 million by 2031, registering a CAGR of 37.3% during the forecast period (2023-2031).\u201d<\/i> Technology-enhanced methods are assisting businesses in increasing their efficacy. The synthetic data generation solutions market is expanding due to AI, ML, and nanotechnologies. Utilizing new technologies, businesses are expanding globally and increasing revenue.
