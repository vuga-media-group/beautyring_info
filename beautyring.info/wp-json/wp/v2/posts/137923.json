The film not only claimed the coveted Best Picture award but also received the Audience Favorite Award at the DTLA Film Festival, as the sold out Centerpiece film. Furthermore, Micheaux was honored with the Outstanding First Feature Award at the Tallgrass Film Festival, and &#8220;Summer of Violence&#8221; has been nominated for the Narrative Jury Award at the Austin Film Festival.<\/p>\n<p>Nicki Micheaux, a veteran actress celebrated for her outstanding work in television series like &#8220;Lincoln Heights,&#8221; &#8220;In The Dark,&#8221; and &#8220;The Shield,&#8221; has now established herself as a rising talent behind the camera with &#8220;Summer of Violence.&#8221; The film explores the complexities of coming of age in America through the lens of poetry. The screenplay and the poetry are both written by Micheaux.<\/p>\n<p>Micheaux delves into the lives of its characters, revealing their struggles, dreams, and the enduring power of hope while set against a tumultuous time in 1993 Denver with the murder rate at an unprecedented high. She demonstrates exceptional skills for storytelling and directing with this piece. Rod Machen for The Austin Chronicle raves about the film saying: \u201cThis romance lets Micheaux capture something beautiful that rarely makes it onto film. The couple couples, expressing tenderness and intimacy that is hardly ever the province of lovers who are both young and of color. It\u2019s a piece of representation that sets \u201cSummer of Violence\u201d apart from its peers.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The DTLA Film Festival, known for showcasing emerging talent and groundbreaking storytelling, recognized &#8220;Summer of Violence&#8221; as the Best Picture, highlighting Nicki Micheaux&#8217;s exceptional directorial skills and the movie&#8217;s thought-provoking storytelling. Carolyn Schroeder, Director of Programming, states, \u201cThe quality of this year\u2019s entries was stellar, and we\u2019re especially proud of the fact that all three of our showcase films &#8211; Opening Night, Centerpiece and Closing Night &#8211; were by women directors.\u201d Additionally, the Audience Award at the DTLA Film Festival is a testament to the film&#8217;s ability to resonate with a wide range of viewers and evoke powerful emotions.

Brother Jeff Fard, Founder of Brother Jeff\u2019s Cultural Center located in the heart of Denver\u2019s Five Points neighborhood, states, \u201cNaomi\u2019s story is masterfully written and portrayed, along with an exceptional supporting cast that makes seeing Summer of Violence a must. The multiple love stories that emerge in the film proves that love indeed conquers all, including violence.\u201d  The Cultural Center was used as a location for La La\u2019s Lounge in the film. When asked about his experience working with the production, he states, \u201cThe excellence and attention to detail that I witnessed during the filming of Summer of Violence is certainly reflected in the final product of this amazing film.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Nicki Micheaux expresses her gratitude to the DTLA Film Festival, the Tallgrass Film Festival, and the Austin Film Festival for their recognition of &#8220;Summer of Violence.&#8221; Micheaux states,\u201d I am overwhelmed with all of these accolades.
