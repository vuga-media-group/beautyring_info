By declaring himself the conduit to the spirits responsible for natural events beyond their understanding, he becomes the first priest, wielding power, and influence over his tribe. As the patriarch&#8217;s authority grows, he passes on his knowledge and power to his family, who continue the tradition of familial priesthood. Alongside their religious duties, they are taught essential skills such as hunting and warfare, emphasizing the importance of both spiritual and physical prowess.<\/p>\n<p>Reyes expertly weaves a tale of intrigue, power, and belief, exploring the origins of religious practices and the dynamics of authority within early human societies. Through vivid storytelling and meticulous research, he brings to life a world where faith and survival are intertwined, and where the pursuit of power can shape the course of history.<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nJaime Reyes was born in Puerto Rico and relocated to the mainland United States at the age of 8. Following his time in Vietnam, where he served as a Military Intelligence agent and analyst, Reyes embarked on a diverse career path that included owning and selling his own business. Subsequently, he dedicated five years to serving in law enforcement with the Police Department before transitioning to a 25-year tenure as a Deputy Sheriff. Despite his accomplished career in public service, Reyes&#8217; thirst for knowledge and personal growth led him to pursue higher education. Remarkably, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in just two years, a feat accomplished at an age when many are enjoying retirement.<\/p>\n<p>Following his graduation, Reyes embraced his passion for writing on a full-time basis. His latest work, &#8220;The Lazarus Syndrome,&#8221; is a non-fiction exploration featuring case histories of a medical situation where patients are officially declared dead but miraculously resuscitate minutes, hours, or even days later. With a diverse background spanning military service, entrepreneurship, and law enforcement, Reyes brings a wealth of life experience and insight to his writing. Through his work, he aims to captivate readers with compelling narratives that challenge perceptions and inspire curiosity. He is a bilingual author, and his books are available in English and Spanish<\/p>\n<p>The inspiration behind writing this book originated from a school project that sparked a thought-provoking exploration of ancient and modern religions. As a participant in a Statewide School newspaper contest, Jaime penned an essay comparing the mythologies of ancient civilizations such as Greek, Roman, and Norse with contemporary belief systems like Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. This comparative study ignited a curiosity within him, prompting questions about the evolution and endurance of religious beliefs throughout history. He found himself pondering the possibility that just as ancient belief systems faded into obscurity, modern religions could one day face a similar fate. <\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, he was intrigued by the notion that someone, at some point in time, had the foresight to organize and profit from these belief systems, shaping the course of human history. These ideas simmered in his mind for decades, gradually taking shape and gaining momentum. However, it was a serious medical event that served as a catalyst for action. Faced with the uncertainty of his own mortality, he realized that time was of the essence, and he could no longer postpone the writing of this story.<\/p>\n<p>Previous promotional activities include attending several book fairs, participating in the Voyage Media Podcast, and engaging in a radio interview. Recently, Jaime Reyes captivated audiences during an interview on Prime Seven Media Spotlight, where he engaged in an enlightening conversation with Logan Crawford. Offering insightful responses to questions about his book &#8220;In the Beginning: The Early Days of Religious Beliefs&#8221;, his participation in the interview not only showcased his expertise but also provided audiences with a deeper understanding of the ideas that have shaped his compelling narrative.
