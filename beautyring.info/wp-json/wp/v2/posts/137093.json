In addition to the firm&#8217;s experience representing hospitality companies in traditional employment matters, the attorneys advise on a broad array of hospitality issues, including wage and hour and commercial disputes, as well as innkeeper laws involving registration, trespass, privacy and guest disputes. The team also has significant experience handling sales and vendor contract negotiations and disputes, including those involving force majeure and attrition clauses.<\/p>\n<p>Schnitz joins KCO after 22 years overseeing Hyatt&#8217;s legal support for global operations and counseling Hyatt&#8217;s senior leadership team. His experience at Hyatt included supporting the company&#8217;s global sales, human resources, hotel operations, purchasing, risk management and marketing functions. Schnitz also negotiated complex commercial contracts and group sales agreements, handled hotel management agreement disputes, and oversaw Hyatt&#8217;s privacy and labor relations programs.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are delighted to have Rob join our firm and launch our <span class=\"xn-location\">Chicago<\/span> office,&#8221; says <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4028917-1&amp;h=3216584204&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kcozlaw.com%2Fmichael-d-kabat%2F&amp;a=Michael+D.+Kabat\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><span class=\"xn-person\">Michael D.

His clients included hospitality companies, large and small retailers, automobile dealerships and manufacturers.<\/p>\n<p>Schnitz is the 2019 recipient of the Anthony G. Marshall Hospitality Law Award which is presented to an individual who has made pioneering and lasting contributions to the field of hospitality law. He has also taught a class on hospitality law and ethics at <span class=\"xn-org\">DePaul University<\/span> for over a decade. Schnitz previously chaired the General Counsel Committee of the American Hotel and Lodging Association and currently serves as general counsel for the National Domestic Violence Hotline, having previously served on the hotline&#8217;s board of directors for seven years.<\/p>\n<p>Schnitz earned his undergraduate degree from <span class=\"xn-org\">Northwestern University<\/span> and his law degree from <span class=\"xn-org\">Loyola University Chicago<\/span> School of Law.<\/p>\n<p><b><u>ABOUT KABAT, CHAPMAN &amp; OZMER LLP<\/u><\/b><\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4028917-1&amp;h=3299548079&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kcozlaw.com%2F&amp;a=Kabat+Chapman+%26+Ozmer+LLP\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><span class=\"xn-person\">Kabat Chapman<\/span> &amp; Ozmer LLP<\/a>\u00a0(KCO) is a boutique labor and employment, business, and white-collar litigation law firm with offices in <span class=\"xn-location\">Atlanta<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Chicago<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Kansas City<\/span> and Los Angeles.\u00a0KCO represents Fortune 500 companies in class, collective, and representative actions, labor and employment disputes, complex commercial disputes, and white-collar investigations and litigation in jurisdictions across the country.\u00a0KCO also provides consulting services, training, day-to-day advice and conducts internal investigations in all of the areas in which it litigates.
