According to Professor Tamu Chambers of Hudson Valley Community College, \u201cDiversity, equity, and inclusion translate to a better understanding of each other. When someone lives differently than you, talks differently, walks differently, loves differently, believes in God differently, that just means that person has something to give. When we understand that everyone has something to offer, we are more able to respect our differences. We are all special. Understanding and respect are the keys. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are now part of guidelines for employers and schools. \u201cThese guidelines are not about the law; they\u2019re about how we treat each other. Before these guidelines, people took DEI for granted. Now we are trying to help everyone be aware and keep themselves in check so everyone can feel comfortable in the classroom and at work. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re doing a pretty good job,\u201d explains Professor Chambers.<\/p>\n<p>As a UNITE leader, Professor Chambers is working to teach students from different cultures that they\u2019re often not all that different. \u201cWorking with African American and Jewish students is a tremendous opportunity to teach these kids just how much they have in common. Although they look very different on the outside, both groups have a terrible history of segregation, abuse, and torture. Jewish people are contending with Holocaust deniers while African Americans are dealing with people who still feel black people are inferior. I think a lot of people thought our students really don\u2019t care much about anything. Well, we can all see how much students care with all the protests going on for and against what\u2019s happening in Israel,\u201d explains Professor Chambers.<\/p>\n<p>When some people hear about DEI, they\u2019re concerned someone wants to take away their traditions. \u201cToo many think one group wants to take over\u2014that is not the case. Everyone wants to have opportunities, to participate, and that\u2019s what DEI provides. DEI is not about someone coming along taking anything away. This is why education is so important. When you don\u2019t really know, when you don\u2019t understand, the first reaction is self-protection. I\u2019ll be honest,\u201d shares Dr. Chambers, \u201cin the 1960s, I had heard terrible things about the gay community and really didn\u2019t understand. That lack of understanding told me that I had to learn more. I heard about a gay community in Albany that ran support groups out of a private home\u2014everyone could go there for anything. I visited to get a better understanding, and yes, during my first visit, I was nervous! I tell my students, whenever you learn about a new culture, you will often feel nervous.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy fears evaporated when a woman came over, took my hand, and asked, \u2018Oh, are you experimenting?\u2019 and I answered, very quietly, \u2018No.\u2019 Guess what? That was okay! I made some great friends and learned that I really could go in and learn from people who I once feared. Since then, I\u2019ve done the same with so many different groups. And I love it, love it. Education is so important. With understanding, that first fear reaction entirely goes away,\u201d explains Professor Chambers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBeing inclusive absolutely does not mean anyone needs to forget their history and traditions. For example, the push to take Christ out of Christmas. I just do not understand why being inclusive means that we have to take Christ out of Christmas. Being inclusive means we have a richer culture that includes many traditions. With DEI, everyone can celebrate their traditions the way they want while celebrating other traditions. It\u2019s so important that our students study history to get a better understanding,\u201d explains Professor Chambers.<\/p>\n<p>At Hudson Valley Community College, Professor Chambers is happily celebrating as many traditions as possible. \u201cEvery month we have something to celebrate, from St. Patrick\u2019s Day to Black History and Women\u2019s History. I love to dress up, so for me, DEI is a wonderful opportunity to try out new outfits, for example, a jahab for Muslim students. And how much fun is mehndi! All cultures have special days and they\u2019re all fun. If people are willing to at least try new ideas and celebrations, confusion and fear just melt away.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Close Up Radio will feature Tamu Chambers in an interview with Doug Llewelyn on Monday, July 8th at 11 am EST<\/p>\n<p>Listen to the show on <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.blogtalkradio.com\/closeupradio\/2024\/07\/08\/close-up-radio-welcomes-back-tamu-chambers-of-hudson-valley-community-college\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">BlogTalkRadio<\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions for our guest, please call (347) 996-3389<\/p>\n<p>For more information about Tamu Chambers and Hudson Valley Community College, please visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/theprofessorschambers.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/theprofessorschambers.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Lou Ceparano<br \/>Close Up Television &amp; Radio<br \/>+1 631-850-3314<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/725493996\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CloseUpTelevisionandRadio\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=5TqoOt_68pbHUziy&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      July 05, 2024, 21:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/725493996\/tamu-chambers-of-hudson-valley-community-college-to-be-featured-on-close-up-radio\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
