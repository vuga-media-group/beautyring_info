Its close proximity to the airport can lead to unpredictability in the number of diners it serves on any given day, which can lead to overproduction as kitchen staff prepare for service. According to Leanpath data, overproduction is the leading contributor to food waste in foodservice and hospitality kitchens.<\/p>\n<p>Controlling this food waste is important for environmental, social and financial reasons.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sustainability is key,&#8221; says Sheraton Amsterdam Food and Beverage Manager Pim Van Het Reve. &#8220;But it&#8217;s also about how much money we throw into the bin. Over the last year food prices have been rising and I needed another tool to reduce my food cost. That&#8217;s where food waste prevention comes in.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>One-third of the world&#8217;s food production goes to waste every year, with a quarter of that waste coming from the foodservice industry, according to United Nations&#8217; figures. The financial cost of this waste is estimated at <span class=\"xn-money\">$1 trillion<\/span> annually. If food waste were a country, it would rank third in greenhouse gas emissions.<\/p>\n<p>Recognizing this impact, Sheraton Amsterdam partnered with Leanpath, whose food waste tracking devices allow high-production foodservice operations to understand what food is being wasted and why. Leanpath&#8217;s analytics platform identifies high-impact opportunities for food waste reduction and sets automated goals to break a large food waste problem into manageable wins. On average, kitchens cut their food waste in half with Leanpath, leading to significant financial and environmental savings.<\/p>\n<p>This new effort to reduce food waste is in line with other sustainability initiatives the hotel has undertaken. In September, it partnered with a local brewery to produce beer from its excess bread, mainly from its breakfast service. The beer, Gouden Brood, is sold exclusively at the Sheraton Amsterdam.<\/p>\n<p><b>ABOUT LEANPATH<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Leanpath, a Certified B-Corp, is on a mission to make food waste prevention and measurement everyday practice in the world&#8217;s kitchens. With customers in over 45 countries, Leanpath&#8217;s solution identifies root causes of food waste and changes behaviors that lead to that waste. Since 2004, Leanpath and its foodservice partners have prevented 100 million pounds of food from going to waste, an average of 50 percent reduction per kitchen. Leanpath has offices in Portland, <span class=\"xn-location\">London<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Shanghai<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Media Contact:<br class=\"dnr\"><span class=\"xn-person\">Sam Smith<\/span><br class=\"dnr\">971-279-8228<br class=\"dnr\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/cdn-cgi\/l\/email-protection#5162676664626011343c30383d6521237f323e3c\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><span class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"497a7f7e7c7a78092c242820257d393b672a2624\">[email\u00a0protected]<\/span><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>SOURCE Leanpath<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" alt src=\"https:\/\/rt.prnewswire.com\/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH47877&amp;Transmission_Id=202310250836PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH47877&amp;DateId=20231025\" style=\"display:none\">\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Originally published at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/sheraton-amsterdam-launches-leanpath-food-waste-prevention-program-301966718.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener noreferrer sponsored\">https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/sheraton-amsterdam-launches-leanpath-food-waste-prevention-program-301966718.html<\/a><br \/>\n<font size=\"-1\"><em>Images courtesy of <a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/pixabay.com<\/a><\/em><\/font><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>AMSTERDAM, Oct. 25, 2023 \/PRNewswire\/ &#8212; Sheraton Amsterdam Airport Hotel and Conference Center has partnered with technology provider Leanpath in a new effort to reduce its food waste by 50 percent.
