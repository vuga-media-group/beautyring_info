His senior-level leadership communications career spans the corridors of power and influence on both sides of the Atlantic \u2013 as a former speechwriter for top leaders at NATO headquarters in Brussels, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Chancellor of UCLA, senior executives of several Fortune 100 corporations, and as a legislative aide to former Congressman Leon Panetta. <\/p>\n<p>In <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Joy-Public-Speaking-Voice-Potential\/dp\/1736697609\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">The Joy of Public Speaking<\/a>: Find Your Voice and Reach Your Peak Potential, Cossolotto distills many years of high-profile speechwriting and speech coaching experience into a comprehensive, how-to guide to help experienced, novice, and terrified speakers overcome self-defeating attitudes, feelings, and habits about public speaking. <\/p>\n<p>Cossolotto points out that the ability to speak confidently to audiences of all types is a widely recognized leadership and success skill. It&#8217;s also a potent personal empowerment tool. And yet, opinion surveys confirm that most people rank public speaking as one of their top fears, along with spiders, snakes, and death itself. Indeed, the fear of public speaking is reputed to negatively affect roughly 75% of the population. <\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how Cossolotto explains his overall approach to public speaking success and personal empowerment generally: \u201cI believe the most powerful motivational speech in the world is what you say to yourself. Your internal dialog \u2013 your consistent, habitual self-talk \u2013 will determine whether you succeed or fail, whether you reach your peak potential in life or fall short. That\u2019s why I focus my books, coaching, and speaking programs on sharing the tools needed for empowering mindset shifts. My overriding goal is to help my audiences and clients replace negative, disempowering habits of thought with positive, empowering mindsets. This approach applies to all three &#8216;power tools&#8217; in my Triad Empowerment System \u2013 Habits \/ Speaking \/ Promises \u2013 and my trilogy of books on these topics.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Turn Stage Fright into Stage Delight<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nCossolotto&#8217;s inspiring book and PodiumPower! speaking and coaching programs embrace a simple proposition: People who learn to enjoy public speaking tend to be better at it than those hobbled by anxiety, trepidation, or outright terror. He asks readers and audiences to join him as he unveils what he calls \u201cthe gentle art of mental joyjitsu\u201d \u2013 powerful mindset shifts that encourage participants to turn stage fright into stage delight by bringing a natural, authentic joy to every speaking opportunity. Join Matthew as he shares potent mindset shifts, profound insights, and practical tips designed to give your career, your leadership skills, and your self-confidence a big boost. <\/p>\n<p>As part of his speaking and coaching business, Cossolotto recently launched a new website (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.MatthewCossolotto.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.MatthewCossolotto.com<\/a>), complete with a demo video and an overview of his lineup of Personal Empowerment Programs (PEPTalks).
