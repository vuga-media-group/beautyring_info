As this region is rich in mining, refineries, and chemicals, it is anticipated that large-scale construction operations, especially in growing economies such as China and India, will fuel economic growth. Consequently, industrial equipment such as cable glands is anticipated to increase substantially in this region. Exxon Mobil predicts that by 2040, energy demand will exceed 316 quadrillion BTUs. It is anticipated to reach 271 quadrillion BTUs by 2025, raising the need for the investigated market.<\/p>\n<p>Europe is the second largest region. It is estimated to reach an expected value of USD 555 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 5.4%. Europe&#8217;s demand for oil and gas has increased due to the economic recovery, industrial activity, and heating demand brought on by winter cold spells. The region is one of the world&#8217;s most advanced and largest crude oil refiners.
