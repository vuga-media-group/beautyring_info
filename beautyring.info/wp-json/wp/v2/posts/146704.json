The California Density Bonus law is a powerful tool that allows developers to increase the number of units in a project as long as a portion of the building is designated for accessibly priced housing. This law enabled us to increase the ArtHaus Jack London unit count from 102 hotel rooms to 130 entry-level apartments. <span class=\"xn-person\">Riaz Taplin<\/span> emphasized the importance of the California Density Bonus Legislation in the development process &#8220;This legislation empowers developers to contribute to the social fabric of our communities by addressing the housing challenges in our state. ArtHaus Jack London stands as a testament to the positive impact coherent policy can have in creating more housing.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>ArtHaus Jack London is a unique new addition to the <span class=\"xn-location\">Oakland<\/span> cityscape and\u00a0 represents the grit and determination of the city.
