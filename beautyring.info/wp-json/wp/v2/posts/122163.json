The films selected will have their Chicago premiere in this international film festival that, since its inception, presents culturally significant films that explore the Black and Indigenous experience, giving a multidimensional voice to often misrepresented realities and peoples.  <\/p>\n<p>Several films in this year\u2019s festival explore the interaction between immigrants and their surroundings.  In Opening Night film LUDI by Edson Jean (USA) \u2013 sponsored by the DuSable Heritage Association and The Haitian American Museum of Chicago &#8211; we follow Haitian nurse Ludi Alcidor as she embarks on a frantic scour through Miami&#8217;s private care-taking world in an increasingly desperate attempt to send money to her family in Haiti. ANGELS ON DIAMOND STREET by Petr Lom (Netherlands\/USA) follows three African American women fighting for social justice in a black church in Philadelphia with their soup kitchen and their embrace of a family of Mexican refugees.  YAFA, FORGIVENESS by Christian Lara (France\/Guadeloupe) explores the social and economic dynamics at work in the relationship between an African immigrant in Paris and a Caribbean policeman from Guadeloupe as they seek to understand each other.<\/p>\n<p>The program Spotlight on New African Cinema presents the work of two young upcoming African filmmakers: THE AFRICOLOGIST by Valerio Lopes (Cape Verde) is an innovative Afrofuturist documentary that takes us on an exploratory journey into the past, present and future of Africa.  BLIND EYE by Mengameli Nhlabathi (South African) is a thriller that explores the mechanism behind the all too real corruption problems in South African society today. <\/p>\n<p>The program The Magic of the Blues is comprised of two films: Mercurial blues-man Fantastic Negrito faces his demons amidst the mental health crisis ravaging his Oakland community in the dynamic music documentary FANTASTIC NEGRITO: HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND YET? by Francisco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Capriles &amp; Yvan Iturriaga (USA). MUSIC PICTURES: NEW ORLEANS by Ben Chace (USA) gives us legacy portraits and a rare backstage access into the lives and craft of four New Orleans music legends: Irma Thomas &#8211; the reigning \u201cSoul Queen of New Orleans\u201d, Little Freddie King, Ellis Marsalis, and The Trem\u00e9 Brass Band.<\/p>\n<p>ADIFF\u2019s SPOTLIGHT ON MALI presents two films: W\u00d9LU by Daouda Coulibaly is an urgent and vibrant African thriller that follows Ladji (a beautifully understated Ibrahim Koma) who, when he loses out on a job opportunity, is lured into the lucrative but highly dangerous world of drug smuggling. The other film DANCING THE TWIST IN BAMAKO (TWIST \u00c0 BAMAKO) by Robert Gu\u00e9diguian is set in the early 1960s, as Mali\u2019s capital city celebrates the country\u2019s independence from French colonial rule.  The idealistic Samba works toward creating a more just nation by day, and dances to Otis Redding and the Supremes with his spirited girlfriend Lara by night.  For the film\u2019s theatrical run at New York\u2019s Film Forum, New York Times film critic A.O. Scott wrote \u201dThe cast is&#8230; dynamic and sincere in a way that gives the drama a buoyant teen-movie spirit even as it takes a grave turn. It\u2019s affecting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>ADIFF CLOSING NIGHT is MOVE WHEN THE SPIRIT SAYS MOVE: THE LEGACY OF DOROTHY FOREMAN COTTON, an inspiring portrait of Dorothy Foreman Cotton, a courageous and overlooked key player in the Civil Rights Movement, and a bold and highly effective leader who educated thousands in their citizenship rights and inspired generations of activists with her powerful freedom songs. Director\/Producer Deborah C. Hoard and Executive Producer and Senior Advisor Laura Branca will be in attendance for a post screening discussion and reception in celebration of Juneteenth.<\/p>\n<p>For a full schedule and to order advance tickets online please call 773-281-4114 or 212-864-1760 or visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.facets.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">http:\/\/www.facets.org<\/a> or http:\/\/<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nyadiff.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.NYADIFF.org<\/a>.
