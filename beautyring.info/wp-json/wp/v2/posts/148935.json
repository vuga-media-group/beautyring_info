Below is a sampling of how Davidson-operated properties are participating:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><b>The Alexander<\/b> in <span class=\"xn-location\">Indianapolis, Indiana<\/span> will be utilizing fruit peels, its largest food waste, to make assorted flavors of Tepache (fermented fruit beverage made with leftover peels and cores from fruit, water, and sugar). The F&amp;B team will also be turning overripe tomatoes into salsa and gazpacho; processing overripe and excess fruits into jellies and jams for breakfast buffets and restaurants; making chicken stock out of the bones for soup sauces on the line; and donating coffee grounds to local farms to help grow the vegetables used onsite.<\/li>\n<li><b>Islamorada Resort Collection <\/b>in <span class=\"xn-location\">Islamorada, Florida<\/span> is offering leaf to root concepts with monthly seasonal vegetable incorporations to daily specials as well as launching a dog food concept with its pet-friendly dining venues.
