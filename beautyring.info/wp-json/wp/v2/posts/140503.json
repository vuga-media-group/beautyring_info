By showing what each of these inspiring people were like as children, kids can emulate the traits that make them great and realize their own potential.<\/p>\n<p>Incredible things have happened in the last decade \u2013 Brad and Chris have met thousands of fans, read at the White House, collaborated with the heroes themselves (including Temple Grandin, Dolly Parton, Billie Jean King, John Lewis, and Jane Goodall), appeared on major national media, and the series has inspired Halloween costumes every single year. Most importantly, the Ordinary People Change the World series teaches history to this young age group and has keen insight into the current culture wars around history, especially as the world is starving for heroes.<\/p>\n<p>Before Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a legendary Supreme Court Justice, she was a young Jewish girl growing up in Brooklyn, inspired by books, past female trailblazers, and her mother to make the world a better, more just place to be. So even when people turned her away\u2014for being a female and for being Jewish\u2014she never stopped fighting for equal treatment for everyone by pushing back against unjust laws and the beliefs around them. <\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBRAD MELTZER is the Emmy-nominated, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Lightning Rod and twelve other bestselling thrillers. He also writes non-fiction books like The Nazi Conspiracy, and the Ordinary People Change the World kids book series, which inspired the TV show on PBS KIDS, Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to his fiction, Brad is one of the only authors to ever have books on the bestseller list for Non-Fiction, Advice, Children\u2019s Books, and even comic books, for which he won the prestigious Eisner Award.  Brad is also the host of Brad Meltzer\u2019s Decoded on the History Channel, and is responsible for helping find the missing 9\/11 flag with his show, Brad Meltzer\u2019s Lost History.
