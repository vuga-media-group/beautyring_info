Ron Hubbard Achievement Awards Gala<\/a> for Writers and Illustrators of the Future Contests in the genres of Science Fiction and Fantasy held at the Taglyan Cultural Complex in Hollywood, CA.<\/p>\n<p>David Henrickson from Sterling, VA, was named the 2023 Grand Prize Writer Winner, and Dao Vi from Sylmar, CA, who was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, was named the 2023 Illustrator Grand Prize Winner.<\/p>\n<p>David Henrickson said:  \u201cI never imagined I would be here. I\u2019ve loved Science Fiction all of my life. When I was nine years old, I was first inspired by the genre of Science Fiction after reading Andre Norton\u2019s \u2018Star Guard.\u2019  When somebody asks what I do and who I am, I give them an easy answer, \u2018I am an Application Architect,\u2019 that\u2019s what I do, but that\u2019s not who I am. Five years before I retired, I started writing.  I told myself if I could write 100,000 lines of code, I can write a novel. Hopefully, one day we will all be able to pay this forward. Thank you!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Dao Vi said:  \u201cWow! I didn\u2019t believe I was going to win.  I am humbled and honored to be surrounded by so many talented writers and illustrators.  It\u2019s been a huge blessing.  I want to thank Samuel Parr for his wildly provocative story, \u2018The Last History,\u2019 which I illustrated. This award is for you too. Life is what happens when you are having fun. I\u2019m excited to see where this leads for all of us. Thank you very much!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>During the course of the awards show, a Time Capsule from 25 years ago in 1998, was opened by Writers of the Future Judges Kevin J. Anderson and Tim Powers which contained predictions on the Quality of Education in 25 years from famous Science Fiction writers. As it turned out, one prediction from Tim Powers was quite accurate. On October 2, 1998, Tim Powers wrote:  \u201cVoice recognition and transcription programs will have made literacy (all of spelling and most of grammar) obsolete; morality will be discarded as archaic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Winners from this year\u2019s competitions hailed from all over the United States, as well as from Canada, China, Costa Rica, Jamaica, Romania, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.<\/p>\n<p>Joni Labaqui, Director of the Contests for Author Services, Inc., who oversaw the presentations of the Grand Prize Awards, said, \u201cThis year, the theme for our awards show will be Fantasy and Illusion with a motif including a fiery dragon, and Asian pagodas and temples.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Emily Goodwin, Vice President of Public Affairs for Author Services, Inc., served as Event Producer and presented a Lifetime Achievement Award to Dr. Robert J. Sawyer, who penned SciFi and Fantasy classics like \u201cThe Terminal Experiment\u201d and \u201cFlashforward,\u201d who has also served as a Writers of the Future judge since 2005.<\/p>\n<p>During his acceptance speech, Robert J. Sawyer said, \u201cThank you all so very much! Although I entered this Contest when I was starting out, I\u2019ve only ever been on the stage here at the L. Ron Hubbard Presents Writers and Illustrators of the Future Gala as a presenter, never an award recipient. I am thrilled to have finally made it! I thank John Goodwin, Emily Goodwin, Joni Labaqui, and everyone else at Author Services, Inc. from the bottom of my heart\u2014which is beating awfully fast right now!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A capacity crowd of 335 people attended the Black-Tie Gala, which was presented by Author Services, Inc. and Galaxy Press.<\/p>\n<p>An In Memoriam Tribute part of the awards show honored the late multiple New York Times best-selling author, Eric Flint, a Writers of the Future Winner for Volume 9 in 1993, Writer of over 40 novels, Founder and Editor of Jim Baen\u2019s \u201cUniverse,\u201d and Contest Judge.<\/p>\n<p>John Goodwin, President of Galaxy Press, unveiled \u201c<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/galaxypress.com\/writers-of-the-future-volume-39-pre-order-offer\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">L.

Goodwin added: \u201cAccording to United Public Radio Network, this year\u2019s awards show was seen by 340,000 viewers on Roku and was heard by over 1.1 million listeners on the live broadcast.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Keynote Speaker Dan Farr, Founder and CEO of the FanX Salt Lake Comic Convention, said:  \u201cIt is indeed my honor to be speaking to you tonight about something that is near and dear to me. Pop Culture and Pop Culture Conventions. The modern concept of a fan convention dates back to the late 1930s, with various gatherings of a few dozen Science Fiction fans in Philadelphia and New York. Hardcore Science Fiction readers met at these underground affairs, mainly to discuss Science Fiction, which at that time consisted of pulps.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the 60s, fans and culture started to explode, when mainstream TV series and movies such as Star Trek, The Twilight Zone, Lost in Space, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and Forbidden Planet, came onto the convention scene. And with the film industry popularizing characters such as Batman, Spider-Man, The X-Men, the Green Lantern, and about a dozen other superheroes, the convention landscape exploded by leaps and bounds through the 70s, 80s, and 90s.  By the mid-2000s, upwards of 300,000 people would flock to what had truly turned into pop culture conventions that embrace far more than the original buying and selling of comics.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFashion, costumes, characters, dance, film, cyberculture, music, art, literature, television, and radio \u2013 none of it would exist without the writer or the artist creating that script, that picture, that song, that universe. Writing and art have always been and will always be a healing influence. As writers and artists, you carry a large responsibility for the future. Because it is you who carry that powerful torch to unite, while others are trying to tear it down. Do not ever give up on your dreams. As L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Contests, stated:  \u2018The greatest joy there is in life, is creating. Splurge on it!\u2019  Writers and Illustrators, congratulations on your accomplishments, and\u2026keep creating!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Writer\u2019s Contest Coordinating Judge, Jodi Lynn Nye and Emmy Award-winning actress, Nancy Cartwright, announced writer David Henrickson as the 2023 Golden Pen Award winner presenting him a trophy and check for $5,000, for his story, \u201cWhite Elephant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Coordinating Illustrator Contest Judge Echo Chernik and Keynote Speaker Dan Farr announced illustrator Dao Vi as the 2023 Golden Brush Award winner presenting him a trophy and a check for $5,000. Dao Vi illustrated writer Samuel Parr\u2019s story, \u201cThe Last History.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The awards show was held in the visually opulent Grand Ballroom of the Taglyan Cultural Complex, nestled in the heart of Hollywood.

Ron Hubbard created the Writers of the Future Contest (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.writersofthefuture.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.writersofthefuture.com<\/a>) in 1983 to provide a means for aspiring writers of speculative fiction to get that much-needed break. Due to the success of the Writing Contest, the companion Illustrators of the Future Contest was created in 1988.<\/p>\n<p>The annual Contests draw entrants from around the globe and are free to enter. Winners retain full rights to their work, and each is given cash awards. Grand Prize Winners receive an additional $5,000. The Contest flies out all winners to Los Angeles for an expense-paid, weeklong workshop given by Contest judges and culminates in a Black Tie Gala Awards event.<\/p>\n<p>In the 39 years of the Writers of the Future Contest, there have been 547 winners and published finalists. The past winners of the Writing Contest have published 2,000 novels and nearly 6,300 short stories. They have produced 36 New York Times bestsellers, and their works have sold over 60 million copies.<\/p>\n<p>In the 34 years of the Illustrators of the Future Contest, there have been 394 winners. The past winners of the Illustrating Contest have produced over 6,800 illustrations, 390 comic books, graced 700 books and albums with their art, and visually contributed to 68 television shows and 40 major movies. The Writers of the Future Award is the genre\u2019s most prestigious award of its kind and has now become the largest, most successful, and demonstrably most influential vehicle for budding creative talent in the world of speculative fiction. Since its inception, the Writers and Illustrators of the Future contests have produced 39 anthology volumes (with this event) and awarded upwards of $1 million in cash prizes and royalties.  <\/p>\n<p>For more information, please visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.writersofthefuture.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.writersofthefuture.com<\/a> and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.galaxypress.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.galaxypress.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Emily Goodwin<br \/>Author Services, Inc.<br \/>+1 323-466-3310<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/631034327\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/WotFContest\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WotFContest\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/john-goodwin-8b2ab18\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/WOTFContest\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/WritersoftheFuture\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">L.
