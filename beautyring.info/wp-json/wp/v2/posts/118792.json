Levine, author of the very popular memoir INSIDE APARTHEID, transports readers to a South Africa where a family of immigrants puts their resources\u2014and hearts\u2014on the line to end apartheid.<\/p>\n<p>LIV\u2019S SECRETS is a passionately envisaged saga of one fictional South African Jewish family, the Weisz family, immigrants from Eastern Europe. One among a great wave of Jewish immigrants in the latter part of the 19th century, washing up mainly in America, but a wavelet of Lithuanian Jews on South Africa\u2019s shores. <\/p>\n<p>Alongside the Weisz family, other characters inhabit the novel where historical figures interact with the fictional cast amid the background of South Africa\u2019s racial turmoil and apartheid\u2019s authoritarian iron fist. Not least of the characters is South Africa itself. Landscape of astonishing beauty and nature\u2019s abundant flora and fauna.<\/p>\n<p>Decades pass, generations of Weisz family members play out the fully fledged saga\u2014romance, first loves, lust, betrayal, true love, despair and elation, cruelty and evil, hope and fulfilment. In the background the chilling reality of World Wars and escalating racial tensions within South Africa that culminate in the bloody Sharpeville Massacre, March 1960, and its aftermath. <\/p>\n<p>From 1960, the saga pivots on the third generation, embodied by Liv Weisz. Five years earlier, a recent divorcee, passionate and headstrong, she heeds the call to become part of the resistance to the authoritarian White apartheid government. And pays an unimaginable price with resounding consequences for many characters, as the country itself undergoes seismic, racially evoked challenges.  <\/p>\n<p>Reviews are outstanding and the book has already been nominated for multiple awards:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Little fiction exists about Jewish experiences in South Africa.
