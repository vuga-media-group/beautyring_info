Designed to enhance the size and shape of the breasts utilizing the precise placement of silicone or saline breast implants, the procedure is often performed thousands of times across the nation each year. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.teleosplasticsurgery.com\/about\/plastic-surgeon\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Dr. Max Lehfeldt<\/a>, a board-certified plastic surgeon in Pasadena, says it is important for individuals who are considering this procedure to have a thorough understanding about some basic aspects of the breast augmentation treatment process and what can be expected from the results. With that information in mind, Dr. Lehfeldt explains, patients can get a better idea from the outset as to how breast augmentation can help them achieve their goals, as well as how they can prepare for the procedure and the recovery process. <\/p>\n<p>One frequently asked question Dr. Lehfeldt receives from patients interested in breast augmentation regards the candidacy requirements for the procedure, particularly when it comes to age specifications. Some individuals, he notes, wonder if their advanced age may be a factor. In general, if a patient is in good general health and has realistic expectations for the results from the procedure, Dr. Lehfeldt says age is not as much of a determining factor. In other words, one may not be \u201ctoo old\u201d to undergo breast augmentation as long as their present state of health does not increase the risk of surgery. He notes that he has performed breast augmentation quite successfully on many patients who belong to upper age brackets. <\/p>\n<p>Dr. Lehfeldt says patients should also keep in mind the fact that breast augmentation\u2019s benefits are not limited only to size enhancement; shape and proportion can also be positively affected. In fact, he notes, treatment plans should be designed with attention paid to how the breast implants may improve symmetry and balance among the body\u2019s contours overall, in addition to their ability to increase the size of the breasts. During the initial consultation, Dr. Lehfeldt says he discusses a variety of implant options with patients to explain how they can help them achieve their goals while providing results that look both beautiful and natural. He also talks with the patient about the precise implant placement, incision locations, and other aspects of the surgery. In addition, Dr. Lehfeldt can employ state-of-the-art VECTRA<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> 3-D imaging technology during the consultation to provide patients with a simulation of how their breasts may look with specific sizes and shapes. While the image can\u2019t predict final results with 100% accuracy, Dr. Lehfeldt says it can at least give patients a general idea of the possible outcome before they undergo the procedure. <\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Dr. Lehfeldt says it is important for women considering <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.teleosplasticsurgery.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">plastic surgery<\/a> procedures such as breast augmentation to know what to expect during the recovery process. While it differs for each patient, Dr. Lehfeldt notes that most patients should prepare for a minimum of one week\u2019s rest at home following surgery. Swelling and bruising will be present in the treatment areas after breast augmentation; however, Dr. Lehfeldt says these very common side effects should continue to dissipate as the breasts heal. He also cautions patients that, while light walks are encouraged soon after treatment to keep the blood flowing, strenuous activities and exercises that could apply pressure or stimulation to the breasts should be avoided for approximately six to eight weeks. Dr. Lehfeldt notes that patients should be sure to strictly follow all post-operative guidelines and recommendations to help maximize the chances for a smooth recovery. <\/p>\n<p>Finally, Dr. Lehfeldt is often asked about scarring from the breast augmentation procedure. While virtually all surgical procedures will result in scars, Dr. Lehfeldt says advanced suturing techniques and precise placement of incisions can often limit visibility to some extent. Ultimately, this will depend on the surgical technique utilized and where the incisions are placed; however, Dr. Lehfeldt notes that resulting scars usually fade to some degree over time. <\/p>\n<p>According to Dr. Lehfeldt, one of the most important steps in a patient\u2019s breast augmentation journey is to be sure they find a highly-qualified and experienced plastic surgeon to perform the procedure. He says patients should feel confident in their prospective surgeon\u2019s skill and abilities and should feel comfortable in the provider\u2019s overall approach to communication and care. <\/p>\n<p>About Max R.
