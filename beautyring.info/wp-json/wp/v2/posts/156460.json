The market registered a CAGR of 2.30% throughout this period.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Based on the end use, the fertilizer segment is anticipated to register a market share of 91.20% in 2024.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">The markets in the United States and Germany are projected to expand at CAGRs of 2.5% and 3.3%, respectively, from 2024 to 2034.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">Countries like China, India, and Australia are estimated to record healthy CAGRs of 7.4%, 8.7%, and 6.6%, separately, through 2034.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>How is demand for urea formaldehyde faring in the building and construction sector?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The building and construction sector accounted for 18.8% of overall urea formaldehyde sales. Urea formaldehyde is a key component in manufacturing various building materials, it is mainly used in pressed wood products. Pressed wood products are further used in particle board which is used in subflooring, shelving, and cabinetry.<\/p>\n<p>According to the FMI report, in the USA construction industry consumes more than 50% of total urea formaldehyde. Mainly it is used in the residential segment.<\/p>\n<p>Emerging countries are significantly investing in the modernization of infrastructure and new building construction. Owing to the huge economic growth in developing countries and low-interest rates in developed countries the construction sector is growing at a rapid pace.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will increasing demand from agrochemical industry boost up the urea formaldehyde market?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The increasing population is resulting in an increased demand for food, which is directly impacting the agriculture sector. With the growing urbanization &amp; industrialization, arable land is shrinking. Getting the maximum yield from the limited available land is a great challenge. To get the maximum yield, fertilizers are being used to boost production and protect the crop from any harm.<\/p>\n<p>Urea formaldehyde is used in agrochemicals as a nitrogen fertilizer, and it offers a slow release rate and good physical properties. Furthermore, it can also promote the formation of an aggregated soil structure, increasing penetrating power into crop roots, and improving soil permeability.<\/p>\n<p>Slow-release properties of Urea Formaldehyde Fertilizers provide a balanced source of nitrogen to crops and improve the soil structure. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) predicts that by 2050, there may be a 70% rise in global food demand. Hence, a rise in global food consumption might accelerate the market for urea formaldehyde.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Will harmful effects of urea formaldehyde and government regulation be the key reasons for hampering the growth of urea formaldehyde market?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The main disadvantage of urea formaldehyde adhesive in comparison to other thermosetting resins such as polymeric diisocyanate and phenolic formaldehyde is its poor moisture resistance, particularly at high temperatures. Formaldehyde can also be released as a result of the reverse bond-forming processes. Burning feelings in the eyes, nose, and throat, coughing, wheezing, nausea, and skin irritation can all result from exposure to formaldehyde.<\/p>\n<p>According to the National Toxicology Program, formaldehyde is a proven human carcinogen as of 2011. Government restrictions on formaldehyde emissions might slow the market&#8217;s expansion for urea formaldehyde. Emission regulations for formaldehyde from composite wood products are established by the Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act of 2010.<\/p>\n<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a regulation in December 2016 to limit exposure to formaldehyde emissions from specific domestically manufactured or imported wood goods. Due to such regulations, the demand from several end-use industries is getting hampered.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What will be the opportunity for adhesive resins in global urea formaldehyde market?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In the current time period, there is a huge demand for good quality and economically viable adhesives, particularly in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. It is used in many applications, such as building and construction, the manufacturing of automotive parts, the manufacturing of furniture, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>The major demand for good quality adhesives is to substitute the use of fasteners in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and packaging. In the packaging industry, most formulators are relying on good-quality adhesives rather than heavy bolting techniques.<\/p>\n<p>High-quality adhesives are in demand from various end uses such as aerospace, automotive, packaging, furniture, and others. Urea formaldehyde is extensively utilized as an adhesive in these industries due to its chemical &amp; physical properties, also it is less expensive which adds a plus to its usage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reach out to Sales to Secure Your Copy of the Report Now! <\/strong><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=YLhmlX99PTLCKvVPhAecfV4xScDnBzYn4rDKRRpVKicA-L6gRNG-oIGO-69oJ-NidCumL7cmff6JW9BxQh_n9wSWYRD3YDQyJBFIajjH4IOOg-b8pg5UG0r_qj8gNvZZZjuQ36wwJ94Q61g40HXq1MSYvKs-cY_T5U5w51__74A=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.futuremarketinsights.com\/checkout\/576<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Competitive Landscape<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Key players are optimizing for success in the urea formaldehyde market using different growth tactics.
