There will be an encore screening on Saturday, June 10th at 4:00pm.<\/p>\n<p>Emmy Award-winning director Kyle Roberts says, \u201cOur mission for this film is to encourage much needed conversations surrounding mental health told through an adventure lens you can watch with the whole family! We cannot wait to start the journey of this films\u2019 release right here in Oklahoma!\u201d Tragedy ignites a group of teens on a quest to find a legendary landmark hidden in the Oklahoma wilderness. Together, they navigate the quest while confronting the darkness within themselves. This riveting film about mental health was filmed by Oklahomans in Oklahoma with an all-star young cast who are planning to attend the world premiere.<\/p>\n<p>The What Rhymes with Reason all-star young cast includes Gattlin Griffith (The Boys), Ricardo Hurtado (School of Rock), Giselle Torres (The Villains of Valley View), LaRonn Marzett, Katie Burgess, Juan Graterol and Bart Johnson (High School Musical).<\/p>\n<p>Gattlin Griffith, who stars as the anchor of the group, Jesse Brandt, says, \u201cI personally struggle with mental health every day. This story is important, and I\u2019m honored to breathe life into it. The darkness is in all of us but does not have to define us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ricardo Hurtado, who plays Billy Brandt, comments, \u201cOur identity should never be attached to a social following. We are loved by more than our likes; we have a God that loves us unconditionally.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Katie Burgess, who plays Savannah Brandt shares, \u201cI\u2019ve struggled from anxiety since I was 8 years old. I\u2019m so glad that we are finally discussing all of this, because it\u2019s dangerous for kids to feel left alone when they\u2019re dealing with things that feel impossible to overcome.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>LaRonn Marzett, who plays Eli Foster, evokes, \u201cI lost my mom to breast cancer at a young age. That was a major transition through adolescence trying to figure out my own identity without her. It was an honor to breathe life into Eli! Even though my mom is not physically here on earth, I Know she is smiling down on me right now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2018What Rhymes With Reason\u2019 is produced by Kim Dawson (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), Jacob Snovel (Out of Exile) , and Nathan Gardocki (Reagan). Jacob Snovel says, \u201cThe production was truly a dream, and to be able to premiere it with our team that helped breathe life in the film! deadCenter will be a wonderful celebration of the type of heart and talent it takes to make a movie like this that can make such a big difference in people&#8217;s lives. I&#8217;m looking forward to keeping this team together and continuing to partner with the great state of Oklahoma to bring our voices to life on the big screen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The film partnered with Oklahoma\u2019s 988 Mental Health Lifeline to help improve mental health outcomes.
