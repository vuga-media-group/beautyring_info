Any film, including short films, featured within the Festival\u2019s First Nations program automatically qualifies for consideration for the award, with the winner announced at the SFF Closing Night on 16 June.<\/p>\n<p>Sydney Film Festival Chair Darren Dale said, \u201cIt is entirely fitting that the Sydney Film Festival, which for so long has been a champion of First Nations stories and storytellers from around the world, now offers the largest single cash prize for First Nations film, globally. This prize will inspire, motivate and reward established and emerging First Nations filmmakers with the promise that their art is important, is valued and will be seen. This extraordinary award has been made possible thanks to the generous and visionary leadership of Zareh and Ping Nalbandian and we are so grateful for this impactful gift.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Festival Director Nashen Moodley, said, \u201cThe First Nations Award is more than a celebration of unique storytelling; it&#8217;s a crucial investment in the future of Indigenous cinema. By offering this level of support, we hope to encourage more First Nations filmmakers to share their stories, enriching the film industry with diverse perspectives and voices. This award aligns seamlessly with Sydney Film Festival\u2019s long-standing commitment to fostering cultural diversity and amplifying Indigenous narratives.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Zareh Nalbandian, CEO\/Producer Animal Logic Entertainment and Truant Pictures, said, \u201cPing and I are honoured to support the Sydney Film Festival\u2019s First Nations Award through our independent Australian production company Truant Pictures. The Award speaks volumes about SFF\u2019s mission to support global Indigenous voices and support diversity in storytelling.  We are excited to experience the rich tapestry of First Nations films and showcase these stories as part of the Festival in June.  We hope this elevation of Indigenous voices serves as a catalyst for fostering continued dialogue, bridging cultural gaps, and empowering First Nations voices worldwide.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Filmmakers from across Australia and around the world have just weeks to finalise their submissions to become eligible for a record prize pool worth $200,000 at the 71st Sydney Film Festival, including the $60,000 Sydney Film Prize and the world\u2019s largest environment film prize of $40,000 with the Sustainable Future Award. <\/p>\n<p>The entry deadline for all film submissions, including those for the First Nations Award, is 01 March 2024.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nEntries are open to features, documentaries and short films in all categories of the Festival program, including for: <\/p>\n<p>Shorts:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u25cf\tDendy Awards for Australian Short Films, prizes include;<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\no\tThe Dendy Live Action Short Award for best Australian short film ($7,000) and the<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\no\tRouben Mamoulian Award for best Australian short film director ($7,000), both sponsored by Dendy Cinemas, who have supported the Awards for35 years.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\no\tThe Yoram Gross Animation Award for best Australian animated short film ($7,000), supported by Sandra and Guy Gross in memory of the Australian animation producer and director Yoram Gross.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\no\tThe AFTRS Craft Award for demonstrated excellence by a craft practitioner in an Australian short film ($7,000), sponsored by AFTRS.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\no\tThe Event Cinemas Rising Talent Award recognising an emerging short filmmaker who has had no more than five short film credits ($7,000).
