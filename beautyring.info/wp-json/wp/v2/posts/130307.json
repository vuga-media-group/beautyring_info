The one-month pop-up, featuring braids, locs and twists, spanned from July 13 to August 13, marking a notable expansion of the braid bar\u2019s footprint.<\/p>\n<p>The pop-up had one key purpose. \u201cI wanted the Vineyard\u2019s Black residents and vacationers to have easy access to diverse and quality hairstyling options,\u201d said Binta Mamadou, Esq., founder of Visions Braid Bar. <\/p>\n<p>Serving as a fusion of culture, style and summer fun, Visions Braid Bar\u2019s pop-up offered a range of options to children and adults \u2013 from Knotless Braids (a summer favorite!) to Butterfly Locs to loc retwists \u2013 ensuring there was something for everyone, whether you were beach-bound or heading to an elegant soir\u00e9e. The team serviced locals and visitors, including notable personalities. Among them were high-profile figures and celebrities such as the Emmy Award-winning journalist <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/msshaunrobinson\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Shaun Robinson<\/a>, known for co-hosting Access Hollywood and 90 Day Fianc\u00e9. Robinson who received beautiful Knotless Braids adorned with golden hair jewelry enthusiastically took to her Instagram Stories to share her experience with her followers.<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/corimurray\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Cori Murray<\/a>, an award-winning editor and journalist who moderated two panels during Martha\u2019s Vineyard African-American Film Festival, was also serviced during the pop-up. Reflecting on her experience, she shared: \u201cFor years I saw my media colleagues rock gorgeous braids for TV and stage interviews, but I thought that\u2019s not a look for me. However, my go-to style didn\u2019t last long in Martha Vineyard\u2019s humidity and rain. As I hit the stage for my first speaking moment, every curl I had was now gone and my natural hair had swollen into a one-sided afro.\u201d After a friend recommended Visions Braid Bar, Murray spoke with Mamadou who she says answered all her questions and listened to her hesitancy about wearing braids and then \u201cvery lovingly said, \u2018If Michelle Obama can wear braids, any of us can.\u2019\u201d Murray continued, \u201cThat\u2019s all I needed to hear to book my appointment. That night, I walked on stage to moderate the festival\u2019s last panel feeling bold, beautiful and confident. Thank you, Visions Braid Bar, for having the \u2018vision\u2019 of what I could be.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Braids continue to rise in popularity for their versatility, low maintenance and ability to withstand changing weather conditions, making them an excellent option for a summer on the Vineyard. <\/p>\n<p>A unique element of the pop-up is that Visions Braid Bar partnered with the iconic Circuit Style Salon owned by native Islander Seniel Hannagan, located on one of Oak Bluffs\u2019 busiest streets \u2013 Circuit Avenue \u2013 for 12 years. The two salon teams worked seamlessly to serve their clients in a shared space. Through this partnership, \u201cour teams were able to observe and learn about each other\u2019s services while simultaneously providing amazing services to our clients,\u201d said Hannagan. <\/p>\n<p>About Visions Braid Bar: Established in 2020, Visions Braid Bar has solidified a reputation for its commitment to excellence. Guided by Founder Binta Mamadou\u2019s two decades of work in the public and private sectors, including nearly a decade as a practicing attorney, Visions Braid Bar is redefining the traditional braiding experience by introducing a structured approach to offering natural hair services.<\/p>\n<p>For more information, do not hesitate to contact the PR Team at info@visionsbraidbar.com or 301-941-4247 or <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.visionsbraidbar.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.visionsbraidbar.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">PR Team<br \/>Visions Braid Bar<br \/>+1 301-941-4247<br \/>info@visionsbraidbar.com<br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/myvisionsbraidbar\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/visionsbraidbar\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/visionsbraidbar\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@visionsbraidbar\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">TikTok<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=51oyhZ5S9xXdqzZL&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      <span>PR Team, Visions Braid Bar<\/span>\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      August 28, 2023, 10:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/651563518\/martha-s-vineyard-buzzes-with-braids-locs-and-twists\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
