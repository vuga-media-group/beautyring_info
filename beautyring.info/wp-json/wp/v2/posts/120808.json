As a piece of not only Cerruti history, but Italian history itself, we hope to see this environment inspire and influence its next owner for years to come.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Steeped in heritage and history, the bespoke estate offers the opportunity to take up the mantle of a truly timeless provenance. Three structures occupy this expansive, nearly 19-acre property in the Italian Alps, a famed get-away destination for Hollywood celebrities like Roman Polanski, Michael Douglas, and Jack Nicholson. From the nearly 200-year-old primary residence to the contemporary guest house to a cozy caretaker\u2019s cottage, guests can enjoy a private retreat. The estate is ideal for large family gatherings or hosting friends. Enjoy the breathtaking views of expansive peaks in the distance from the multiple terraces. With on-property wine production capability, a quality glass of vino is always at hand. Idyllic fruit orchards and rose gardens dot the span of the grounds, adding to the distinct essence and historic allure the House of Cerruti has to offer. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are honored to represent this exquisite property which holds such a story of Italian culture at its core,\u201d stated Lodovico Pignatti Morano, managing partner at Italy Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. \u201cAs a fashion icon worldwide, we felt Mr. Cerruti\u2019s legacy should be treated as such. We are pleased to be working in cooperation with Sotheby\u2019s Concierge Auctions to bring a global audiences\u2019 attention to this irreplaceable piece of history where the genius of Nino Cerruti originated, and we look forward to naming the next owner.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As a renowned Italian fashion designer, Nino Cerruti has left an indelible mark on the luxury industry. A giant among Italian entrepreneurs, he is known for creating iconic designs using innovative fabrics like wool crepe, which has become a signature of his brand. Often described as \u201ca man of elegance,\u201d or \u201cthe most elegant man in the room,\u201d Cerruti boasts an inventive portfolio of accomplishments, having pioneered men\u2019s ready-to-wear fashion and the invention of casual chic and gender fluid wear.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1960s, Cerruti crossed paths with Giorgio Armani, hiring him as a creator of men\u2019s fashion, together making a profound mark on the world of fashion before Armani branched out on his own. Cerruti&#8217;s foray into luxury branding began in the 1970s when he launched his first perfume line. His brand, Cerruti 1881, has since expanded to include a range of luxury goods, including watches, leather goods, and eyewear\u2014as part of the impressive brand portfolio, this also includes the 1996 designs of the wedding for Carolyn Bessette\u2019s wedding to John F. Kennedy Jr. Cerruti has forged a name for himself across Hollywood, designing costumes for blockbusters like Pretty Woman, American Psycho, and Air Force One, and clothing A-listers during the 80s and 90s, such as the likes of Sharon Stone, Anthony Hopkins, Roman Polanski, Michael Douglas, Jack Nicholson, and more. In 1994, Cerruti also made waves in the Formula 1 motorsport as the official designer of Ferrari, with designs worn by seven-time World Champion, Michael Shumacher. Today, Cerruti is considered one of the most influential fashion designers of his generation and continues to inspire a new generation of designers.<\/p>\n<p>As for his former home, it awaits its next owner to forge a new chapter. If the home itself is not exquisite enough, its location at the foot of the Alps is infused with Italian culture. The House of Cerruti is set just outside of Biella, an area rich in culture, food, majestic nature, outdoor adventure, and world-renowned for its textiles industry. On the border with France and Switzerland, Piedmont is a region of Baroque architecture, rolling vineyards, and elegant cuisine. Home to creatives and innovative minds, Biella is truly the heart of \u201cMade in Italy\u201d fashion. Relish locally grown and produced products such as white truffles, world-famous Nebbiolo wines, or hazelnuts. Ski the Italian Alps in the shadow of Mont Blanc, as Courmayeur and Monterosa are just 90 minutes away. Spend long summer days on Lake Como and Lakes Orta and Maggiore. Further afield, luscious seafood and Mediterranean beaches await on the Ligurian Coast, just two-hours from the estate. For transcendence-seekers, the UNESCO-recognized Sanctuary di Oropa is a religious pilgrimage site in the Biellese Alps. Well-connected to Milan and Turin, Beilla is convenient to reach via train or car.<\/p>\n<p>House of Cerruti is available for showings daily 1-4PM and by appointment, in person or virtually.<\/p>\n<p>As part of Concierge Auctions&#8217; Key for Key<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> giving program in partnership with Giveback Homes, the closing will result in the funding towards a new home built for a family in need.<\/p>\n<p>Agents will be compensated according to the terms and conditions of the Listing Agreement.
