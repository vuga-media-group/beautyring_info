It is made of polystyrene resin and other additives that are melted and then forced through a shaping die, resulting in a continuous sheet of closed-cell foam insulation. To encourage the use of energy-efficient insulation systems, governments around the world are enforcing strict building codes and regulations. Extruded polystyrene insulation materials are in high demand due to the increase in construction activity, particularly in the commercial sector and the rising demand for energy-efficient buildings.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">The U.S. is a technological innovation leader, there is an increased demand for new and modern infrastructure, such as data centers, research facilities, and other specialized buildings. The U.S. government has implemented energy efficiency regulations and codes to reduce energy consumption in buildings. Extruded polystyrene insulation material is an effective way to meet these standards while also helping reduce energy consumption, which is opening new market opportunities.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">Extruded polystyrene insulation is a versatile material that can be used in a wide range of non-residential applications including roofs, walls, and floors. It is also simple to work with and can be cut to size and shape, making it an appealing option for builders looking for an easy-to-install material. Several factors are driving this trend, including the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, comply with energy efficiency regulations, and lower operating costs.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">Many building codes and energy efficiency standards now mandate the use of R-value or U-factor rated insulation materials. XPS insulation can assist non-residential building owners in meeting these requirements, making it an appealing option for those seeking to comply with building codes and regulations. In addition, extruded polystyrene insulation material has durability, sustainability, versatility, and fire resistance property.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">However, extruded polystyrene insulation materials typically have a lower R-value than other types of foam insulation, such as polyurethane foam. This means that it may not provide as much insulation in the same thickness of the material. XPS insulation materials are less permeable than other types of foam insulation, which means they may not allow moisture to escape as easily from a building. This can result in moisture buildup and mold growth. XPS insulation materials are made from petroleum-based materials, their production can have a negative impact on the environment.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">Furthermore, they are not biodegradable and can remain in the environment for an extended period of time. This reason makes the use of other alternatives that are available for these types of extruded polystyrene insulation materials. Handling and storage of the extruded polystyrene must be appropriate, XPS insulation materials are flammable and can release toxic fumes when burned and they may not be suitable for certain applications. XPS insulation materials can be more expensive than other types of foam insulation, which can be a restraint for some building projects. All these factors allow consumers to choose alternatives over extruded polystyrene insulation material that hamper the market growth.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><b>Report <\/b><b>C<\/b><b>overage &amp;
