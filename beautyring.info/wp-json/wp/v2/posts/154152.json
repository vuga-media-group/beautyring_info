With this latest work, the veteran composer blends traditional instrumentation and ambient vocalizations with the spacious textures that defined his previous work to capture both the beauty of the natural world and the urgency of its threat. A serene video supports the album.<\/p>\n<p>Still Time is available digitally on your platform of choice: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/orcd.co\/still-time\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/orcd.co\/still-time<\/a> and at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/sverreknutjohansen-spm.bandcamp.com\/album\/still-time\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Bandcamp<\/a>.   <\/p>\n<p>In a departure from his musical interest in the space thematic, Johansen gets more grounded with Still Time. He uses human voices throughout the album to represent a warning of extinction, and ties each track to spectacular imagery by African wildlife photographer <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sollylevi.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Solly Levi<\/a>. The photographs were taken in nature reserves including The Etosha National Park, Namib-Naukluft National Park, and the Masai Mara National Reserve in Namibia and in Kenya. <\/p>\n<p>Joining imagery and sound, the effect is stunning on opener \u201cMassive Extinction,\u201d which begins with a rich and rumbling texture, the sound of wind through a wasteland. Then, a lamenting vocal melody floats over a building dirge of noise\u2014the unstoppable tide of turmoil rising below its heralding hymn, until even that last voice falls silent. Yet the title track \u201cStill Time (Saving Our Planet)\u201d paints a picture of beauty rather than one of devastation. Here, glittering glockenspiels dance over rattles and trills, a quiet scene of insects flitting through a forest clearing, before a cinematic drumbeat erupts with heroic grandeur. And \u201cRhinoceros on Large Salt Pan\u201d is complex yet serene, its warm chords shimmering like sunlight on sand dunes. Throughout this is a soundtrack of immense consideration and imagination.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Desert Elephants of Namibia\u201d features sounds depicting elephants created with the Sequential Prophet X hybrid synthesizer, used like brass over a marching drumline and orchestral trills before the piece climaxes in an accelerando of dissonant strings. Johansen again returns to this synth for realizing the sounds of flamingos on the ethereal \u201cThe Golden Flamingo Lake.\u201d The album\u2019s finale \u201cCheetah\u2019s Realm (At the Masai Mara National Reserve)\u201d captures all the Still Time sounds in one epic seven-minute journey, building from a yearning piano intro into a stunning climax of polyrhythmic drums and desert-wide textures. Then, the piano refrain returns to beckon one final climax\u2014a subtle IDM beat anchoring clattering tribal drums and yearning textures in a gripping harmony. <\/p>\n<p>Still Time is both urgent and hopeful, blending a myriad of organic and inorganic sounds to capture both the beauty of the natural world and the dire imminence of its destruction. But with this sense of urgency, Johansen\u2019s stunning cinematic crescendos come both plea and warning\u2014a call to save our fellow creatures and earth while we still can. Yet even in moments of darkness, Johansen leaves the listener with a sense of hope, imploring us that &#8220;there is still time to turn this around.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Still Time is Sverre\u2019s seventh release on the Spotted Peccary Music Label. His previous releases are Metahuman (SPM-3006), Dreams Beyond (SPM-3005), Precambrian (SPM-3004), The Vast Expanse (SPM-3003), Secret Space Program (SPM-3002), and Earth From Above (SPM-3001). <\/p>\n<p>All of the music has been composed and Produced by Sverre Knut Johansen at Space Center Music Productions in Sandane, Norway in 2022.
