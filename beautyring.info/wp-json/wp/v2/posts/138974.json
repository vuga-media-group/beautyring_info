While Morrie is most-famous for being the beloved subject of \u201cTuesdays with Morrie\u201d, his age-casting definition and advice tips for ignoring ageism are even more relevant today with film and TV industry award nominations for six 65+ actors, including Meryl Streep (74) and Robert De Niro (80). <\/p>\n<p>Rob found Morrie Schwartz\u2019s book draft for \u201cThe Wisdom of Morrie\u201d in a desk after his father passed at age 78 from ALS in 1995. \u201cThe Wisdom of Morrie\u201d was written from 1989-1992 (age 72-75), and finally published in 2023 with these timely tips for how to live vibrantly at any age. <\/p>\n<p>Morrie\u2019s Son\/Editor Rob Schwartz explains, \u201cMy father first defined \u2018age-casting\u2019 and his advice tips for how to <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/show\/the-wisdom-of-morrie-offers-insights-on-living-and-aging-joyfully\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">ignore ageism<\/a> after being forced to retire at age 70 from Brandeis University. Morrie took a concept from the film world to create a term to illustrate his thinking on society&#8217;s problems about aging. The term \u2018age-casting\u2019 is Morrie&#8217;s creation, and is derived from the phrase type-casting, where an actor is limited to one type of role for some reason.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With 1 in 6 Americans now 65+ in the U.S. (2020 Census), the majority in this age group are not ready to retire and be cast aside. With decades of experience, this 65+ group has many skills, talents and contributions that should be valued and shared by society. <\/p>\n<p>After living in Asia for many years for work, Rob Schwartz adds, \u201cThis age-casting phenomenon is truly an American issue, and is unlike what you see in many societies around the world who honor and cherish their elderly.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rob expands, \u201cMorrie&#8217;s coinage of the term \u2018age-casting\u2019 is the way society tries to relegate seniors to meaningless or sidelined roles because of their age. Morrie thought this was stunningly wrongheaded and wastes the valuable experiences aging people bring to the world. Morrie was so perceptive in thinking about society that he created this phrase more than more than 30 years ago. We&#8217;re just coming to understand now that we need to combat this detrimental way of categorizing people. The term age-casting can help us understand people&#8217;s potential should not be limited by external factors.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The six 65+ actors recognized with 2024 Golden Globe Awards Nominations this week include: Annette Bening (65), \u201cNyad\u201d, Willem Dafoe (68), \u201cPoor Things\u201d, Robert De Niro (80), \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d, Helen Mirren (78), \u201c1923\u201d, Steve Martin (78), \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d, and Meryl Streep (74), \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d. Meryl Streep also breaks the ageism ceiling by becoming the \u201cMost Nominated Actor in Golden Globes History\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>When asked to describe Morrie&#8217;s new book, \u201cThe Wisdom of Morrie\u201d, Rob explains, &#8220;Dad wrote about the myth of ageism that once you get old, you can&#8217;t do anything\u2026.He says you need to break out of the age-casting (preconceived notions of what an aging person is supposed to be) and do whatever you want to do\u2026Morrie never thought of himself as an elderly person, but felt society viewed him that way.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>FULL LIST &#8211; 2024 Golden Globe Awards Nominations &#8211; 121123<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/people.com\/golden-globes-2024-nominations-see-the-full-list-8411587\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/people.com\/golden-globes-2024-nominations-see-the-full-list-8411587<\/a><\/p>\n<p>WHERE TO BUY THE BOOK<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cThe Wisdom of Morrie: Living and Aging Creatively and Joyfully\u201d (2023)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAmazon<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Wisdom-Morrie-Living-Creatively-Joyfully\/dp\/B0C1TWT6P4\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Wisdom-Morrie-Living-Creatively-Joyfully\/dp\/B0C1TWT6P4<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBarnes and Noble<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/w\/the-wisdom-of-morrie-morrie-schwartz\/1142260141\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/w\/the-wisdom-of-morrie-morrie-schwartz\/1142260141<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBookshop.org<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/bookshop.org\/p\/books\/the-wisdom-of-morrie-living-and-aging-creatively-and-joyfully\/18910497?ean=9798200813452%20\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/bookshop.org\/p\/books\/the-wisdom-of-morrie-living-and-aging-creatively-and-joyfully\/18910497?ean=9798200813452%20<\/a><\/p>\n<p>ABOUT THE AUTHORS<\/p>\n<p>MORRIE SCHWARTZ (Dec 1916- Nov 1995, passed from ALS at age 78), the beloved subject of the classic, multimillion-copy number one bestseller &#8220;Tuesdays with Morrie&#8221; by Mitch Albom, posthumously releases a new book with his Son\/Editor Rob Schwartz called &#8220;The Wisdom of Morrie&#8221; (April 2023). In the book, Morrie explores life questions in a profound, poetic, and poignant masterpiece of living and aging joyfully and creatively. Later life can be filled with many challenges, but it can also be one of the most beautiful and rewarding passages in anyone\u2019s lifetime. In &#8220;The Wisdom of Morrie&#8221;, the author draws on his experiences as a social psychologist, teacher, father, friend, and role model to offer us a road map to navigate our futures. He was a professor of Sociology and Social Psychology for 30+ years at Brandeis University in Massachusetts, before retiring at age 70. Morrie wrote on a variety of topics. His groundbreaking 1954 book (with Alfred Stanton), \u201cThe Mental Hospital\u201d, made him a superstar in psychology and helped him earn a full-time professorship as his first university position. Morrie was dedicated to social justice and valuing human beings.<\/p>\n<p>ROB SCHWARTZ (Los Angeles, CA \u2013 from the Boston area) is an Award-Winning Music\/Film Producer, journalist and entrepreneur with 20+ years of entertainment experience.
