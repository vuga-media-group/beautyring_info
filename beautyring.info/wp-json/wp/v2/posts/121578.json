For decades there has been a gap in achieving gender and racioethnic equity in the workplace. This has been particularly challenging for BIPOC women. Co-authors of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/store.hbr.org\/product\/shared-sisterhood-how-to-take-collective-action-for-racial-and-gender-equity-at-work\/10540\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Shared Sisterhood<\/a>: How to Take Collective Action for Racial and Gender Equity at Work, Dr. Tina Opie and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/bethalivingston.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Dr. Beth Livingston<\/a>, magnify this topic and break down how the bridging of differences can help make the world a fairer, more just place.<\/p>\n<p>Shared Sisterhood is a philosophy that embraces authentic connection and collective action. It is built on three practices \u2014 dig, bridge, and advance, which is how the two co-authors fostered their relationship. The book also elaborates on their story and combines history to social sciences to provide an action-packed guide on how individuals and organizations can move life and humanity forward. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cBuilding bridges between different communities has always been my life\u2019s purpose, and Shared Sisterhood has been an opportunity to not only further this but to also build on this in my personal life,\u201d said Dr. Tina Opie. \u201cIn the past, I\u2019ve found myself questioning why more hasn\u2019t been done to bond us as Black and White women. Through research I\u2019ve come to learn that is historically rooted in a lack of trust and in order to change that we first must establish trust and understanding with one another. That is where Shared Sisterhood begins.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/leanin.org\/women-in-the-workplace\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Women in the Workforce<\/a> report from LeanIn.Org and McKinsey &amp; Company, women are in the midst of a \u201cGreat Breakup\u201d as record numbers of women leave their corporate jobs, emphasizing the need for change. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cImpact can only exist when we are vulnerable with ourselves and others. That is when the strongest of bonds can be created and what the core of Shared Sisterhood is. It is not just having a friend, but it is about building a relationship,\u201d said Dr. Beth Livingston. \u201cIt is about equal justice and in order to do that, we must include everyone in the conversation, regardless of gender. For it is through these relationships and the empathy and understanding that is established where we begin to create opportunities for women.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For more information on Shared Sisterhood, the authors and to order a copy of the book, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.drtinaopie.com\/sharedsisterhoodbook\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.drtinaopie.com\/sharedsisterhoodbook<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>ABOUT SHARED SISTERHOOD<\/p>\n<p>Gender equity can&#8217;t happen without racial equity. We need Shared Sisterhood.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBias persists in organizations and society. Despite efforts that have been made in the last few decades, gender and racioethnic equity still hasn&#8217;t been achieved. What&#8217;s worse, Black, Indigenous, Asian, and Latina women are being held back more than their White counterparts.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nProfessor Tina Opie first started Shared Sisterhood as a movement to drive gender and racial equity in organizations. Since then, she and professor Beth A. Livingston have worked together to spread the word to leaders across organizations, with thousands of followers joining the cause. In this book, they explain how to use vulnerability, trust, empathy, and risk-taking to build Shared Sisterhood and break down three key parts of the process:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n1. Dig into your own assumptions around racioethnicity, gender, and power<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n2. Bridge the divide between women of all backgrounds through authentic relationships<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n3. Advance all women across the organization and beyond<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBalancing a mix of history, research, and real-life examples\u2014including the authors&#8217; own experiences\u2014this book encourages everyone to join Shared Sisterhood and advance equity for all.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT DR.
