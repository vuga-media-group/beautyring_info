Character dining, gingerbread decorating,\u00a0scavenger hunts and holiday craft workshops add to the yuletide celebrations.<\/p>\n<p><b><u>Freeze the Day \u2013 with &#8216;ICE!&#8217;<\/u><\/b><\/p>\n<p>For more than a month, Gaylord Hotels across <span class=\"xn-location\">the United States<\/span> resembled Santa&#8217;s toy factory as master ice carvers \u2013 busy as St. Nick&#8217;s elves in their wintry workshop \u2013 created Gaylord Hotels&#8217; signature attraction, &#8220;ICE!,&#8221; by carving more than 10 million pounds of ice into classic scenes from holiday films.<\/p>\n<p>An annual tradition at the brand&#8217;s five resorts, &#8220;ICE!&#8221; is a 20,000-square-foot, walk-through attraction featuring eye-popping scenes from classic films, completely made of ice. The 9-degree, arctic experiences are created by a team of 200 international ice artisans.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last five weeks, artisans at each resort hand-carved &#8220;ICE!&#8221; attractions that retell\u00a0the stories of <i>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<\/i> (Gaylord National), The Polar Express (Gaylord Opryland), A Charlie Brown Christmas (Gaylord Palms), A Christmas Story (Gaylord Rockies) and Dr. Seuss&#8217; How The Grinch Stole Christmas! (Gaylord Texan).<\/p>\n<p>Carvers followed design books that outlined every detail of each film&#8217;s characters. Using chainsaws, chisels, grinders and even homemade hand tools, artisans created each attraction in stunning detail from giant blocks of ice. The spectrum of ice coloring, created by a chemist using a proprietary formula, is carefully mixed to maintain its vivid hues the entire holiday season. Lighting designers help create dramatic show vignettes using spotlights, accent lighting, colorful projections and LED lights frozen into sculptures.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;ICE!&#8221; made its debut in 2001 at Gaylord Opryland Resort and has since expanded to all five Gaylord Hotels. An annual fan favorite, &#8220;ICE!&#8221; is the most popular attraction annually at each resort.<\/p>\n<p>This year, guests will be able to experience these holiday classics at Gaylord Hotels:<\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><b>ICE! featuring Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<\/b> <b>at Gaylord National, <span class=\"xn-chron\">Nov. 19-Dec. 31, 2023<\/span> <\/b>\u2013 Guests enjoy favorite scenes from the classic, <i>Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<\/i>, brought to life in this colorful winter wonderland.<\/li>\n<li><b>ICE! featuring Warner Bros.&#8217; The Polar Express at Gaylord Opryland, <span class=\"xn-chron\">Nov. 10<\/span>, 2023-Jan. 1-2024<\/b> \u2013 Based on the beloved Warner Bros. film, families are invited to take a journey of imagination through this heartwarming story as a young child embarks on a magical adventure to the North Pole.<\/li>\n<li><b>ICE! featuring A Charlie Brown Christmas at Gaylord Palms, <span class=\"xn-chron\">Nov. 17<\/span>, 2023-<span class=\"xn-chron\">Jan. 3, 2024<\/span><\/b> \u2013 Guests will follow <span class=\"xn-person\">Charlie Brown<\/span> as he rediscovers the meaning of Christmas, alongside Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, and the rest of the Peanuts gang.<\/li>\n<li><b>ICE! featuring Warner Bros.&#8217; A Christmas Story at Gaylord Rockies, <span class=\"xn-chron\">Nov. 17<\/span>, 2023-Jan. 1-2024<\/b> \u2013 Based on the Warner Bros. perennial holiday classic, guests join <span class=\"xn-person\">Ralphie Parker<\/span> as he dreams of the perfect Christmas present, and later discovers the real meaning of Christmas happiness.<\/li>\n<li><b>ICE! featuring Dr. Seuss&#8217; How the Grinch Stole Christmas! at Gaylord Texan, <span class=\"xn-chron\">Nov. 10-Dec. 31, 2023<\/span><\/b> \u2013 Showcasing the 1957 Dr. Seuss classic, families are invited to experience iconic scenes such as the Grinch lurking through the chimneys of the Who-ville homes, and the Grinch&#8217;s heart growing three sizes after realizing Christmas means a little bit more.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b><u>There&#8217;s Snow Much More!<\/u><\/b><\/p>\n<p>Alongside &#8220;ICE!,&#8221; Gaylord Hotels guests are invited to enjoy an exciting lineup of holiday events.
