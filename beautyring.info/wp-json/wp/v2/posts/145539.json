Moreover, urbanization and increasingly hectic work lifestyle are expected to continue to foster the demand for the market during the analysis period.<\/p>\n<p>Destination spa has also gained considerable popularity owing to rise in demand for traditional spas such as Ayurveda, Swedish, and Turkish massage.
