Sands&#8217; investment in these areas recognizes the vital need to address the impact of the situations NPHY&#8217;s clients face, build self-esteem and confidence, and put youth on a course not just to survive, but to thrive.<\/p>\n<p>Sands&#8217; contribution also is assisting NPHY in addressing its youth clients&#8217; immediate needs for food, hygiene items, clothing, transportation, health care and educational materials, while providing general support for NPHY&#8217;s emergency services touch points including the Safe Place program, the NPHY Drop-In Center, the Emergency Shelter program and ongoing youth outreach efforts. Integral to these operations is funding to support an additional staff person to enhance program delivery.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, Sands and NPHY recently announced their continued partnership to co-present the Southern Nevada Youth Homelessness Summit, which NPHY and Sands have hosted annually since 2017. Sands&#8217; support\u00a0is enabling NPHY to expand the Summit and The Movement to End Youth Homelessness statewide and continue holding advocacy trainings through The Movement Institute, which was launched at Summit 2022.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For nearly 10 years, Sands has been one of our most committed partners, profoundly impacting\u00a0the trajectory of our organization and enabling us to expand the care and advocacy we provide for our youth,&#8221; <span class=\"xn-person\">Arash Ghafoori<\/span>, CEO of NPHY, said. &#8220;The 2023 partnership is reflective of our ongoing strategic planning with Sands and its commitment to deeply understanding the youth homelessness issue and what is needed to give youth in crisis a pathway to sustainable independence and a bright future.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Youth homelessness remains a critical issue in <span class=\"xn-location\">Southern Nevada<\/span>. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in 2022 roughly 12% of youth experiencing homelessness across <span class=\"xn-location\">the United States<\/span> were residing in <span class=\"xn-location\">Nevada<\/span>, with 81% concentrated in <span class=\"xn-location\">Southern Nevada<\/span>. Homelessness risk factors have accelerated as the state of <span class=\"xn-location\">Nevada<\/span> is facing an estimated shortage of more than 80,000 affordable rentals for extremely low-income tenants, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The first-ever standalone Southern Nevada Youth Homelessness Needs Assessment, created through a community process driven by The Movement and the Southern Nevada Homelessness Continuum of Care (CoC) in 2022, found that 5,125 youth ages 14 to 24 depended on emergency shelters, transitional housing or a combination of these solutions in 2021, an increase from 4,252 youth in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our commitment to ending youth homelessness in <span class=\"xn-location\">Southern Nevada<\/span> is one of the cornerstones of our Sands Cares program in <span class=\"xn-location\">Las Vegas<\/span> because of the tremendous need in our region \u2013 and because we greatly value and believe in the capability of NPHY to uplift young people facing these circumstances,&#8221; \u00a0said <span class=\"xn-person\">Ron Reese<\/span>, senior vice president of global communications and corporate affairs, who spearheads corporate responsibility initiatives at Sands. &#8220;Whether it&#8217;s delivering programs and services to youth in crisis, building ultimate solutions or leading The Movement to End Youth Homelessness, NPHY has a vision and model that we believe can drastically reduce the impact on young lives and the incidence of youth homelessness in our state.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sands&#8217; support for youth homelessness falls under the global Sands Cares community engagement program&#8217;s priority on hardship relief. As part of the company&#8217;s hardship relief initiatives, Sands Cares provides resources to disadvantaged people and aids them in overcoming barriers to necessities such as food, housing and other critical resources.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about Sands Cares, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sands.com\/responsibility\/communities\/#our-program-sands-cares\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.sands.com\/responsibility\/communities\/#our-program-sands-cares<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To support NPHY in the fight to end youth homelessness, visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/nphy.org\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/nphy.org\/<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><b>About Sands (NYSE: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ticket-symbol\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#financial-modal\"><\/a><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/investor.sands.com\/home\/default.aspx\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LVS<\/a>)<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>Sands is the world&#8217;s preeminent developer and operator of world-class integrated resorts.
