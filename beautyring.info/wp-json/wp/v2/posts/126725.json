The property&#8217;s strategic location \u2014 being at the heart of key sites in <span class=\"xn-location\">Marin<\/span>, in proximity to <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco<\/span> and Wine Country, and next door to a billion-dollar retail and development zone \u2014 lends itself to a wealth of opportunities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, nestled amidst the scenic beauty of <b>Mount Tamalpais<\/b>, <b>Muir Woods<\/b>, and <b><span class=\"xn-location\">Stinson Beach<\/span><\/b>, the property holds remarkable promise with its robust infrastructure and assortment of amenities. Notably, it <b>boasts the largest outdoor hotel pool in <span class=\"xn-location\">Marin County<\/span><\/b> and <b>offers approximately 6,840 square feet of versatile event space <\/b>spread across seven ballroom and meeting rooms. The property also includes a generous restaurant and bar space and a charming outdoor seating area.<\/p>\n<p>Equinox Hospitality aims to unlock the latent potential of the property through a thorough renovation and strategic rebranding. The hotel will soon align itself with the growing portfolio of <b>Tribute by Marriott<\/b>, a brand recognized for its distinguished independent properties. Driving this initiative is a commitment to enrich the guest experience and create an environment that appeals to the local <span class=\"xn-location\">Marin<\/span> community and visitors from neighboring regions, such as <b><span class=\"xn-location\">Napa<\/span><\/b>, <b><span class=\"xn-location\">Sonoma<\/span><\/b>, and<b> <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco<\/span><\/b>. The renovation plans will kick off next year.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Having acquired five unique properties and executed more than <span class=\"xn-money\">$100 million<\/span> in hotel deal volume in the past year, Equinox is on a determined expansion path,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are keen on solidifying our presence in existing markets and exploring new promising ones. With an optimistic view on <span class=\"xn-location\">San Francisco&#8217;s<\/span> rebound, we aim to expand across the Bay Area. Our strategic partnerships with the major hotel brands continue to bolster our growth, and we remain confident about unearthing valuable opportunities, especially in <span class=\"xn-location\">California<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Texas<\/span>, even amid some uncertainties.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>High-resolution photographs of the property can be accessed by clicking\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3918413-1&amp;h=2478352573&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fsh%2F3w51myqzj8jm3es%2FAABh-CmC3PX3sFmTQm4Sr0U0a%3Fdl%3D0&amp;a=here\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><b><u>About Equinox Hospitality<\/u><\/b> <br class=\"dnr\">Equinox Hospitality is a premier hotel investment, management, acquisition, and development company.
