Vail Resorts will bring new energy to the ski area, positively impacting the entire economic structure of the region of Crans-Montana.

Vail Resorts&#8217; network will be a definite asset, especially in <span class=\"xn-location\">North America<\/span>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Subject to closing adjustments, the valuation for the resort operations is expected to be <span class=\"xn-money\">CHF 118.5 million<\/span>, including approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">CHF 7 million<\/span> of debt that will remain in place. Vail Resorts anticipates that the resort will generate approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">CHF 5 million<\/span> of EBITDA in its fiscal year ending <span class=\"xn-chron\">July 31, 2025<\/span>, the first full year of operations following the expected closing later in fiscal 2024. Vail Resorts anticipates EBITDA growth over time from the inclusion of the resort on the Epic Pass products, network synergy, and investments in the guest experience. Subject to the timing of capital project approvals and completion, Vail Resorts is planning to invest approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">CHF 30 million<\/span> over the next five years in one-time capital spending to elevate the guest experience, and the resort is expected to generate over <span class=\"xn-money\">CHF 15 million<\/span> of annual EBITDA following these investments and including the impact from incremental Epic Pass sales. This initial phase of growth of the resort is expected to be primarily driven by operating and marketing initiatives along with capital investments focused on maximizing gastronomy efficiencies and improving and expanding snowmaking capabilities. After closing the transaction, normal annual maintenance capital expenditures for Crans-Montana Mountain Resort are expected to be approximately <span class=\"xn-money\">CHF 3 million<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>The transaction is expected to close during the 2023-24 ski and ride season, subject to certain third-party consents. Operations at Crans-Montana Mountain Resort for the 2023-24 winter season will continue in the ordinary course of business. Vail Resorts is committed to retaining the vast majority of employees, the existing operational infrastructure, and local expertise. Vail Resorts will incorporate areas of expertise from its business strategy, including enhancements to data and analytics capabilities, accessibility with the Epic Pass product lineup, and best practice sharing from its mountain operations.<\/p>\n<p><b>About Vail Resorts, Inc.
