Lynch also played roles in television shows (\u2018Westworld,\u2019 \u2018Brooklyn Nine-Nine,\u2019 and the breakout summer hit \u2018Bottoms\u2018). Brian &#8220;The Boz&#8221; Bosworth, linebacker for the Seattle Seahawks, also acted in several films including (\u2018Stone Cold,\u2019 \u2018The Longest Yard\u2019 and \u2018Three Kings\u2019). <\/p>\n<p>\u2018Signing Day,\u2019 written and directed by Glen Owen, is a dramatic comedy based on the sensational fictional story about one of the most important days for high school football players seeking football scholarships. The story follows an ambitious football coach, Walt McFadden, but he\u2019s no good at the politics that rule today\u2019s game. Buried at the bottom of the Louisiana University staff and almost fired for failing to sign one of last year&#8217;s top prospects, he gets a second chance when he is sent to rural Alabama with a bag full of cash and instructions to do whatever it takes to sign the nation\u2019s top defensive end, Tony Raymond. Promised a promotion if he succeeds, Walt hits the road and soon finds himself having to outflank rival recruiters, grifting townsfolk, and Tony\u2019s own dysfunctional family.<\/p>\n<p>This film is full of humor, heart and grit and highlights the NIL (name, image, likeness) deals turning teens into instant celebrity millionaires and how college sports fanatics hope young recruits will take their team to a national championship game.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Signing Day\u2019 will be produced by Glen Owen from State Line Films, Don Mandrik from Georgia Production Finance, as well as John Thomas and Kristy Clabaugh from SB Pictures. The production team is proud to point out that the film is completely homegrown in Georgia. It was not only written, developed and produced in the state, but was also fully financed by a small group of Georgia-based investors with NFL Hall of Famer and UGA legend Champ Bailey serving as one of the executive producers alongside Tiffany FitzHenry for FitzHenry Films. Mitch Olsen, Kevin McGrail, and Seth Ingram are also Executive Producers.<\/p>\n<p>Writer and Director Owen describes the process of recruiting and signing aspiring college football players as a system that has \u2018spun out of control:\u2019 \u201cI didn\u2019t set out to write an expose. I simply wanted to create a film that takes a humorous, but clear-eyed look at what\u2019s happening today on the college football recruiting trail. The coach in \u2018Signing Day\u2019 is prepared to do whatever it takes to sign the star player but starts to realize that the \u201cbig-time\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily what it\u2019s cracked up to be.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>After graduating from the University of Georgia (where he played on the Bulldogs SEC championship basketball team) with a degree in film, Owen moved to Atlanta to pursue his dreams of becoming a filmmaker. He went on to serve as Associate Creative Director at TNT, where he turned out work for the NFL and NBA. While at Turner, Owen coined \u201cWin. Or Go Home\u201d for the NBA Playoffs. In 2004, Owen formed State Line Films where he directs national commercials and narrative branded content projects for brands like Mercedes Benz, Delta Airlines, Geico, Dodge and numerous others.<\/p>\n<p>Most recently, Owen co-wrote and directed the thriller \u2018Stalked Within\u2019 for Paramount\/BET. He also served as Co-Producer on the hit comedy, \u2018Golden Arm,\u2019 which aired on HBO.<\/p>\n<p>Media Contact:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nElise Riley<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHead of Marketing &amp; PR<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nelise@myglobalpresence.com<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFounder\/CEO, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/myglobalpresence.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">My Global Presence<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.myglobalpresence.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.myglobalpresence.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Elise Riley<br \/>My Global Presence<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/679820302\/mailto:elise@myglobalpresence.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">elise@myglobalpresence.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=aPzzCixF0qqoB8jN&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      January 08, 2024, 16:26 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/679820302\/charles-esten-marshawn-lynch-brian-bosworth-and-brad-carter-join-all-star-cast-for-movie-signing-day\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
