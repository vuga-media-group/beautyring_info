Feedwater sources may include saltwater, brackish water, groundwater, and surface water. Brine is a byproduct of the desalination process. Desalination is considered a sustainable alternative source of freshwater with the required quality and quantity. The primary benefit of desalination is that it can provide high-quality drinking water to areas with a water shortage. As countries seek solutions to water scarcity caused by climate change, industrial development, pollution, and population growth, desalination addresses diminishing freshwater supplies. Technologies for desalination are classified as membrane, thermal, and renewable. Due to the absence of chemicals, it is also more environmentally friendly than conventional water treatment methods.<\/p>\n<p><b>Download Free Sample Report PDF @ <\/b><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=Km2iD6Lz6y8dP2JpyS0RplaPx4EdJLxGQ3PnEd2A9AVqOJMYCLgvCnEY8ZMoMaq5nDEEjvgXAyvLXpUBiXvjBNspddZxNkRfJ_Ch2QSVOBEfbRtm9mCki8SRf8Ed9vo3PTaQWBd2KDdsucHF_nRATFJiHa1DaJ15SIiL1quXkwn_5JDzALyRQUjwkU3WFx3zcV4IUP5VjkcXeIChOSV0kYDIxyAIBxNgI99YpucSUSY=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b><u>https:\/\/straitsresearch.com\/report\/water-desalination-market\/request-sample<\/u><\/b><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Depleting Freshwater Resources Drives the Global Market<\/b><\/p>\n<p>According to Straits Research, <b><i>\u201cThe global water desalination market size was valued at USD 19.62 billion in 2022. It is estimated to reach USD 43.03 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 9.12% during the forecast period (2023\u20132031).\u201d<\/i><\/b> The depletion of freshwater resources is one of the greatest threats to economic growth, ecosystem health, and water security on a global scale. According to the International Water Management Institute, 1.2 billion people do not have access to potable water, although freshwater is vital to human health. According to the Wildlife Federation, by 2025, two-thirds of the global population could face water shortages. Recycling and wastewater recovery have become popular in the past decade due to rising water demand. Reusing wastewater decreases the volume and environmental threat of discharged wastewater and reduces the strain on ecosystems caused by the withdrawal of fresh water. In recent years, a heightened awareness of the problems posed by pollution of aquatic environments and water scarcity has rekindled international interest in desalination systems. More stringent regulations, rising costs for wastewater disposal, and the rising value of freshwater are causing water desalination to become a useful or even necessary option for wastewater management, thereby driving market expansion. <\/p>\n<p><b>Hybrid Desalination Process Creates Tremendous Opportunities <\/b><\/p>\n<p>The hybrid desalination process combines two or more technologies to take advantage of their comparative advantages. Some hybrid systems combine systems that utilize membrane desalination or thermal distillation, or both methods. Some hybrid systems also generate electricity to supplement the production of pure water. Hybrid systems have been considered a cost-effective alternative to stand-alone systems because they can reduce pressure and stress in terms of scaling and fouling, energy consumption, and the cost of desalinated water by enhancing the recovery rate and overall water quality. Implementing hybrid systems has improved the efficiency of desalination plants by improving product water and brine quality as their applications have expanded. Recent innovations in hybrid desalination technologies have produced environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and socially beneficial desalination techniques. <\/p>\n<p><b>Regional Analysis<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=w7Z2X0aRdRXRqHTCtkcgO5rjtixACEYR0ekJQyy4EQBZg9hePrqbb4RAbVakTF_7mdkUN1Hi2r1grC4Sm8WjX3ECQIeAkIsSvPrOXhXuNzpe9wP9M2qiaqyW7T8esSIVMbmLSBdPyul2YO2K_VAnggIJr5vkW4jueJ0o1CiqoiMS22qZQvVGo8bqpj1W6e3Y\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>Middle East and Africa water desalination market share<\/u><\/a> is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.03% over the forecast period.
