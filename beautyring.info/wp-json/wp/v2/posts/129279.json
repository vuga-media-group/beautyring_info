They are commonly used in patients with urinary retention, post-surgery recovery, or those requiring continuous urine drainage. The global indwelling catheters market has expanded with the development of minimally invasive catheterization techniques, improved materials, and patient-friendly designs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Market Overview<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>The global indwelling catheters market is characterized by the following factors:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:8pt;\">\n<strong>Aging Population<\/strong><strong>: <\/strong>The increasing geriatric population is a significant driver for the indwelling catheters market, as older adults are more prone to urinary issues and require long-term catheterization.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:8pt;\">\n<strong>Urinary Disorders<\/strong><strong>: <\/strong>The rising prevalence of urinary incontinence, neurogenic bladder, and other urinary disorders contributes to the demand for indwelling catheters.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:8pt;\">\n<strong>Technological Advancements<\/strong><strong>: <\/strong>Innovations such as antimicrobial coatings, improved materials, and user-friendly designs enhance the performance and patient experience of indwelling catheters<strong>.<\/strong>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Market Drivers<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:8pt;\">\n<strong>Increasing prevalence of UTIs:\u00a0<\/strong>UTIs are one of the most common infections in the world. They are caused by bacteria that enter the urinary tract through the urethra. Indwelling catheters can increase the risk of UTIs, as they provide a direct pathway for bacteria to enter the bladder. However, indwelling catheters are often necessary for people who are unable to empty their bladders independently.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:8pt;\">\n<strong>Bladder cancer:\u00a0<\/strong>Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and the eighth most common cancer in women. Indwelling catheters are often used to drain urine from the bladder during and after treatment for bladder cancer.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:8pt;\">\n<strong>Benign prostatic hyperplasia:\u00a0<\/strong>BPH is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland. It is a common condition in men over the age of 50. Indwelling catheters are often used to drain urine from the bladder in men with BPH.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>If You want to Purchase Specific Insights By Segment\/Region\/Competitor, Request For Customization@ <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=6kWZQZGIjD7T-Fc0YCCDf-wvEuJJTFfx6DrzTCba2FNmnD6-sTjREHBQps3HWgal6jPavRWvoS_ImkSz4OEn6PuMEdUmD3i49VQgD0mSBd_uY64RBVetRp4MlaLIkDxmUN5HIRENy50DyRp0jPFSy8f1MjS-IubjaWcrecWDVSPU2jnt4J2qtmwbc256gXxqaYKSRfJDK7PuPe9nJdhbAWCs9dy6jf88Mxbr1f4ZoMY=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>https:\/\/www.persistencemarketresearch.com\/request-customization\/32043<\/u><\/a> <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Market Restraints<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-top:0cm; margin-bottom:8pt;\">\n<strong>Infection risks:\u00a0<\/strong>Indwelling catheters can increase the risk of infection, such as UTIs.
