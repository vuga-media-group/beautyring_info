TrueNAS 24.04 is the fourth major version of the company\u2019s Linux-based data platform software, furthering the mission to provide true data freedom by continually improving on the exceptional flexibility, interoperability, and storage efficiency that has already made TrueNAS the world\u2019s most deployed storage software.<\/p>\n<p>Codenamed \u201cDragonfish\u201d, TrueNAS 24.04 is expected to be the best-ever version of TrueNAS, representing the next step in major advancements in  security, performance and functionality of the platform over all previous releases of TrueNAS (CORE and SCALE). The 42% growth in the number of organizations using TrueNAS over the past 18 months corresponds to the two consecutive <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ixsystems.com\/blog\/truenas-named-customers-choice-in-north-america-in-gartner-peer-insights\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Customers\u2019 Choice awards<\/a> in Gartner\u2019s annual Voice of the Customer Report for the Primary Storage category. During this same time, users of TrueNAS Enterprise also rated their experiences 4.9 out of 5 in the Distributed File Systems and Object Storage category.<\/p>\n<p>TrueNAS 24.04 introduces SMB and Admin auditing, and the Enterprise support of Restricted Admins and Immutable Snapshots. Additionally, TrueNAS 24.04 has a simplified and improved Share Creation workflow, and open client sessions for both the SMB and NFS file sharing protocols can now be managed from the TrueNAS web UI for further simplicity and efficiency. <\/p>\n<p>TrueNAS Enterprise H-Series<\/p>\n<p>The TrueNAS Enterprise H-Series is the newest member of the iXsystems\u2019 storage system portfolio. Available in dual-controller configurations and with options for hybrid or all-flash storage, the TrueNAS H-Series is designed to provide reliable storage for cost-optimized workloads at the Edge or data center that can scale up to 2 petabytes (PB) in capacity. The series introduces two models, the TrueNAS H10 and the forthcoming H20, both having a compact 2U form factor with these benefits:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Power-Efficiency: With a typical power consumption of 100-300 watts , the TrueNAS H-Series helps meet your corporate sustainability and environmental initiatives.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; High-Availability (HA): Available dual-controller architecture provides continuous accessibility, providing over 99.999% uptime.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Expandability: With optional 24, 60, or 102-bay expansion shelves, the H-Series is ready to grow from 20TB all-flash to 2PB hybrid storage.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The availability of the new TrueNAS Enterprise H-Series, powered by TrueNAS 24.04, exemplifies our commitment to advancing the world\u2019s most widely deployed storage software,&#8221; stated Morgan Littlewood, Senior Vice President of Product Management at iXsystems. &#8220;The H-Series provides the smallest and lowest power footprint while the M-Series and F-Series deliver Hybrid scalability and All-flash performance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>TrueNAS Open Storage Community<\/p>\n<p>A testament to the draw of TrueNAS, the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.truenas.com\/community\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">TrueNAS<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> Open Storage Community<\/a> has grown significantly over the past several years.
