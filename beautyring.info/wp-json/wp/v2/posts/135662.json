Usually, I hear these stories from my clients but I, and my colleagues who worked together at my former treatment center, would continually tell, Dawn Theodore, that her personal story which interweaves these topics, along with her various relationships with the men in her life, was something she should write about. Now she has done just that. Besides being a therapist, Dawn, who is also a dancer and dance teacher, takes readers into the life journey of a kid growing up in the world of dance with a mother, a dance teacher herself, who both doted on Dawn and yet also controlled her and kept crucial things from her until she was forced to tell the shocking truth. Dawn\u2019s story is about dealing with one\u2019s circumstances and the pain of life while also grabbing the joys that living offers. Dawn is a dedicated, passionate, humble, generous human who sees the good in the world despite the sad, painful, or uncomfortable lessons that it brings. This is what she brings to her story and to you the reader who will surely find not only something to relate to but some take home messages from Dawn\u2019s journey.\u201d -CAROLYN COSTIN<\/p>\n<p>Carolyn Costin MA, MEd, MFT, Director of the Carolyn Costin Institute, Founder of Monte Nido Treatment Center, therapist, renowned eating disorder expert, activist, and author of 8 Keys to recovery, Your Dieting Daughter and The Eating Disorder Sourcebook<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDawn Smith-Theodore shares her amazing- heart wrenching story of disordered eating, romantic relationships, familial dysfunctions and secrets- specifically mother daughter- that color her path to finding her calling as dancer-teacher-airline stewardess and therapist.
