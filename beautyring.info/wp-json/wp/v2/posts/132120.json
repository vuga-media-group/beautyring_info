As we strive to protect and promote the vibrant oceans we sail, we are determined to accelerate innovation and improve how we deliver vacation experiences responsibly.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Today, in <span class=\"xn-location\">Barcelona<\/span>, Royal Caribbean International&#8217;s <i>Symphony of the Seas<\/i> became the first ship in the maritime industry to successfully test and use a biofuel blend in <span class=\"xn-location\">Barcelona<\/span> to meet part of her fuel needs. The company confirmed onboard technical systems met operational standards, without quality or safety concerns, demonstrating the biofuel blend is a reliable &#8220;drop in&#8221; supply of lower emission energy that ships can use to set sail across <span class=\"xn-location\">Europe<\/span> and beyond. The tests across <span class=\"xn-location\">Europe<\/span> also provided valuable data to understand the availability and scalability of biofuel in the region.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Royal Caribbean&#8217;s success is a clear example of how commitment to innovation makes possible the development of solutions to decarbonise the maritime sector. In this case, it involves the cruise sector and focuses on biofuels, an area in which the Port of <span class=\"xn-location\">Barcelona<\/span> is already working to become an energy hub, producing and supplying zero carbon fuels, such as green hydrogen and ammonia, and of other almost zero-carbon alternative fuels, such as methanol, biofuels or synthetic fuels. Innovation and collaboration between ports and shipping companies is key to accelerate the decarbonisation of maritime transport,&#8221; said the President of the Port of <span class=\"xn-location\">Barcelona<\/span>, Llu\u00eds Salvad\u00f3.<\/p>\n<p>The company began testing biofuels last year and expanded the trail this summer in <span class=\"xn-location\">Europe<\/span> to two additional ships \u2014 Royal Caribbean International&#8217;s <i>Symphony of the Seas<\/i> and Celebrity Cruises&#8217; <i>Celebrity Apex<\/i>. The sustainable biofuel blends tested were produced by purifying renewable raw materials like waste oils and fats and combining them with fuel oil to create an alternative fuel that is cleaner and more sustainable.\u00a0The biofuel blends tested are accredited by International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a globally recognized organization that ensures sustainability of biofuels and verifies reductions of related emissions.<\/p>\n<p>With <i>Symphony of the Seas<\/i> departing from the Port of <span class=\"xn-location\">Barcelona<\/span> and <i>Celebrity Apex<\/i> departing from the Port of <span class=\"xn-location\">Rotterdam<\/span>, both ships accomplished multiple sailings using biofuel and contributed critical data on the fuel&#8217;s capabilities. These results will help accelerate Royal Caribbean Group&#8217;s plans to continue testing the use of different types of biofuels on upcoming European sailings this fall. The company is exploring strategic partnerships with suppliers and ports to ensure the availability of biofuel and infrastructures to advance the maritime energy transition.<\/p>\n<p>Royal Caribbean Group&#8217;s sustainability journey began over 30 years ago, and it has remained steadfast in its commitment to innovate, and advance, the solutions necessary for a more sustainable future.\u00a0To learn more about Royal Caribbean Group&#8217;s sustainability efforts, information is available at\u00a0<u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3972301-1&amp;h=3575842830&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.royalcaribbeangroup.com%2Fseathefuture&amp;a=www.royalcaribbeangroup.com%2Fseathefuture\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.royalcaribbeangroup.com\/seathefuture<\/a><\/u>. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>About Royal Caribbean Group:<\/b> <br class=\"dnr\">Royal Caribbean Group (NYSE: <a rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"ticket-symbol\" data-toggle=\"modal\" href=\"#financial-modal\">RCL<\/a>) is one of the leading cruise companies in the world with a global fleet of 64 ships traveling to approximately 1,000 destinations around the world.
