There are two types of laser therapies: ablative and non-ablative. The use of a functional pulse-dyed laser in non-ablative laser therapy allows for the vascularization-based destruction of scar tissue. Additionally, creating advanced compression therapeutic clothing is anticipated to support market expansion.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Regional Analysis<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>North America is the most significant shareholder in the scar treatment market and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 9.3% over the forecast period.
