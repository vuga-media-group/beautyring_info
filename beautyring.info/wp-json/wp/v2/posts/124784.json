It is an economical method of giving animals the nourishment they require to develop and remain healthy. Compared to conventional feed, it is easier to carry and store. Also, it can be tailored according to the unique nutritional needs of various animals and the stages of their development. These factors are anticipated to increase the preference for compound feed over conventional feed, consequently accelerating the market\u2019s development. Furthermore, ingredients for compound feed are readily accessible and may be obtained from a wide range of sources. For large-scale cattle production, this offers a stable and dependable feed supply. Growth potential for the market players is projected to be profitable as a result of the expansion of supply chain networks and manufacturing capacities.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In Asia Pacific, meat consumption is rising as a result of rising economic levels and the ever-increasing population.
