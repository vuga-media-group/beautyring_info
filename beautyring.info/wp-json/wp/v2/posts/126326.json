The film, which chronicles the evolution of board diversity and the impact of Black women in American corporate spaces, has captivated audiences and shed light on their remarkable journey.<\/p>\n<p>Directed by renowned filmmaker Deborah Riley Draper of Coffee Bluff Pictures, &#8220;OnBoard&#8221; celebrates the journeys of Black women who have shaped the corporate landscape. From the pioneering efforts of Patricia Roberts Harris in 1971 to the present day, the documentary showcases the inspiring trajectory Black Women on Boards (BWOB), the global organization co-founded by Merline Saintil and Robin Washington.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to be the first,\u201d Saintil tells audiences. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re the trailblazer, just make sure you\u2019re not the last.\u201d Long before becoming co-Executive Producer of the film, Saintil knew she wanted to create something impactful, to benefit future generations. \u201cI stand on the shoulders of so many who poured themselves into my journey,\u201d she says, \u201cand I want to always pay it forward.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Reflecting on her own experience, Shannon Nash, co-Executive Producer of &#8220;OnBoard,&#8221; recognizes the importance of supportive role models. &#8220;Having professional mentors\/supporters, including my father, who often took me to his law school classes, was instrumental in shaping my aspirations,&#8221; Nash explains. She adds, \u201cI literally could see it to believe it and I want to do that for others.\u201d  Together, Saintil and Nash have channeled this desire to \u201clift as you climb\u201d to help inspire and support the next generation through this award-winning documentary.<\/p>\n<p>Saintil expressed her motivation for creating the documentary, saying, \u201cI started Black Women on Boards (BWOB) to build an ecosystem for accelerating outcomes for Black women who often lack visibility, network access, and sponsorship.&#8221;  Our members include women who already serve on boards and those who are board ready but lack visibility and access. Through referrals and word of mouth, we have grown from just 18 members in October 2020 to over 200 members globally. The success of BWOB in board placements and mentoring the next generation was a driving force behind bringing this story to a wider audience. <\/p>\n<p>Nash also shared her perspective on the film&#8217;s significance, stating, &#8220;I knew this story needed to be shared with the world. I wanted to shed light on all these incredible stories of Black women who have shaped the corporate landscape in America, often against great odds.&#8221; Nash&#8217;s introduction of Saintil to Deborah Riley Draper during a weekend spa trip set the wheels in motion for the groundbreaking documentary.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;OnBoard&#8221; takes viewers on a captivating year-long journey, capturing pivotal moments such as the women ringing the bell at NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange. Through the struggles and triumphs depicted in the film, audiences are presented with an inspiring and eye-opening portrayal of the remarkable achievements of Black women in corporate America.  <\/p>\n<p>The Jury Award received by &#8220;OnBoard&#8221; recognizes the film&#8217;s powerful message and its potential to create a positive impact. Saintil expresses her gratitude, stating, &#8220;To have &#8216;OnBoard&#8217; chosen for this honor is a true testament to the power of the film and its message.&#8221; Nash adds, &#8220;We are incredibly thankful to the entire team at Essence, particularly festival directors Lamonia Brown and Hakeem Holmes, for believing in this film and providing a platform for films like this to be showcased.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To learn more about &#8220;OnBoard&#8221; and its impact, please visit the official website at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.onboardthefilm.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.onboardthefilm.com<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>About Merline Saintil<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMerline Saintil, a former Silicon Valley tech COO, has taken six companies public and serves as Lead Independent Director of Rocket Lab, a space exploration company.
