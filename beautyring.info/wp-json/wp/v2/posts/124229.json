Nancy Manet will sign copies of her latest book, &#8220;My Expansion,&#8221; and meet fans at the Independent Book Publishers Association exhibitor booth (#3711) at 3:00 PM on Saturday and 11:30 AM on Sunday.<\/p>\n<p>Released as an adaptation of Nancy&#8217;s soon-to-be-released song, &#8220;My Expansion&#8221; captures her journey of reconciling a strict, dogmatic religious upbringing with her profound desire to love and support her free-spirited daughter. Through vivid poetry, Nancy poignantly portrays her struggle and ultimately finds her way toward understanding and acceptance.<\/p>\n<p>Illustrated by Michelle Buvala, &#8220;My Expansion&#8221; showcases the enchanting tale of Big Bear and their cub through captivating artwork, making it an engaging and accessible read for young audiences. The book is available for order from local independent bookstores and online retailers.<\/p>\n<p>Nancy is happy to offer a limited number of &#8220;My Expansion&#8221; copies exclusively for attendees of the American Library Conference. These limited edition copies will be available for signing at Booth 3711 on Saturday and Sunday. Due to the high demand and limited supply, conference attendees must visit the booth early to secure their copy during each of Nancy\u2019s 30-minute signing times.<\/p>\n<p>Writing from east Texas, Nancy Manet shares her experience, stating, &#8220;My upbringing led me to expect my children to conform like perfectly-potted tulips in a neat row. However, I discovered my first child to be more like a field of wildflowers. In my quest for perfection, I erred by being rigid and rule-driven instead of parenting with love and grace.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Nancy&#8217;s early life story of hardship, betrayal, and abandonment paved the way for her present-day success as an entrepreneur. Confronted with a choice between embracing her LGBTQ daughter or rejecting her, Nancy defied dogmatic, religious ideologies and embraced genuine love and empathy for her child. She firmly believes that rigid thinking and expanding love and empathy cannot coexist.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t miss the opportunity to meet Nancy Manet and have your limited edition copy of &#8220;My Expansion&#8221; personally signed at the American Library Conference. Join us at Booth 3711 on Saturday and Sunday to engage with this author who fearlessly explores parental love, acceptance, and personal growth.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about Nancy Manet and her book &#8220;My Expansion,&#8221; please visit the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/smalltoothdog\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">publisher<\/a> at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/smalltoothdog.com\/our-books\/myexpansion\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">smalltoothdog.com\/myexpansion<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Sean Buvala<br \/>The Small Tooth Dog Publishing Group LLC<br \/>+1 623-252-1420<br \/>staff@smalltoothdog.com<br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/smalltoothdog\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/smalltoothdog\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/smalltoothdog\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"PCcxNT8dmLs\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Author Nancy Manet: Getting Past Old Thinking\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PCcxNT8dmLs?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=B_-XY7Do4sViQ2tH&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      June 20, 2023, 23:01 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/640571341\/author-nancy-manet-appears-at-american-library-association-conference-2023-signing-her-book-for-lgbtq-families\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
