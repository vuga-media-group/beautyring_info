The other thing that was so beautiful about her and about what she said and did was she not only poured her heart out, she encouraged and uplifted each person in that room because we saw the tears. We saw the joy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI know it\u2019s an organization,\u201d Morris said, \u201cbut Velma has also made Embrace a brand to really build sisterhood and to build these young girls to know they can do whatever they put their hearts and minds to do.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cVelma brings out the best in everybody.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The event was sponsored by Steven Gurowitz, president of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.interiorsbysteveng.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Interiors by Steven G<\/a>, one of the country&#8217;s premier luxury interior design firms with over 85 employees.
