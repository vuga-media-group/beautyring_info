While we&#8217;re seeing some softness in mid-market and select service hotels, the luxury sector seems resilient. Guests visiting luxury properties are spending more on bucket list trips and staying for longer,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Richard Valtr<\/span>, Founder of Mews. &#8220;We&#8217;re also seeing a continuous rise in people extending work trips for some added leisure time and blending work with vacations. The most forward-thinking hotels are tapping into this trend by embracing personalized guest experiences and offering a variety of amenities that appeal to differing guest needs. More and more hotels are adopting technology that creates seamless experiences for their guests, no matter the reason for their trip.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Technology enables our teams to gather robust guest information before they<br class=\"dnr\">arrive at one of our locations, which empowers our customer service teams to create unique &#8216;excite and delight&#8217; opportunities for guests, resulting in powerful moments and lifelong memories for our guests,&#8221; commented <span class=\"xn-person\">Ryan Krukar<\/span>, VP Sales &amp; Marketing at <u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4200789-1&amp;h=1474330240&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fgravityhaus.com%2F&amp;a=Gravity+Haus\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Gravity Haus<\/a><\/u>. &#8220;Identifying and understanding a guest&#8217;s needs before they arrive at one of our locations and going above and beyond for guests is key in delivering authentic hospitality and provides additional value and comfort while simultaneously immersing a guest in the unique culture of the destination they are visiting.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Anticipating guests&#8217; needs is a crucial component to providing exceptional customer service throughout their stay,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Andrew Gauthier<\/span>, General Manager at <u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4200789-1&amp;h=4108083978&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Ftheinclinelodge.com%2F&amp;a=The+Incline+Lodge\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">The Incline Lodge<\/a><\/u>. &#8220;By tracking individual attributes and preferences of new and returning guests, we can provide a truly curated experience for every guest that comes through our door.
