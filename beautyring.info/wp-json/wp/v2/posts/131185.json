It arises when intestinal muscles fail to efficiently propel waste through the digestive system, resulting in compacted and hard-to-pass stool. Typical constipation symptoms include straining during defecation, feeling of incomplete evacuation, abdominal discomfort, bloating, and reduced bowel movement frequency. Several factors, including insufficient dietary fiber, inadequate fluid consumption, a sedentary way of life, specific medications, and underlying medical issues, can contribute to the onset of constipation.\u202f\u202f\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><strong>Request Sample of the Report:<\/strong> <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=gAdokVvyXSHpK4fx-PzAh9XzuDbs_ppdc4GZD-cEg1VOnkTQw_VUKaf8lDXOpvtf99MofuJqXxn_W9xLtKlPaaMwSebzb9jsNMyu9PEjzoPKPQyE0ufa8ayZ7W9YP-Y_yHEQVkp2tvIF1_BhCxp6Xl0KBIWxCM92Q9qu7cW6TjgxuGfP1qsyYdhVmPLoj4KS\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><strong>https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/request-sample\/8560<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\"><strong>Prime determinants of growth<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\" style=\"padding-left:0px;\">Rise in prevalence of chronic idiopathic constipation, increase in number of geriatric populations suffering from constipation and availability of different drugs for treatment of constipation is anticipated to boost the growth of market.
