The gurdwara is considered one of the five most sacred Sikh pilgrimages and was constructed at the spot where Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, stayed in 1708. Sahib Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji held his court at that spot. It is the site of his own tent of Sahib Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji. This site is now one of five Takhats which are places of primary importance to the Khalsa Panth. The other four Takhats are: Sri Akal Takhat at Amritsar, Takhat Sri Keshgarh Sahib at Anandpur, Takhat Sri Patna Sahib in Bihar District, and Takhat Damdama Sahib (adopted by SGPC in 1925) in Talwandi Sabo, Bhatinda, Punjab.
