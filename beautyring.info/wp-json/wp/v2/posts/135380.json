Delving deep into pivotal research, this book illuminates the profound connection between one&#8217;s work identity and their overall well-being in the workplace.<\/p>\n<p>At its very core, the significant highlights of Professor Adamsen&#8217;s work reveal the positive impact of a robust work identity on employees&#8217; well-being. Conversely, individuals who prioritize their personal identity in a work setting often grapple with elevated levels of work-related stress and burnout. Through detailed research, the book offers a critical revelation: emphasizing one&#8217;s personal identity or &#8220;being yourself&#8221; at work can potentially harm one&#8217;s well-being, performance, and career trajectory.<\/p>\n<p>In Work Identity \u2013 A Neurophilosophical Perspective, readers are presented with an interdisciplinary fusion of psychology, neurology, philosophy, sociology, real-life case studies, and a meticulous critique of prevalent tools and methodologies used for assessing work identity. One of the standout features of this book is its introduction to the pioneering &#8216;Work Identity Pro,&#8217; an exclusive test designed to measure work identity.<\/p>\n<p>As noted by Adamsen, who is also the Associate Professor and Head of Talent Lab at Zealand Academy of Technology &amp; Business, \u201ca concerning 80% of today&#8217;s employees find themselves disengaged from their work, with 44% experiencing work-related stress. This book seeks to understand the root causes behind these alarming statistics.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Daphne Halkias, Professor and Distinguished Research Fellow at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech Business School, applauds the book, saying, &#8220;This volume offers a unique blend of diverse disciplines. Much like Adamsen&#8217;s earlier contributions, this work is poised to become a benchmark in the coming years.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Eager readers can anticipate the book&#8217;s hardcover release in November 2023, but is already available to order in e-book format on <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/book\/10.1007\/978-3-031-37734-1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">SpringerLink<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Journalists interested in arranging an interview with Professor Adamsen about his profound research can contact him at bian@zealand.dk. <\/p>\n<p>About the Author<\/p>\n<p>Billy Adamsen is Associate Professor and Head of Talent Lab at Zealand Academy of Technology &amp; Business, Denmark.
