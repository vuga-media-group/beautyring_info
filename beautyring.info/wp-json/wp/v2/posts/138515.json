Forbes has praised her diverse artistic abilities, describing her as a poet, photographer, and scholar with sensitivity, precision, and intelligence. Renowned as an accomplished memoirist, Sternburg&#8217;s previous work, &#8220;White Matter: A Memoir of Family and Medicine,&#8221; was recognized by Publishers Weekly as one of the &#8220;Big Indie Books of Fall.&#8221; In her latest work, Sternburg blends her photography and writing to craft a narrative that seeks to view Mexico without presuming to comprehend it from a foreigner&#8217;s perspective.<\/p>\n<p>After falling in love with Mexico twenty-three years ago, Sternburg made the decision to permanently relocate there in 2022, to the same city, San Miguel de Allende, where she began to take photographs, now bringing a fresh perspective to her artistic endeavors. She asked herself,\u00a0&#8220;How can I make a book of photographs that isn\u2019t only a\u00a0gringo\u2019s\u00a0way of looking at Mexico?&#8221; The question is answered in her newest book, &#8220;<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com.be\/-\/en\/Janet-Sternburg\/dp\/3954765780\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Looking at Mexico \/ Mexico Looks Back<\/a>,&#8221; which offers a collection of visually stunning photographs complemented by an intriguing conversation between two people: Sternburg, originally from the United States culture, and Jos\u00e9 Alberto Romano Romero, a native of Mexico.<\/p>\n<p>This groundbreaking bilingual collaboration in photography and words across the Mexican\/USA\u00a0border takes readers on a journey of transformation and understanding. Originally Sternburg&#8217;s physical therapist, Romero saw Sternburg&#8217;s images on the wall of her studio. He brought an eye-opening perspective to her visuals born from his own experiences. Sternburg asked him to collaborate on this book, giving rise to a series of narratives that accompany her photographs, deepening the resonance of the images and revealing a story of reciprocal understanding and shared humanity. <\/p>\n<p>The book interweaves between the keenly observed and the deeply personal, balancing the exploration of universal themes with a particular focus on the multidimensional realities of Mexican life. It is as much an exploration of Sternburg&#8217;s relationship with photography and her surroundings, as it is a celebration of the layers of culture, history, and personal stories that Mexico holds. <\/p>\n<p>Unlike many contemporary artists, Janet refuses to employ techniques that alter her images, setting her apart as a true original in a world dominated by digital manipulation. She explains, &#8220;My work is about revealing a layered world of complexity and wonder. I use low-tech cameras because they give me what I want. I do not use manipulation.&#8221; By embracing the expertise of her discerning eye, viewers are granted an authentic and captivating experience that reveals the beauty of her subject matter.<\/p>\n<p>Amidst the complexities of our globalized world, the themes of cross-cultural communication, exploration, and understanding tackled within Janet&#8217;s work hold paramount significance. Her artistic vision provides a timely and poignant perspective that transcends boundaries and fosters a sense of unity. &#8220;Looking at Mexico \/ Mexico Looks Back&#8221; is a testament to the power of photography as a vehicle for cultural exchange, dialogue, and understanding. <\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.janetsternburgphoto.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">ABOUT THE AUTHOR<\/a><br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nJanet Sternburg is a writer of memoirs, essays, poetry, and plays, as well as a fine art photographer.
