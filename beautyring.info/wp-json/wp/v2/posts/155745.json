In her 186-page book, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/Undermining-U-S-Constitution-Diane-Vann\/dp\/1998784886\/ref=monarch_sidesheet_title\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">\u201cUndermining the U.S. Constitution&#8221;,<\/a> Vann tackles a critical issue she likens to a pervasive disease: the alarming rise of communism in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Drawing from her extensive medical background, Vann compares the insidious spread of communism to the stealthy progression of cancer. Just as cancer can begin with an invisible seed and develop with little warning, communism has quietly infiltrated many aspects of American life, threatening to engulf the nation.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUndermining the U.S. Constitution&#8221; serves as a crucial call to action. Vann emphasizes that, similar to a patient\u2019s survival depending on their awareness of cancer, the future of the United States hinges on its citizens recognizing the communist threat. Her book includes the complete text of the Communist Manifesto, juxtaposing its objectives with the principles of the U.S. Constitution. Vann\u2019s analysis reveals stark contrasts between these ideologies, underscoring the need to defend the Constitution against its adversaries.<\/p>\n<p>During her service as an Army nurse, both domestically and internationally, Vann witnessed how the respect and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution led to extraordinary achievements. However, she also encountered individuals whose beliefs resonate with the Communist Manifesto, highlighting a persistent threat from domestic and foreign opponents of the Constitution. Vann urges patriots to remain vigilant and prepared to uphold the nation\u2019s foundational principles.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUndermining the U.S. Constitution&#8221; is not just a book; it is a rallying cry for every American who values their freedom and the principles that make the United States exceptional. Vann encourages readers to engage with her insightful analysis and join the ongoing fight to protect the Constitution.<\/p>\n<p>Diane Vann&#8217;s journey began when she enlisted in the United States Army Student Nurse Program while studying at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in 1972. After graduating in 1974 and serving in California, she was assigned as a Reserve Army Nurse Corps officer on active duty in West Germany. Her experiences, including visits to both West and East Berlin, deepened her awareness of the Communist threat, which she associates with the policies of President Obama. In the spirit of her service during the Vietnam War, Vann chose to leave her nursing education role to run for the United States House of Representatives in 2010. <\/p>\n<p>With a strong belief in the power of education, Vann aims to break through the normalcy bias that often clouds American awareness. Her book, &#8220;Undermining the U.S. Constitution&#8221; is now available for purchase on Amazon and other major online retailers.
