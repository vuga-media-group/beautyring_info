Then he goes beyond all of that, diving into the very heart of humanity\u2019s existence, by charting a path \u2014 both scientific and mystical \u2014 for reclaiming the inherent joy and richness of life. <\/p>\n<p>Reclaiming the Sacred explores profound questions, including:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 How important is money to happiness? <br \/>\u2022 What is the optimal amount of money and possessions for a person to be happy? <br \/>\u2022 Does having kids make people happy? Getting married? Having sex? Working?<br \/>\u2022 What are some of the most serious effects of global warming? <br \/>\u2022 What kinds of changes will people have to make as individuals and as a society as a result of global warming? How will those changes allow people to actually live better lives? <br \/>\u2022 What does the economic system get wrong when it comes to what really matters, and how should progress be measured? <\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Reclaiming the Sacred takes readers on a journey that follows the golden threads of happiness, abundance and belonging \u2014 and leads them home. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have an opportunity to reweave ourselves back into the human community and the family of all living beings, the family of the land and trees, the otters and grasses \u2014 to live with them in relationships of respect and wonder,\u201d Golden adds. \u201cWe have an opportunity to reclaim ourselves and this world as sacred.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<br \/>Jeff Golden has been teaching and writing about the topics he covers in his book for over 30 years, most recently at Vassar College.
