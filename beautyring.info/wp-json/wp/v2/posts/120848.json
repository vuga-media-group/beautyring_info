Diabetes is a chronic condition, meaning it lasts a long time, often forever. There isn\u2019t a cure for diabetes, but there are different ways to manage it. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com\/our-team\/denise-pate-md\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Dr. Denise Pate<\/a> with <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Medical Offices of Manhattan<\/a> has the details.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe body converts food into a kind of sugar called glucose, which then gets released into your bloodstream. The pancreas makes a hormone called insulin that allows your cells to consume the glucose. This is how the body\u2019s cells get energy. But with diabetes, either the insulin isn\u2019t being produced, or the cells aren\u2019t responding to it, so glucose builds up in the bloodstream, and that can lead to major issues,\u201d said Pate.<\/p>\n<p>There are many types of diabetes. Type 1 and type 2 are the most common, with type 2 accounting for about 90% of all diabetes cases and type 1 making up most of the rest. Type 1 is something people are born with and is usually diagnosed by early adulthood. With type 1 diabetes, the body simply stops producing insulin. Type 2 diabetes develops over time. The pancreas still makes insulin, but the cells in the body stop responding to it.<\/p>\n<p>Gestational diabetes is also common. This form of diabetes occurs during pregnancy, and it\u2019s something doctors will be alert for during this time. It usually resolves on its own after childbirth, but not always. Other less common forms of diabetes can include:<\/p>\n<p>Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LUDA, sometimes called type 1.5)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMaturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDiabetes caused by certain medications<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDiabetes caused by other diseases like pancreatitis<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPrediabetes is also a significant form to be aware of. About a third of US adults fall into the prediabetes category, and most don\u2019t know they have it. Having prediabetes means that your blood sugar levels are too high, but are still shy of the requirements for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. It\u2019s so important to know about this, because this is when it\u2019s still possible to avoid diabetes,\u201d Pate said.<\/p>\n<p>Symptoms of both diabetes and prediabetes can include:<\/p>\n<p>Being very thirsty or very hungry<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHaving to urinate often<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFatigue<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBlurry vision<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nUnexplained weight loss<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nTingling or numbness in the hand or feet<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFrequent infections, including yeast infections<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHaving sores that don\u2019t heal or heal very slowly<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDry skin<\/p>\n<p>However, many people might have diabetes or prediabetes without having any symptoms yet, though complications will eventually become noticeable. For people with an increased risk of diabetes, regular testing of blood sugar levels could help catch this disease early and avoid serious problems.<\/p>\n<p>Type 1 diabetes is more common in people with immediate family members who also have type 1 diabetes. It can occur at any age, but it\u2019s usually diagnosed by early adulthood.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if they\u2019re overweight, over the age of 45, or have a family history of diabetes. Exercising fewer than 3 times per week also increases risk. Anyone who has ever had gestational diabetes also has a higher risk of eventually having type 2 diabetes,\u201d said Pate.<\/p>\n<p>While type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, type 2 can be prevented by making healthy lifestyle choices related to diet, exercise, and tobacco use. Some of the ways to reduce the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes include:<\/p>\n<p>Quit smoking, or avoid starting<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFollow a daily exercise routine that includes at least 30 minutes of moderate activity<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nEat more fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAvoid refined carbohydrates, saturated fats, and trans fats<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nReduce portion size<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFor people who are overweight or have obesity, aim to lose 5% body weight, and then maintain that weight<\/p>\n<p>Once diabetes sets in, a doctor will be able to diagnose it using blood testing. They will also gather information about any family history of diabetes or autoimmune disorders.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cEven after someone has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, the prevention methods are still effective for minimizing the impact of diabetes, though at that point they might also be prescribed medications which may or may not include insulin,\u201d said Pate.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor people with type 1 diabetes, insulin injections will definitely be needed. There are a lot of different ways to monitor and deliver insulin, and different types will either start working more or less rapidly and will last for different amounts of time. A doctor can help navigate the varying options to find a good fit,\u201d Pate added.<\/p>\n<p>Over time, diabetes is associated with a number of serious complications. Some of these include:<\/p>\n<p>Stroke<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHeart disease<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHeart attacks<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nKidney disease<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nNerve damage<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nInfections<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nLoss of vision or hearing<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor those at risk of diabetes, it\u2019s so important for overall health to reduce your risk while you can. Making a few healthy choices now will pay dividends later. And for those who aren\u2019t sure where to start, ask your doctor,\u201d said Pate.<\/p>\n<p>Medical Offices of Manhattan offers comprehensive health care at four locations in New York City. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Denise Pate, MD, is a board-certified internal medicine specialist and Medical Director at Medical Offices of Manhattan.<\/p>\n<p>Contact: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.mcprpublicrelations.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.mcprpublicrelations.com<\/a> <\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Melissa Chefec<br \/>MCPR, LLC<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/632964684\/tel:+1 203-968-6625\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">+1 203-968-6625<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/632964684\/mailto:melissa@mcprpublicrelations.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">melissa@mcprpublicrelations.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=MFF-lPUl6RbFXwzy&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      <span>MCPR, LLC<\/span>\n    <\/p>\n<p>\n      May 11, 2023, 13:45 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/632964684\/what-to-know-about-diabetes-mellitus\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
