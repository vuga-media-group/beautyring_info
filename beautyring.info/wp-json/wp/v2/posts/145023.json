This prestigious event will share information and education from July 18-20, 2024, in Osaka, Japan, by global experts in this rapidly growing field. Robinson will present his keynote speech entitled &#8220;Terpene Glycosides and Nanotechnology: Achieving Endocannabinoid Balance and Activation,&#8221; based on his globally recognized theory on Endocannabinoid System (ECS) Balance Control.<\/p>\n<p>Mike Robinson is the founder of the Global Cannabinoid Research Center (GCRC) and a recognized figure in cannabinoid research and advocacy. With a profound personal and professional background in cannabinoid therapy, Robinson has dedicated a significant portion of his career to exploring the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids, particularly in the context of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and its role in maintaining homeostasis within the human body.<\/p>\n<p>His work encompasses studying various cannabinoids, including but not limited to CBGA (cannabigerolic acid), and their effects on the ECS. Robinson&#8217;s research focuses on how cannabinoids can be used to restore balance within the ECS, potentially offering relief and therapeutic benefits for individuals with various medical conditions. This area of study is particularly relevant for conditions that may be associated with an imbalance in the ECS, such as chronic pain, epilepsy, cancer, and neurological disorders, among others.<\/p>\n<p>Robinson is also known for his advocacy for cannabis accessibility and his efforts to educate the public and medical community about the benefits of cannabinoids. Through the GCRC, he aims to advance cannabinoid research and promote an understanding of how cannabinoid therapies can be optimized for medical use. His contributions to the field have been recognized in the cannabis community, and he has been named one of the most influential people in cannabis by High Times.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Robinson&#8217;s personal story, including his use of cannabinoid therapy for his health challenges and his role as a father to two adopted autistic children, adds a deeply personal dimension to his professional endeavors. His advocacy extends beyond the scientific community to include support for patients and families navigating the complexities of cannabinoid therapy.<\/p>\n<p>Through his leadership at the GCRC, Mike Robinson continues to be at the forefront of cannabinoid research and education, contributing valuable insights and fostering discussions that aim to unlock the full therapeutic potential of cannabinoids.<\/p>\n<p>The Researcher explained what his creation is: <\/p>\n<p>&#8220;A terpene glycoside is a compound that combines a terpene and a sugar molecule (glycoside). Terpenes are a large and diverse class of organic compounds produced by various plants, including cannabis, known for their aromatic properties. They are responsible for the distinctive smells of many plants, herbs, and fruits. Conversely, glycosides are molecules in which a sugar is bound to a non-carbohydrate moiety, often a small organic molecule.<\/p>\n<p>When a terpene gets linked to a sugar molecule, it forms a terpene glycoside. This linkage can modify the terpene&#8217;s solubility, stability, and biological availability. Glycosylation (adding a sugar molecule to another molecule) can also affect how a compound interacts with biological systems, potentially altering its effects and metabolizing it in the body.<\/p>\n<p>In the context of plants, terpene glycosides can contribute to various biological functions, including plant defense mechanisms against herbivores and pathogens, as well as the attraction of pollinators. These compounds are attractive for their potential therapeutic properties in human health and wellness. Adding sugar molecules can make terpenes more water-soluble, enhancing their bioavailability and enabling new applications in medicine and pharmacology, including their role in influencing the endocannabinoid system for health benefits.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>His innovative creation, NANO TERPS, was made over five years ago when the world-renowned Cannabinoid Medicine researcher discovered a way to develop future topical transdermal applications for both Nutraceutical and pharmaceutical purposes using Nanotechnology and terpenes. <\/p>\n<p>Innovative Ideas Come to Life at Indoc Meetings:<\/p>\n<p>Indoc Meetings is a premier international gathering that focuses on materials science, optics, nanomaterials, and nanotechnology, attracting experts from around the globe.
