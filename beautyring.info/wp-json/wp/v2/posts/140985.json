Finding sustainable revenue models while keeping services affordable is a challenge.<\/p>\n<p>Market Competition: The market is highly competitive, with both traditional financial institutions and fintech startups entering the space. Differentiating and staying ahead of competitors is an ongoing struggle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Opportunities:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Market Expansion: The micro-investing concept still has substantial growth potential, as it appeals to a broader audience of potential investors who may have been deterred by traditional investing barriers.
