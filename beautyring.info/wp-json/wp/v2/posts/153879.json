The Biden Administration underscored its commitment to advocating for the rights and dignity of women around the world. This event featured remarks by Vice President Kamala Harris and included many survivors and experts on gender and violence against women from around the world.<\/p>\n<p>Vice President Harris highlighted the urgent issue of sexual violence in conflict zones, calling for stronger global measures to prevent such atrocities. AMMWEC, representing a diverse group of American Muslim women leaders, stood with her in this condemnation, stressing the need for international cooperation and robust support for survivors. VP Harris announced the launch of a new initiative, &#8220;Dignity in Documentation,&#8221; aimed at improving the documentation and reporting of conflict-related sexual violence. \u201cCondemnation and accountability are essential. Perpetrators must face consequences for their actions,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy heart breaks for the trauma and pain inflicted in each of these conflicts,\u201d she said. \u201cGlobally, our system of accountability remains inadequate,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt is the responsibility of all of us\u2014governments, international organizations, civil society, and individual citizens\u2014to actively confront combat-related sexual violence and work to rid our world of this heinous crime.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In an earlier meeting with Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President and Director of the White House Gender Policy Council and other women&#8217;s organizations, AMMWEC\u2019s president, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/anilaali.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Anila Ali<\/a>, had shared their solidarity with Jewish and Israeli sisters who had been inflicted with atrocious violence by Hamas terrorists. As the first Muslim American women\u2019s civil rights organization, AMMWEC had visited the kibbutzim and witnessed firsthand the crimes committed by Hamas terrorists against women. At the event, a screening of Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s, former Facebook executive widely known for her work in advancing gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment through her book &#8220;Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead&#8221; has produced the documentary &#8220;Screams Before Silence&#8221; which left the audience of women leaders speechless. Amit, a young girl who was raped by Hamas terrorists, bravely shared her story and emphasized that she holds no hate in her heart. Instead, she sees her experience as a calling to advocate for the release of hostages and to speak out against the use of rape as a weapon of war.<\/p>\n<p>AMMWEC women leaders met with Ambassador Lipstadt from the State Department, who serves as the Envoy on Antisemitism. They also engaged with influential Jewish leaders such as Sheryl Sandberg, Sheila Katz, and Elizabeth Cullen.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIslam does not allow anyone to touch noncombatant women, and these Israeli women were raped with calls of Allah Hu Akbar. This was a desecration of our faith and God\u2019s holy name by Hamas terrorists,\u201d stated Anila Ali, president of AMMWEC. \u201cWe are committed to standing against such atrocities and advocating for justice for all women.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Zeba Zebunnesa, an AMMWEC executive, echoed the organization\u2019s commitment to ending violence against women, emphasizing that they will not rest until action is taken to stop such atrocities. \u201cSilence over October 7 sexual violence betrays all women. I\u2019ve not seen any public condemnation from Western women groups who pride themselves on their feminist credentials. We saw no protests or condemnation on social media about the horrific acts that these Israeli women suffered for being Jewish women. Where are the #MeToo supporters? Are these Jewish women not human?\u201d said Zeba Zebunnesa.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs American Muslim women, we have a unique role to play in advocating for peace and justice,\u201d said Soraya Deen, AMMWEC executive and CEO of Muslim Women Speakers. \u201cOur faith and values guide us to speak the truth and so we are committed to continuing this fight and to amplifying the voices of survivors until all the hostages are released.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Vice President Kamala Harris was resolute in her condemnation of violence against women and the use of rape as a weapon of war by Hamas terrorists. Her leadership and support were instrumental in bringing together women from diverse backgrounds to stand united against such heinous acts. AMMWEC remains dedicated to advocating for justice and equality for all women, regardless of their religious or cultural background. The organization calls for immediate action to address and prevent further violence against women and vows to continue standing with Jewish and Israeli sisters in their fight for justice and dignity.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAbout AMMWEC:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\ninfo@ammwec.org <\/p>\n<p>The American Muslim &amp; Multifaith Women\u2019s Empowerment Council (AMMWEC) is dedicated to promoting the rights, dignity, and empowerment of women.
