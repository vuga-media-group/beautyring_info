DeVille and Scales will discuss hip-hop\u2019s impact on Georgia\u2019s economic development and the entertainment industry in a magazine-style format Q&amp;A moderated by award-winning entertainment journalist Phil W. Hudson.<\/p>\n<p>The 50th Anniversary of Hip-Hop Lunch and Learn is a local community event to celebrate, commemorate, educate and reflect on the significance of hip-hop in Georgia and its importance to the state&#8217;s development. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHip-hop music has been a major contributor to the overall economic and business successes of Georgia and has been a major business feeder to the thriving, multi-billion dollar film industry,\u201d Greater Georgia Black Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Melinda C. Sylvester said. \u201cWe want to elevate, celebrate and educate business leaders on how that transpired and how our state\u2019s contribution established us as a major player worldwide in entertainment. We think that contribution has been overlooked.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHip-hop is 50 years old and AARP Georgia is excited to celebrate this milestone and honored to recognize the significant impact hip-hop has had over the years,\u201d AARP Georgia State Director Debra Tyler Horton said. \u201cSomething hip-hop and AARP have in common is the ability to elevate voices that are not heard nearly enough. At AARP Georgia, we know that the longer you live, the more you need a wise friend and fierce defender. That\u2019s why AARP is here to be an advocate for the 50+ and provide resources to build confidence, healthy habits, wealth and so much more.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFifty years ago hip-hop was the fastest growing industry that helped Georgia to increase its national business profile and establish our entertainment leadership position,\u201d Trulieve Georgia President Lisa Pinkney said. \u201cWe believe Trulieve is part of that next movement in business growth that will further elevate Georgia\u2019s national position. Supporting the hip-hop industry remains a focus of our key marketing initiatives, particularly in support of Georgia\u2019s diverse communities. This was a perfect event for us to sponsor in partnership with fellow brands including GGBCC and AARP.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Greater Georgia Black Chamber of Commerce is a member of the National Black Chamber of Commerce and was incorporated in 2016.
