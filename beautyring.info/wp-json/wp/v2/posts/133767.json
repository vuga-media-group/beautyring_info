With each episode, he crafts a tapestry of emotions\u2014woven with threads of his personal stories, struggles, and learnings. This emotional resonance, paired with Bravery&#8217;s innate gift of narration, led &#8216;These Fukken Feelings Podcast to a glorious win at the People&#8217;s Choice Podcast Awards in the Health category.<\/p>\n<p>His journey, characterized by self-reflection and resilience, has been a beacon for many. Diagnosed with dyslexia early on, Micah navigated a world that sometimes appeared to be written in a script he couldn&#8217;t decipher. Rather than being limited by this, he turned his challenges into strengths, embracing his unique perspective. This duality\u2014of feeling out of sync with the world, yet drawing from it a wellspring of creativity and understanding\u2014has been a recurring theme in his work.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no surprise that Bravery&#8217;s podcast resonated with such a vast audience. The title alone, &#8216;These Fukken Feelings Podcast\u00a9, encapsulates the essence of the show\u2014unfiltered, candid, and strikingly real. In it, Bravery doesn&#8217;t merely share stories; he invites listeners into the sanctum of his experiences, making them both the audience and participant in his emotional odyssey.<\/p>\n<p>Supporting his auditory journey is his written masterpiece, &#8216;Love Beyond the Battle.&#8217; In this tome, Bravery&#8217;s narrative prowess shines through. Much like the podcast, the book isn&#8217;t a mere recounting of events\u2014it&#8217;s a deep dive into the human soul&#8217;s labyrinth. Readers have acclaimed it for its touching portrayal of love, endurance, recovery, and self-revelation.<\/p>\n<p>Although &#8216;These Fukken Feelings Podcast\u00a9 celebrated the win in the Health category, another remarkable recognition was Micah&#8217;s nomination for the Best Male Host. While he may not have clinched the title, this nomination stands as a testament to his exceptional connection with his audience. It&#8217;s not just about the voice, the words, or the narrative; it&#8217;s about the soul behind it all\u2014and Micah Bravery&#8217;s soul is, without a doubt, deeply interconnected with his audience.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the digital air is charged with anticipation. Why? The announcement that fans and admirers have eagerly been waiting for is finally here. Season Three of &#8216;These Fukken Feelings Podcast\u00a9 will premiere on November 1, 2023. The forthcoming season promises more\u2014more depth, more emotions, more raw moments, and more life-altering revelations.<\/p>\n<p>With two successful seasons under his belt, what can listeners expect from the third? If history is any indication, it will be a continuation of Bravery&#8217;s hallmark authenticity. There will be stories that evoke tears, laughter, introspection, and a gamut of feelings in between. Micah Bravery is set to yet again take his audience on a whirlwind ride\u2014one where emotions aren&#8217;t just felt; they&#8217;re lived.<\/p>\n<p>In his words, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t just another season. It&#8217;s a renewed promise\u2014a commitment to stay genuine, to share more, to learn more, and to grow together. We&#8217;ve laughed, cried, reflected, and grown over two seasons. Now, it&#8217;s time to delve deeper, together.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The podcast realm is vast, with numerous voices vying for attention. Yet, among these, Micah Bravery stands tall and distinguished, not because he speaks louder, but because he speaks truer. &#8216;These Fukken Feelings Podcast\u00a9&#8217; is not just a podcast; it&#8217;s an experience, a journey, a revelation.<\/p>\n<p>Join Micah Bravery as he embarks on this new chapter. The path may have its twists and turns, but with Bravery as the guide, it promises to be an unforgettable expedition.<\/p>\n<p>In the midst of &#8216;These Fukken Feelings&#8217; success, Season 2.5 saw the podcast&#8217;s horizon expand with two notable additions: Rebecca, who brought a fresh dynamic as co-host, and Crystal, the driving force behind the scenes as the producer.
