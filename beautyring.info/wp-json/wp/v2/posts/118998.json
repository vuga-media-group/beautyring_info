Attendees get to choose which events interest them the most, with activities happening across multiple spaces at Mad Arts.   <\/p>\n<p>\u201cFilmmakers in our communities are telling incredible stories that we want to amplify, support, and celebrate,\u201d said Eddy Moon, who co-founded White Elephant Group in 2013 with two other local filmmakers, Ronald Baez and Kevin Ondarza. \u201cWe invite guests to enjoy WEG WEEKEND, leave their preconceived notions of film screenings at the metaphorical door and experience films from a whole new perspective.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Among the highlights of WEG WEEKEND include:<\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\tTelling Women\u2019s Stories, a screening and digital dialogue panel featuring female, male and queer voices discussing female stories told from unique perspectives.  Audiences can engage with panelists via a digital screen, displaying audience questions, polls and discussion topics for voting.  <\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\tThe Pictures of: Pioneer Winter Collective, a celebration of nationally-recognized works created by the Pioneer Winter Collective, will be discussed, demystifying the art of creating dance films. <\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\tIn The Mirror Room, where a limited number of guests will be invited into an enclosed room to experience a variety of South Florida short films and engage with fellow audience members about the film. <\/p>\n<p>\u25cf\tVR Room Exhibit, presenting two award-winning VR Projects that participants can watch via VR headsets.

Miami-based Third Horizon celebrates cinema from the Caribbean, its Diaspora, and other spaces of the Global South.<\/p>\n<p>WEG WEEKEND supports White Elephant Group\u2019s core beliefs, that South Florida independent filmmaking is a cultural necessity. The event also aims to promote diversity and inclusion by boasting discussions with composers from two Caribbean-centric films on shaping music for their films, conversations about how to best support women and non-binary storytellers and more. Attendees can also participate in a screening of the feature film, \u201cSylvie of the Sunshine State,\u201d which received the Spirit of Slamdance Award at the Slamdance Film Festival, as well as roundtable discussions on topics such as gearheads, cinematographers and agents and managers in the film industry. <\/p>\n<p>Moon adds, \u201cWe really want WEG WEEKEND to feel like an arcade or theme park in that there\u2019s always something to do, learn and explore. We welcome the public to check it out, meet and network with filmmakers and see what we\u2019re all about.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This exciting event and The WEG Short Film Lab are made possible thanks to grants from the John S. and James L.
