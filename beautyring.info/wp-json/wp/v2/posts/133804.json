In the Euro area, easing headline inflation is contributing to increased real incomes and economic activity.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> is expected to witness substantial GDP growth as the pandemic threat diminishes, and the government revises its zero-COVID policy. <span class=\"xn-location\">India<\/span> remains on track to become a trillion-dollar economy by 2030, surpassing <span class=\"xn-location\">Japan<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Germany<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>However, challenges persist, including uncertainty surrounding the war in <span class=\"xn-location\">Ukraine<\/span>, slower-than-expected global inflation decline, and ongoing food and fuel inflation in developing nations. High retail inflation continues to impact consumer confidence and spending.<\/p>\n<p>Governments are addressing these challenges, which is boosting market sentiments. As governments work to combat inflation by raising interest rates, new job creation may slow down and impact economic activity. The regulatory landscape is evolving, with increasing pressure to incorporate climate change considerations into economic decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Despite potential challenges to corporate investments due to inflation concerns and weaker demand, the rise of new technologies offers opportunities. Technologies such as generative AI, applied AI, machine learning, next-generation software development, Web3, cloud and edge computing, quantum technologies, electrification, renewables, and climate technologies beyond electrification and renewables have the potential to drive substantial incremental growth and value to global GDP in the coming years.<\/p>\n<p>In this mixed economic environment, businesses that exhibit resilience and adaptability will find opportunities amid challenges, positioning themselves for future success<\/p>\n<p><b>What`s New?<\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Special discussions on the global economic climate and market sentiment<\/li>\n<li>Coverage on global competitiveness and key competitor percentage market shares<\/li>\n<li>Market presence analysis across multiple geographies &#8211; Strong\/Active\/Niche\/Trivial<\/li>\n<li>Online interactive peer-to-peer collaborative bespoke updates<\/li>\n<li>Access to digital archives and trademarked research platform<\/li>\n<li>Complimentary updates for one year<\/li>\n<li>Access to curated YouTube video transcripts of market sentiments shared by CEOs, domain experts and market influencers via interviews, podcasts, press statements and event keynotes<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Key Topics Covered:<\/b> <br class=\"dnr\"><br class=\"dnr\"><b>I.
