The two additional titles on the list were &#8216;Before It Ends&#8217; by Anders Walter and the documentary &#8216;Apolonia, Apolonia&#8217; by Lea Glob. All three films are produced with support from the Danish Film Institute.<\/p>\n<p>Jacob Neiiendam, Head of International at The Danish Film Institute and chairperson of the Danish Oscar Submitting Committee, says:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe past few weeks have made it very clear that &#8216;The Promised Land&#8217; is the strongest Danish candidate to secure a Oscar nomination. It received a fantastic reception from both critics and award experts at its world premiere in the Venice competition as well as at Telluride and Toronto. The film has American distribution through Magnolia, who previously brought Danish films like Nikolaj Arcel&#8217;s &#8216;A Royal Affair&#8217; as well as \u2018The Hunt\u2019 and \u2018A War\u2019 to the Oscars.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Promised Land<\/p>\n<p>&#8216;The Promised Land&#8217; by Nikolaj Arcel is set in 1755. The impoverished Captain Ludvig Kahlen sets out to conquer the harsh, uninhabitable Danish heath with a seemingly impossible goal: to build a colony in the name of the King. In exchange, he&#8217;ll receive a desperately desired Royal name for himself. But the sole ruler of the area, the merciless Frederik de Schinkel, arrogantly believes this land belongs to him. <\/p>\n<p>\u2018The Promised Land\u2019 finds Director Nikolaj Arcel reunited with lead actor Mads Mikkelsen who also played the lead role in &#8216;A Royal Affair&#8217;. The film received an Oscar nomination in the \u201cForeign Language\u201d (now known as \u201cInternational Feature Film\u201d) category in 2013.<\/p>\n<p>At the recent World premiere in Competition at the Venice Film Festival, the film was well recieved by international critics who especially praised Mads Mikkelsen&#8217;s performance and the film&#8217;s epic scope. Variety highlighted Arcel&#8217;s &#8220;sturdy, old-school feel for grand-scale period filmmaking&#8221; and the Hollywood Reporter called the film &#8220;a terrific story driven by skillful writing and strong performances&#8221; and further noted that &#8220;there&#8217;s an art to bringing vitatity and modernity to historical drama, and Arcel shows a firm grasp of it&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to Venice, &#8216;The Promised Land&#8217; has participated in several prominent festivals including Telluride, Toronto and San Sebastian. The film is produced by Louise Vesth for Zentropa and has received financial backing from the Danish Film Institute.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe Danish Oscar Submitting Committee<\/p>\n<p>The Danish Oscar Submitting Committee consists of Danish film professional representatives appointed from various film associations and guilds as requested by the Academy of Motion Picture, Arts &amp; Science (AMPAS).<\/p>\n<p>Society of Danish Film Editors: Henrik Thiesen, Editor<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDanish Cinema Owners Assoc. : Sune Lind Thomsen, Cinema Owner, Gentofte Cinema<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDanish Screenwriters Guild: Ina Bruhn, Screenwriter<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDanish Film Critics Assoc.: Jacob Ludvigsen, Film critic, Soundvenue<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDanish Film Directors Assoc. : Lisa Jespersen, Director<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDanish Cinematographers Guild: Louise Mclaughlin, DOP<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDanish Film Institute: Jacob Neiiendam (Chairperson of the Committee), Head of International<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDanish Film Institute: Lena Juhl Seidelin, Marketing Consultant, Feature Films<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDanish Producers Assoc.: Pernille Bech Christensen<\/p>\n<p>Oscars rules and dates<\/p>\n<p>Each country may submit one film for nomination in the International Feature Film category.
