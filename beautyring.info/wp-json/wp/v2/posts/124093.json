I cannot wait for guests to enjoy the ancient indigenous culture and traditions of Jiuzhaigou through a unique Ritz-Carlton Reserve lens.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Jiuzhaigou Valley Scenic and Historic Interest Area covers nearly 180 thousand acres in northern <span class=\"xn-location\">Sichuan Province<\/span> and is protected as a national nature reserve. The ancient forest ecosystems of Jiuzhaigou National Park are home to <span class=\"xn-location\">China&#8217;s<\/span> beloved giant pandas and other rare species of plants, animals, and birds.

U.S.-based architectural firm WATG paid homage to the natural surroundings and Tibetan heritage with the use of traditional building forms and locally-sourced materials. The landscaping was led by <span class=\"xn-person\">John Pettigrew<\/span>, who created the immaculate gardens with indigenous planting to reflect the extraordinary\u00a0landscapes. The elegant interiors were designed by the late Indonesian interior design legend <span class=\"xn-person\">Jaya Ibrahim<\/span>, who curated palettes of forest greens,\u00a0emeralds, and icy blues to mirror the jewel-colored lakes and waterfalls of Jiuzhaigou, while celebrating the culture and heritage of the local villages with examples of artisanal Tibetan craftsmanship throughout the property.<\/p>\n<p>Guests arriving at Rissai Valley are warmly welcomed with a Zhaxi Dele Tibetan blessing ceremony, and every new day brings opportunities to be immersed in experiences that provide insights into local heritage and life. Through a dedicated team of local Tibetan culturalist, \u00a0artisans, chefs, and healers, guests are welcomed into an ancient culture to gain transformative insights along with genuine connections with the people of Jiuzhaigou and their families. Each villa enjoys the services of a dedicated personal host, called a &#8220;Nieba&#8221; in the local language, who takes care of every detail for guests, ensuring a seamless stay experience. In this idyllic setting, guests can discover the artistry of Tibetan folk dance and classical music, as well as discover calm and balance through the meditative practice of Thangka painting, a unique Tibetan art form. In the early morning, guests can also join on a leisurely hike into the pristine forests surrounding the property.<\/p>\n<p>Dining at Rissai Valley offers memorable experiences complemented by the beautiful surroundings, from romantic al fresco dinners in a picturesque garden setting overlooking the forests, to memorable family picnics by crystal-clear streams\u00a0or elegant cocktail\u00a0events\u00a0against a backdrop of snow-capped mountains. <b>Bo Ri Village<\/b> offers all-day dining in an idyllic ancient village situated opposite the Reserve.
