You can make your situation better, no matter what situation you\u2019re in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In their book, Leslie Glass, a bestselling author, and Lindsey Glass, an award-winning documentarian, get candid about their tumultuous relationship and share the formula that helped them reconnect after being estranged for four years. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe book was designed to create hope and healing no matter what\u2019s happened,\u201d Lindsey Glass said. \u201cWe do recover. We can heal. We can stop engaging in destructive or unhealthy behavior. It just takes some understanding, compassion and practice.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The Mother-Daughter Relationship Makeover features an interactive blend of actionable information, compelling storytelling and writing prompts to help bring awareness, understanding, and compassion to mothers and daughters everywhere. <\/p>\n<p>At the book\u2019s core is the four-step process that helped the authors understand each other, ease their conflicts, and rediscover their appreciation and love: <\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Revealing Your Back Story <br \/>\u2022 Exploring Your Emotional and Personality Styles <br \/>\u2022 Understanding Your Conflicts and Triggers <br \/>\u2022 Learning the Tools to Restore the Love<\/p>\n<p>Along the way, readers learn empowering insights about the impact of generational trauma; the most common issues mothers and daughters fight about and why; how to nurture forgiveness and healing; and whether family members should reconcile at all and how to do so safely.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you take the time to figure out what\u2019s at the root of these things and then find the compassion and the respect to treat this precious person a little bit better knowing what they\u2019re going through, I think the relationship can be so much stronger,\u201d Lindsey Glass added. <\/p>\n<p>About the Authors<br \/>Lindsey Glass grew up in New York City and received her B.A. from Johns Hopkins University and her M.A. from New York University.
