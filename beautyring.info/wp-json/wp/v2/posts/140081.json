Like Lori, Josh\u2019s looks and appetite for adventure belie his 70-plus years, and Lori finds herself mesmerized by his blue eyes and sweet talk. Lori is all smiles as she steps out of the shower the next morning \u2014 until she sees his bloody corpse lying in the bed where they had just made love.<\/p>\n<p>The London police naturally suspect Lori, but the case becomes infinitely more complicated when it\u2019s discovered that plenty of people have a motive to murder Josh. On the case is Scotland Yard Inspector Geoffrey Holmes, American FBI agent Jordan Gould, and Lori\u2019s granddaughter Cate and her fianc\u00e9, Joseph, who both happen to be London solicitors. <\/p>\n<p>Sparks fly, as Cate and Jordan Gould experience a growing mutual attraction, as do Lori and Inspector Holmes. Adding another twist is that Lori\u2019s family has an unforeseen connection to Joseph\u2019s father, Lord Roger Lunt, and to the wealthy German nobleman Baron Joseph Braun and the horror of the Holocaust. <\/p>\n<p>So who killed Josh? Was it Josh\u2019s beautiful girlfriend Suzi, who unexpectedly appears in London? Josh\u2019s Chinese financial backers? British mobsters, who kidnap Lori in an attempt to find Josh\u2019s hidden millions? Was it Baron Braun, who summons Lori to Germany to tell her a 70-year-old secret? Or was it someone else entirely? <\/p>\n<p>Murder Across the Ocean can be read as a standalone murder mystery or as the follow-up to Wexler\u2019s book, Lori, the origin story of the plucky protagonist. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cLori Brill combines the unexpected smarts of Miss Marple; the genteel strength of character and family circle of Jessica Fletcher; and the hard-boiled sexiness of V.I. Warshawski,\u201d Wexler said.  \u201cReaders who enjoy books about those characters will enjoy Murder Across the Ocean. Mature female readers, who have not yet found a hero who is like them, will at last have one in Lori Brill.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<br \/>A native Chicagoan, Charlene Wexler has been a teacher, wife, dental office manager, mother and grandmother.
