The 13-track album, which features <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheBoBice\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Bo Bice<\/a>, Carson Peters, Gary Nichols, Jeff Parker, Josh Shilling, Keith Garrett, Larry Cordle, Robert Hale, Shonna Tucker, Tim Shelton, Tim Stafford, Bill Taylor, and Ward Hayden, will be <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/orcd.co\/silverbulletbluegrass\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">available on vinyl, disc, and all streaming platforms<\/a>, with a pre-sale starting June 28.<\/p>\n<p>Produced by Randall Deaton (Larry Cordle, Ralph Stanley II, Blue Moon Rising), and engineered by Deaton, Jimmy Nutt, and Gary Nichols, the project first came to life back in 2012. A few tracks were cut, but other commitments got in the way and life moved on. Deaton acquired a business called Lake Fanny Hooe Resort and Campground located in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, and that kept the album on the back burner. Several years later, Deaton\u2019s commitment to the tribute was reignited in part by the enthusiasm of engineer Jimmy Nutt (Jason Isbell, The Dead South, The Blind Boys of Alabama) and Grammy award-winning artist\/songwriter Gary Nichols (The SteelDrivers). \u201cSeger\u2019s songs are timeless and the vocal performances by these artists were too good to stay hidden any longer,\u201d Deaton notes. \u201cI am incredibly proud of this record.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>The album\u2019s first single, \u201cRamblin\u2019 Gamblin\u2019 Man,\u201d (released on February 23) gives listeners a taste of what\u2019s in store. Featuring American Idol star Bo Bice, the record is drawing large streaming numbers and media attention. Melissa Clarke (Americana Highways) calls the track \u201cnonstop \u2026 sexy, smoky,\u201d noting it includes \u201cfrenzied guitar and mandolin and whirls of the banjo.\u201d Bice excels with an edgy vocal that sizzles. <\/p>\n<p>SILVER BULLET BLUEGRASS also showcases vocal performances by Grammy-award winner, Kentucky Music Hall of Famer singer\/songwriter Larry Cordle; IBMA award winner and member of The Boxcars and Blue Moon Rising Keith Garrett; multi-instrumentalist, vocalist and member of Wildfire Robert Hale; singer\/songwriter\/guitarist Ward Hayden (The Outliers formerly known as Girls Guns &amp; Glory); Grammy award-winning singer\/songwriter\/guitarist Gary Nichols; singer\/mandolinist, Jeff Parker (founding member of Dailey &amp; Vincent and former member of The Lonesome River Band); The Voice alumnus and young Bluegrass fiddler Carson Peters; Tim Shelton, Bluegrass fan favorite and founder of The Tim Shelton Syndicate; Grammy award-winning singer\/songwriter Josh Shilling; Grammy award-winning guitarist\/singer\/songwriter, and two-time IBMA Songwriter of the Year Tim Stafford; popular Eastern Kentucky newcomers, The Appalachian Heatherns&#8217; vocalist\/bassist, Bill Taylor; and singer\/songwriter\/bassist and former member of the Drive-By Truckers Shonna Tucker. <\/p>\n<p>Nearly 30 of the best and brightest Bluegrass musicians brought their talents to SBB. On Guitar are Richard Bennett, Shawn Brock, Larry Cordle, Stephen Mougin, and Gary Nichols. Mandolin players include Shawn Brock, Jeff Parker, Tony Robertson, and Darrell Webb. Richard Bailey and Ned Luberecki played Banjo, and on Bass are Mike Bub, Mike Flemming, and David Hood. Fiddle players include Tim Crouch, Shawn Lane, Megan Lynch, Carson Peters, and Tammy Rogers. Dobroists include Wayne Bridge, Phil Easterbrook, and Jake Joines. Harmony Vocals were contributed by Sarah Borges, Shawn Lane, Gary Nichols, Tim Shelton and Cindy Walker.  <\/p>\n<p>SILVER BULLET BLUEGRASS Track List<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nLong Twin Silver Line (Carson Peters)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nTurn The Page (Gary Nichols)  <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHollywood Nights (Shonna Tucker)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAgainst The Wind (Tim Shelton)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nYou\u2019ll Accompany Me (Keith Garrett)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nWe\u2019ve Got Tonight (Jeff Parker)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nRamblin\u2019 Gamblin\u2019 Man (Bo Bice)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nBetty Lou\u2019s Gettin\u2019 Out Tonight (Ward Hayden)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMain Street (Josh Shilling)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nEven Now (Tim Stafford)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFeel Like A Number (Robert Hale)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nRoll Me Away (Bill Taylor)<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nNight Moves (Larry Cordle)<\/p>\n<p>SILVER BULLET BLUEGRASS has broad appeal and should charm Seger fans and Bluegrass lovers alike. For engineer Jimmy Nutt, the recordings offered a chance to reunite in the studio with several players and singers. \u201cI am so grateful to Randall for letting me work on this. It was an incredible experience.\u201d For Deaton, \u201ccapturing the power and essence of these classic Rock songs in a Bluegrass presentation was a challenge. But the result goes to prove that the skills of top-tier Bluegrass musicians and vocalists are unmatched. I hope folks enjoy listening to it as much as we all enjoyed making it.\u201d SBB was created at the Lonesome Day Recording Studio in Booneville, KY and The NuttHouse Recording Studio in Muscle Shoals, AL.  <\/p>\n<p>Follow Lonesome Day Records on their website, Facebook, and YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>ABOUT Lonesome Day Records<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nLocated in Booneville, KY, the company was established in 2002 by audio engineer and record producer Randall Deaton.
