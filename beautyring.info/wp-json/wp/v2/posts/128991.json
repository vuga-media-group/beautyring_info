The historical event will recognize the outstanding contributions of creatives and executives who have made significant contributions to West Coast hip-hop history. These hip-hop trailblazers will be recognized on the California State Assembly and California State Senate floor, thanks to the efforts of the California Legislative Black Caucus leaders, Chair, Assembly Member Lori Wilson, and Vice-Chair, Senator Steven Bradford. The program will also include a rally for peace on the steps of the Capitol, a voter registration drive, and entertainment.\u00a0<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nThe Watts Riots and other episodes of civil unrest on the West Coast gave rise to a music genre and global culture, hip-hop.
