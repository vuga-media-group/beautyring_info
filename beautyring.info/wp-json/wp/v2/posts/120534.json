The films have been collectively released under the title &#8220;OBAFA&#8221;. This is the second film festival this year that has accepted Muhammed Dibbasey short films.  Dibbasseys spoken word piece &#8220;They Say&#8221; is a powerful and moving indictment of corruption and injustice. The poem is a cry for justice and equality, and a call for change. <\/p>\n<p>Muhammed Dibbasey is a 24 year old Gambian who offers a unique perspective on life in the Gambia through his spoken word pieces. His work is both personal and political, and he is a powerful voice for change. His character in his work is Obafa Onema. Obafa&#8217;s story, like that of Dibbasey\u2019s, is one of resilience and determination, having been forced to quit high school to provide for his family after his father was killed in the war. Despite these challenges, Obafa has continued to write and create, and his work is an important contribution to the conversation about the future of the Gambia.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are proud to have worked with Muhammed on this film,&#8221; said Max Barrett, Director of MaximillianGroup. &#8220;His work is important for Gambia, and we are excited to help him share it with a global audience.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The credits for &#8220;They Say&#8221; include Obafa Onema as the voiceover, Muhammed Dibbasey as the director and executive producer, and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cellularvibrations.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Cellular Vibrations<\/a> (Busumbala, The Gambia) and MaximillianGroup (San Diego, California) as the producers. The film was edited by Max Barrett of MaximillianGroup, with art direction by the same company. The cover art was also created by Max Barrett. The film is distributed by MaximillianGroup and has its country of origin listed as &#8220;The Gambia&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>For those interested in watching &#8220;The Say&#8221; and other films in the Lift-Off First-Time Filmmaker Sessions Online Film Festival, tickets are available on the festival&#8217;s website starting May 15th. This is a great opportunity to support and discover new filmmaking talent from the comfort of your own home.<\/p>\n<p>The films are also available for viewing on YouTube at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL1HyNdOh5koBSVMde-yIxifEixvJWNajs\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL1HyNdOh5koBSVMde-yIxifEixvJWNajs<\/a><\/p>\n<p>ABOUT MAXIMILLIANGROUP<\/p>\n<p>MaximillianGroup is a digital marketing agency located in San Diego, California missioned on developing partnerships for sustainable economic impact in underserved communities and nations.
