By integrating the renowned Four Seasons service, we&#8217;re not just resetting standards; we&#8217;re redefining luxury living. Our commitment to quality remains unwavering, ensuring that our buildings continue to be the benchmark for excellence in the industry.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><b>Luxury Living in <span class=\"xn-location\">Miami&#8217;s<\/span> <span class=\"xn-location\">Coconut Grove<\/span><\/b><\/p>\n<p>The spaces designed by Michele B\u00f6nan reflect the renowned architect&#8217;s signature style, with a blend of timeless elegance and contemporary aesthetics.

The homes are crafted to be as polished as they are welcoming, exuding a sense of enduring sophistication achieved through classic lines, elegant furnishings, and a palette dominated by neutral tones.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The essence of <span class=\"xn-location\">Coconut Grove<\/span> and the cultural significance of the location&#8217;s past, including the gorgeous climate, spectacular views and exceptional quality of life, guided each step of the design process,&#8221; shares Michele B\u00f6nan. &#8220;Whether through design elements influenced by the rhythm of the ocean or patterns created in the sand, we maintained fluidity between the surroundings and the interiors to allow residents to relax and immerse themselves in the atmosphere of the space.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Homes at Four Seasons Private Residences Coconut Grove will feature nearly 11-foot (3.35 metre) ceilings throughout, complementing the spacious, open floor plans. Custom Italian-style kitchens designed by Molteni and B\u00f6nan feature top-of-the-line Miele appliances and European finishes, while bathrooms include cabinetry and panelling by Noorth complemented by Margraf marble finishes. Each home will be accessed via private elevator, creating an intimate arrival experience, and will feature the latest in-home automation systems and lighting controls.<\/p>\n<p>Designed to provide a luxurious and intimate residential experience, Four Seasons Private Residences Coconut Grove will offer an extensive amenities collection for residents, including a restaurant, library, state-of-the-art gym and yoga room, spa with cold plunge and hammam, children&#8217;s area and private event room, as well as an expansive pool deck and bar lounge serviced by Four Seasons. Residents will also enjoy the benefits of legendary Four Seasons service even without a hotel, including a dedicated Director of Residences, concierge, housekeeping and butler services, in-residence dining, valet and wellness programming, among other offerings.<\/p>\n<p>Four Seasons Private Residences Coconut Grove will reflect the neighbourhood&#8217;s refined, serene atmosphere, steeped in culture and connectedness. Residents will be in close proximity to the water and situated among the town&#8217;s beloved local boutiques, restaurants and some of the nation&#8217;s leading schools, creating a close-knit community and well-rounded walkable lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>The collaboration between CMC Group and Fort Partners is driven by the pair&#8217;s shared ambition to elevate the standard of living in a market that is yearning for true world-class real estate and hospitality. CMC Group has for years played a pioneering role in developing <span class=\"xn-location\">Miami&#8217;s<\/span> skyline and reshaping the greater condo market in <span class=\"xn-location\">South Florida<\/span>, while Fort Partners&#8217; longstanding partnership with Four Seasons includes the development of the iconic Four Seasons Hotel and Residences at The Surf Club, Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach, Four Seasons Hotel and Private Residences Fort Lauderdale, and ownership of Four Seasons Hotel Miami.
