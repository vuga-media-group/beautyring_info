On January 31st, 2024, Canada\u2019s Members of Parliament unanimously passed Private Members Bill C290, an Act to amend the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act (PSDPA) sponsored by MP Jean-Denis Garon \u2013 Mirabel, Quebec.  This Federal law, the PSDPA, on which the provinces have modelled their laws, is notorious world-wide for its ineffectiveness.  A <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ibanet.org\/MediaHandler?id=49c9b08d-4328-4797-a2f7-1e0a71d0da55\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">recent study<\/a> identified it as one of the worst in the world as it, in effect, had no best practices out of 20 recognized internationally for such legislation.  Now, thanks to MP Garon, it has 8 out of 20, a definite step in the right direction. <\/p>\n<p>According to Mr. Garon, \u201cThere is nothing more important for a government than an ethical, competent and responsible public service, and we must value the work of our public servants. Public servants are in the best position to note irregularities in government, in its management of public monies and use of Crown assets. Sometimes, out of a sense of responsibility, these officials become whistle-blowers by disclosing wrongdoing. It is an extremely important role. For that reason, we must protect them\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Garon thanked members of Whistleblowing Canada\u2019s Board and Advisory Board at a Jan. 31st Press conference for sharing their expertise during the legislative process.  This included internationally recognized expert Tom Devine, from the Government Accountability Project, Joanna Gualtieri, lawyer, who did the first analysis of the flawed Bill in 2004, and Pamela Forward, whose <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/repository.library.carleton.ca\/concern\/etds\/st74cr226\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">2017 study<\/a> identified that attention to culture concurrently is the over-riding factor for success in implementing whistleblower protection laws.  Each has worked in the field of whistleblowing for decades \u2013 Devine since 1978, and Gualtieri and Forward since the mid-1990\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>Whistleblowing Canada President Forward said \u201cWe salute MP Garon who immediately saw the urgent need to act when, shortly after his election, he began receiving many phone calls from whistleblowers with disturbing stories of retaliation for doing their jobs and disclosing wrongdoing\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Whistleblowing Canada looks forward to working with MP Garon and other MP\u2019s and Senators as Bill C290 begins the next step in the legislative process and is introduced in the Senate for approval. <br \/>&#13;\n<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Pamela Forward<br \/>Whistleblowing Canada Research Society<br \/>+ +1 604-989-9789<br \/>pamela@whistleblowingcanada.com<br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/discloser1\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/whistleblowcan\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Twitter<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/whistleblowing-canada-research-society\/?viewAsMember=true\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@whistleblowingcanadaresear7207\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=5nTSs4dz74hJNLYK&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      February 08, 2024, 14:58 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/687174190\/a-win-for-canada-s-public-servant-whistleblowers\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
