Prior to the days of playlists, the DJs set the pace for the game. A rapper knew where he or she stood by placement on a prominent DJ\u2019s mix. These mixes bumped through neighborhoods worldwide, at underground shows, and in clubs everywhere.  <\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the mixtape itself reflected and represented the heartbeat of hip-hop. The film follows its infiltration of the mainstream and all of the ups and downs that ensued\u2014from commercialization to criminalization to digitization and everything in between. <\/p>\n<p>The documentary also boasts previously never-before-seen performance footage of titans such as Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole in addition to wide-ranging interviews with Kid Capri, DJ Clue, DJ Drama. At the same time, industry veterans Lenny S and the late Combat Jack share seminal stories.  <\/p>\n<p>Plus, STR8 BANGAZ crafted the documentary\u2019s captivating original score. The latter not only draws on the golden era of hip-hop, but it also ushers viewers into the present-day. Notably, it will even include interview excerpts mixed by marquee DJs.  <\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the film moves like a mixtape-in-motion, thanks to STR8 BANGAZ. <\/p>\n<p>Bringing the vision to life, Joslyn Rose Lyons serves as a producer, and Lester London composing original music. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe mixtape is almost like you telling people I\u2019m worthy enough for you to be my fan or consumer.
