<p>WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA, UNITED STATES, August 6, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; Jeff Major, the acclaimed NASM Certified Nutrition Coach and Personal Trainer, and founder of Abs &amp; Aprons, is thrilled to announce the launch of the <a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.absandaprons.com/30-day-keto-dream-body-starter" data-wpel-link="external">30 Day Keto Dream Body Program</a>. Designed specifically for busy individuals, this innovative program promises to deliver life-changing results through a structured, hand-held approach to fitness and nutrition. Jeff built a program at a price point that anyone can afford, no matter their economic status as he believes anyone should have access to this.</p>
<p>The 30 Day Keto Dream Body Program offers a comprehensive, step-by-step plan that combines quick and easy 15-minute keto meal preps with personalized workouts tailored to each participant&#8217;s unique body type. With lifetime access available at a special pre-launch price of just $49 (normally $499), this program is both affordable and accessible, ensuring everyone has the opportunity to transform their body and lifestyle.</p>
<p>Key Features of the Program:</p>
<p>•  Personalized Workouts: Expertly crafted routines designed for different body types (ectomorph, mesomorph, endomorph) that can be performed anywhere, anytime.</p>

<p>Success Stories: <br />&#13;<br />
&#8220;Jeff helped me lose 70 lbs in just 7 months. I followed his guidance to a T and succeeded!&#8221; <br />&#13;<br />
&#8211; Antionette</p>
<p>&#8220;Saying &#8216;Yes&#8217; was zero risk thanks to their money-back guarantee. Jeff helped me achieve a 6-pack in just 6 months!&#8221; <br />&#13;<br />
&#8211; Brian</p>
<p>&#8220;The training breaks everything down into an easy-to-follow process. Insanely worth it if you&#8217;re on the path to your dream body goals.&#8221; <br />&#13;<br />
&#8211; Alicia</p>
<p>Jeff Major has been passionate about health and wellness from a young age. Starting with simple exercises at home, he eventually became a fully accredited NASM Certified Nutrition Coach and Personal Trainer. His years of experience and dedication to helping others achieve their fitness goals inspired him to create Abs &amp; Aprons and launch the 30 Day Keto Dream Body Program.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had someone to hand-hold me when I was learning all this myself,&#8221; says Jeff Major. &#8220;With the right guidance, anyone can optimize their body, feel happier, and achieve their true potential.&#8221;</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch, the 30 Day Keto Dream Body Program is available at an exclusive pre-launch price of $49. This offer includes lifetime access to the program and all its resources. Interested individuals are encouraged to act quickly as the offer expires soon.</p>

<p>The internationally known and recognized digital magazine began as a one-page idea during the 2009 global financial meltdown and was nurtured by Ms. Walker’s unwavering belief that if you build it, the audience will be there. It wasn’t quite that simple, but that single idea coupled with Ms. Walker’s commitment to deliver engaging and interesting content has helped the magazine continue to grow and develop.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Assassins of Fifth Avenue,&#8221; an edgy crime thriller, tells the story of a wealthy criminal mastermind, a serial killer, and a reporter determined to uncover the truth and the exiled detective she enlists to help her find the killer before he kills again.</p>

<p>Pastor Sean Lee is the lead pastor of Press Church, a young congregation that launched in October of 2020. Pastor Sean emphasized, “It’s all about moving towards Christ, regardless of where you think you are. We focus on what’s important and direct people towards that, rather than creating boundaries. We value relationships, the next generation, authenticity, and welcoming new people. Our goal is for everyone to embrace their identity in Christ and know that they matter and have purpose.” </p>
<p>Pastor Sean Lee and his wife Bethany are committed to involving the next generation in their efforts. As a millennial couple, they understand the importance of creating spaces where people can connect and grow together. Press Church is known for its innovative approach, hosting events at local venues like Nocterra Brewing Company and being actively involved in community activities such as volleyball at the Lazy Chameleon. With a team of leaders experienced in creative arts, Press Church brings a creative edge to its ministry.

<p>As a young church, Press Church aims to show the community that they are here, they care, and they enjoy having fun.

In a time where people are increasingly disconnected, we actively host events to bring people together and build meaningful relationships.”</p>

<p>PITTSBURGH, PA, USA, August 6, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; <br />
Kristi H. of Caledonia, MI is the creator of the Stationary Brush, a set of brushes with triangular-shaped handles rather than round. The brushes can be available in numerous configurations for almost any type of brush application. The triangular handle ensures the brush can be placed on a flat surface without it rolling away. The handle may also be comprised of a non-slip grip area. The handle could also be made from a deformable and/or flexible material to allow a side of the handle to be flattened to prevent rolling.</p>
<p>Each brush can be constructed using a plastic or wooden handle approximately 7- to 8-inches in total length. Brush bristles are attached to one end via a metal piece. Users can place their brushes on any flat surface to keep them stable when it is not being used. The brushes can be available in numerous sizes and configurations to accommodate any application such as cosmetics, artistry, manicures, and much more. </p>
<p>Markets for brushes are segmented into multiple niches such as cosmetic brushes, arts and craft brushes, household cleaning brushes, and more. The market for ergonomic tools, including triangular-handled brushes, is growing due to an increasing awareness of the importance of ergonomics in daily tasks. The global market for ergonomic products is expected to grow significantly, driven by the aging population and the need for efficiency when painting, applying cosmetics, completing housework, and numerous other tasks.</p>
<p>Most brushes are round and roll off flat surfaces when put down. Constantly picking up brushes off the floor is frustrating, coupled with the chance of contaminating the bristles with dirt, bacteria, and other debris. The Stationary Brush alleviates these issues with its innovative, versatile, and ergonomic triangular handle design. The brush would significantly enhance any manufacturer’s product line.</p>

<p>PRATTVILLE, ALABAMA, USA, August 7, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; G.B. Ryder weaves a profound book that dabbles with the clichéd theme of romance with a never-seen-before spin, a signature of Ryder’s own literary turn of phrase. The book explores the emotional expedition through the lens of the protagonist, Scott Ransom, who is trying to make meaning out of emotions as he juggles multiple relationships and looks for solace in adventures on his motorcycle.</p>
<p>The book, through Scott’s journey, showcases a realistic and emotional transformation, giving insights into how the mind and heart evolve and how emotional turmoil can affect an individual. Ryder paints an intense and vivid picture of the mental discourse that stirs up in a young man’s mind when faced with emotional challenges. As readers course through the pages, they will unravel how one can manage sentiment and regulate the actions and reactions that can impact interactions irreversibly. From romantic engagements to familial bonds, the literature can immerse young readers of drama and adventure into a voyage bubbling with effervescent and warm emotions that are seldom talked about.</p>
<p>Staged in the Blue Ridge Mountains, Walk Away mortalizes the rugged terrain, immersing and inviting readers into a landscape that can likely pique their wanderlust. Also, the writing has achieved the brilliant feat of giving a whole personality to the settings. The mountains and the adventurous landscape of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the surrounding areas have a tangible effect induced in Scott’s personality, which fortifies his characters as an adventurous spirit many readers might find a liking to. </p>
<p>Ryder has carefully cherry-picked the era for Walk Away, staging it in the 70s, and made use of the era’s social norms and cultural practices to discuss how the surroundings and society can impact the deepest, most private layers of an individual’s life.</p>
<p>Upon a deeper inspection of Walk Away, readers will be treated to subliminal symbolism that Ryder has carefully imbued in the story, which unravels as readers build relatability to the character, making the story a much more profound read than it might initially seem to be. Ryder has cautiously and smartly used simple elements like the protagonist’s motorcycle to express the most inward desires prodding on themes like one desire for freedom and escape and the challenges around it.</p>
<p>G.B. Ryder loves to investigate and explore the depths of raw and intense human emotions. He infuses the essence of real-life heroes and people he comes across in his characters, weaving stories that offer a tangibility of sentiments through his narrations. He adds a literary piquancy into his stories using descriptive and imaginative details of authentic locations, instilling a surreal and welcoming spirit of adventure, an essence that Ryder would gladly claim as his signature.</p>
<p>He lives in Alabama with his wife of 48 years and spends time reflecting on life, revisiting fond, old memories, and churning stories where he preserves his life’s adventures and experiences.</p>

<p>The film garnered huge press attention when their teaser trailer dropped on January 1st, 2024, on Simon Phillips’ personal YouTube account and has since been seen by millions of people worldwide.

<p>The film&#8217;s Director Jamie Bailey states &#8220;The Mouse Trap film is famously the first horror film to use the Mickey Mouse character from Steamboat Willie. We just wanted to have fun with it all. I mean it&#8217;s Steamboat Willie&#8217;s Mickey Mouse murdering people. It&#8217;s ridiculous. We ran with it and had fun doing it and I think it shows.&#8221; </p>
<p>The film stars Simon Phillips (THE WITCHER, FUBAR) as the titular villain, said of the film &#8220;We have a childlike excitement to show the world the film! We love the amazing work Walt Disney created here and we love the creative freedom the character coming into public domain provided. Fun. That&#8217;s what we had making it and what you will get watching it.&#8221; </p>

<p>In July of 2020, Salyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation experienced a profound loss with the passing of Keisha Joseph, a beloved caregiver who served the community for six years. Known for her compassion, empathy, and unwavering dedication, Keisha left a lasting impact on both residents and staff.</p>
<p>Tragically, Keisha passed away due to an underlying health condition. Her mother, Jamie Joseph, a health care professional who shares Keisha&#8217;s loving spirit, decided to ensure her daughter&#8217;s legacy would endure. She set up the organization known as “Keisha&#8217;s Korner,” which through community donations and a wave of support on social media raised over $5000 for the residents of Salyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation.</p>
<p>These funds were used to enhance the lives of residents providing Christmas gifts, tools for dementia care, and various other items. Touched by the generosity and the spirit of Keisha&#8217;s Korner, the staff and residents decided to create a special place within the facility to honor Keisha&#8217;s memory.</p>
<p>Salyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation is proud to unveil Keisha&#8217;s Korner, a new gathering lounge named after the organization. This space serves as a lasting tribute to Keisha, ensuring that her light continues to shine and her love for the residents is remembered forever.</p>
<p>“Once a member of the Salyersville nursing family, always a member,” said Administrator, Joshua Calhoun. “Keisha&#8217;s Korner is a testament to the enduring love and compassion Keisha brought to our community. It will always remind us of her dedication and the positive impact she had on all our lives. Keisha was a paragon of care and compassion towards those that she cared for in her role as a partner with us at Salyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation. I know that I echo the sentiments of those team members that worked with her when I say that we are proud to have this wonderful memorial and dedication to her in our community.”</p>
<p>For more information about Keisha’s Korner and how you can support this mission, please contact Salyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation, and ask to be connected to the activities department.</p>
<p>Salyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation offers skilled nursing care for both short and long-term patients.  Their private rehab rooms and excellent therapy make them the perfect choice to receive quality care close to home.</p>

<p>PORTO RAFTI, ATTIKI, GREECE, August 7, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; When Death Picks Favorites Sheds Light on the Human Side of the War</p>
<p>War impacts life unimaginably. It disrupts lives, shattering families and communities while inflicting deep emotional and psychological wounds. War also challenges moral boundaries, forcing individuals to confront ethical dilemmas and the dark specter of war crimes. When Death Picks Favorites by Lefteris Sakkas and Dimitra Iconomou is a book that might masquerade as a fictional tale but echoes reality at its core. Set against the backdrop of World War II, the book takes the readers into the lives of Antonis Krallis, a Greek-American service member, and Kurt Weinhardt, a sergeant in the Waffen SS. </p>
<p>Amid the chaos of life and death on the battlefield, both characters find themselves on an emotional journey that conveys the impact of war on the human psyche. Their silent encounter is the culmination of the reality of war, something that doesn&#8217;t make it to the headlines. </p>
<p>When Death Picks Favorites sheds light on some lesser-known facts on both sides of the conflict. It takes readers to untold stories that unfold in the shadows of war, exploring themes such as PTSD, survivor&#8217;s guilt, and the haunting specter of war crimes.</p>
<p>As readers delve into this captivating story, they discover that even in the darkest corners of history, the indomitable human spirit can illuminate a path toward resilience, redemption, and enduring hope.</p>
<p>When Death Picks Favorites is available in English, translated by Dimitra Iconomou, and Spanish on Amazon to reach a broader audience.</p>
<p>About the Authors:<br />Lefteris Sakkas, a registered nurse at a psychiatric facility, brings a unique perspective to his writing, drawing on his experiences working with trauma survivors. &#8220;When Death Picks Favorites&#8221; is his second novel translated into English.</p>
<p>Dimitra Iconomou, based in California, is a Certified Translation Professional and Greek copy editor, making her literary translation debut with this novel. She also serves as Mr. Sakkas&#8217;s literary manager in the United States.</p>
