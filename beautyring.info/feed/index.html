<p>In July of 2020, Salyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation experienced a profound loss with the passing of Keisha Joseph, a beloved caregiver who served the community for six years. Known for her compassion, empathy, and unwavering dedication, Keisha left a lasting impact on both residents and staff.</p>
<p>Tragically, Keisha passed away due to an underlying health condition. Her mother, Jamie Joseph, a health care professional who shares Keisha&#8217;s loving spirit, decided to ensure her daughter&#8217;s legacy would endure. She set up the organization known as “Keisha&#8217;s Korner,” which through community donations and a wave of support on social media raised over $5000 for the residents of Salyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation.</p>
<p>These funds were used to enhance the lives of residents providing Christmas gifts, tools for dementia care, and various other items. Touched by the generosity and the spirit of Keisha&#8217;s Korner, the staff and residents decided to create a special place within the facility to honor Keisha&#8217;s memory.</p>
<p>Salyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation is proud to unveil Keisha&#8217;s Korner, a new gathering lounge named after the organization. This space serves as a lasting tribute to Keisha, ensuring that her light continues to shine and her love for the residents is remembered forever.</p>
<p>“Once a member of the Salyersville nursing family, always a member,” said Administrator, Joshua Calhoun. “Keisha&#8217;s Korner is a testament to the enduring love and compassion Keisha brought to our community. It will always remind us of her dedication and the positive impact she had on all our lives. Keisha was a paragon of care and compassion towards those that she cared for in her role as a partner with us at Salyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation. I know that I echo the sentiments of those team members that worked with her when I say that we are proud to have this wonderful memorial and dedication to her in our community.”</p>
<p>For more information about Keisha’s Korner and how you can support this mission, please contact Salyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation, and ask to be connected to the activities department.</p>
<p>Salyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation offers skilled nursing care for both short and long-term patients.  Their private rehab rooms and excellent therapy make them the perfect choice to receive quality care close to home.</p>

<p>PORTO RAFTI, ATTIKI, GREECE, August 7, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; When Death Picks Favorites Sheds Light on the Human Side of the War</p>
<p>War impacts life unimaginably. It disrupts lives, shattering families and communities while inflicting deep emotional and psychological wounds. War also challenges moral boundaries, forcing individuals to confront ethical dilemmas and the dark specter of war crimes. When Death Picks Favorites by Lefteris Sakkas and Dimitra Iconomou is a book that might masquerade as a fictional tale but echoes reality at its core. Set against the backdrop of World War II, the book takes the readers into the lives of Antonis Krallis, a Greek-American service member, and Kurt Weinhardt, a sergeant in the Waffen SS. </p>
<p>Amid the chaos of life and death on the battlefield, both characters find themselves on an emotional journey that conveys the impact of war on the human psyche. Their silent encounter is the culmination of the reality of war, something that doesn&#8217;t make it to the headlines. </p>
<p>When Death Picks Favorites sheds light on some lesser-known facts on both sides of the conflict. It takes readers to untold stories that unfold in the shadows of war, exploring themes such as PTSD, survivor&#8217;s guilt, and the haunting specter of war crimes.</p>
<p>As readers delve into this captivating story, they discover that even in the darkest corners of history, the indomitable human spirit can illuminate a path toward resilience, redemption, and enduring hope.</p>
<p>When Death Picks Favorites is available in English, translated by Dimitra Iconomou, and Spanish on Amazon to reach a broader audience.</p>
<p>About the Authors:<br />Lefteris Sakkas, a registered nurse at a psychiatric facility, brings a unique perspective to his writing, drawing on his experiences working with trauma survivors. &#8220;When Death Picks Favorites&#8221; is his second novel translated into English.</p>
<p>Dimitra Iconomou, based in California, is a Certified Translation Professional and Greek copy editor, making her literary translation debut with this novel. She also serves as Mr. Sakkas&#8217;s literary manager in the United States.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bitcoin &#8211; Risk-On, Risk-Off! Bitcoin, the leaderless leader leading the tumbling price in cryptocurrencies today. Seems when the sentiment moves towards protecting capital by reducing exposure to risk, both traders and investors are quick to dump their Bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gillings&#8217; insights come at a time when Bitcoin has experienced a significant decline, shedding over 20% of its value in the past month alone. The cryptocurrency, which had seen a meteoric rise over the past few years, is now facing increased scrutiny from investors concerned about its stability and long-term viability.</p>

The show has captivated audiences with its gripping portrayal of financial intrigue and the complex characters navigating this volatile landscape.

<p>BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, August 7, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; Lace Layer, a Black woman-owned lace wig product company based in Boston, is proud to celebrate Small Black Business Month by sharing its inspiring journey of innovation, resilience, and community engagement.</p>

<p>BIRMINGHAM, UK, August 5, 2024 /<a rel="noopener external noreferrer sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.einpresswire.com/" dir="auto" data-wpel-link="external">EINPresswire.com</a>/ &#8212; TFNation 2024, will take place this weekend,  August 9th to the 11th at the Hilton Birmingham Metropole, in Birmingham, UK. TFNation is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the world’s favorite transforming robots. This year, the convention, on course to be Europe’s largest ever Transformers fan convention, is set to feature the only voice star to be inducted into the Transformer’s Hall of Fame for his portrayal of both Optimus Prime AND Megatron, Mr. David Kaye.</p>
<p>Kaye, renowned for his deep, commanding voice brought the character to life, making Megatron one of the most memorable villains in animation history. Kaye continued his evil streak in the Unicron Trilogy series, voicing Megatron and Galvatron in Armada, Energon, and Cybertron.</p>
<p>In 2007, Kaye demonstrated his versatility by switching sides and voicing the heroic Autobot leader, Optimus Prime, in the fan-favorite series Transformers: Animated. His ability to embody both the franchise&#8217;s most formidable villain and its noble hero speaks to his exceptional range as a voice actor.</p>
<p>Kaye&#8217;s contributions to the Transformers universe didn’t stop there. He has also voiced characters like Lugnut, Grimlock, and Warpath in Transformers: Animated, Hardshell in Transformers: Prime, and Hammerstrike and Slashmark in Robots in Disguise. No matter when you became a Transformers fan, chances are you&#8217;ve heard David Kaye&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>Beyond the world of Transformers, Kaye has an extraordinary resume that includes Marvel’s Eternals as Arishem, Andy Samberg’s new TV series Digman as Howard Toe, Sesshomaru in Inuyasha and YashaHime, Trieze  Khushrenada in Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, Grandpa Max in Ben 10, Battle Cat/Cringer in Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&#8221;, Multiple guest stars in Teen Titans Go! As well as Vandal Savage in DC Super Friends, Young Justice,  X-Men: Evolution as Professor X, and one of the world’s most adored tiny robots Clank in Sony/ Insomniac Games’ renowned “Ratchet &amp; Clank” franchise. David is also widely recognized as the voice narrator for HBO’s Emmy-winning Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. </p>
