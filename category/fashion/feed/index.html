He humanizes it by enhancing meanings and emotions that vary between anger, calmness, hope, optimism, and strength, showcased in 42 (45) pieces ranging from haute couture dresses, suits, jumpsuits, and abayas, in addition to a stunning wedding dress.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Designer&nbsp;<em>Robert Abi Nader</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>weaves the dresses with his personal vision based on presenting women as delicate and strong at the same time, attractive and elegant. This is embodied in body-hugging dress models that add a touch of femininity to the designs, avoiding loose designs to maintain the identity of each body independently, helped by the quality of sensitive and bold fabrics.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">&nbsp;Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Van Gogh's</em>&nbsp;line, based on blending elements in tailoring, is enhanced. He used various cuts in fabric, especially in pants, blouses, or jackets, making the designs look like impressionist paintings, unified in elements and harmonious in details. He used the corset in the collection within several models and dresses, choosing the corset in the chest area from iron, wood, or plastic, and incorporated leather in four pieces as an extension of the previous collection.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><em>Van Gogh's</em>&nbsp;visual vision also appeared in the color palette he adopted, derived from natural conditions. The designs appeared in orange and gold colors, giving the look luxury with its connotations, and the colors "lilac" and "lemon blue," and grassy green, as well as black. Each represents an element of nature with its psychological symbolism, where bright colors show meanings of joy and dedication, radiant colors symbolize light and hope, and life colors like green symbolize resilience and continuity.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The wedding dress, adopted by designer&nbsp;<em>Robert Abi Nader</em>&nbsp;in "off white," was given a part of the personal vision of dream day perceptions by adding luxury to it through golden embroidery.&nbsp;<em>Van Gogh'</em>s vision is enhanced in its details, to weave hope and future in an elegant and charming design.</p><p><strong>Runway Looks</strong></p><p><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_001_1719659757.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 001 1719659757 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_002_1719659761.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 002 1719659761 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_003_1719659764.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 003 1719659764 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_004_1719659767.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 004 1719659767 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_005_1719659769.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 005 1719659769 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_006_1719659772.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 006 1719659772 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_007_1719659775.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 007 1719659775 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_008_1719659778.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 008 1719659778 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_009_1719659780.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 009 1719659780 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_010_1719659783.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 010 1719659783 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_011_1719659786.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 011 1719659786 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_012_1719659790.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 012 1719659790 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_013_1719659792.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 013 1719659792 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_014_1719659795.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 014 1719659795 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_015_1719659798.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 015 1719659798 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_016_1719659800.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 016 1719659800 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_017_1719659804.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 017 1719659804 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_018_1719659806.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 018 1719659806 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_019_1719659809.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 019 1719659809 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_020_1719659812.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 020 1719659812 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_021_1719659814.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 021 1719659814 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_022_1719659816.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 022 1719659816 jpg"></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Photo: Press </span>Robert Abi Nader</p><p>More on: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/robertabinader/" rel="noopener noreferrer external sponsored nofollow" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@robertabinader</a></p><p><br></p><p>By Senior Fashion Editor <a href="https://24fashion.tv/" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank">24FashionTV</a>:&nbsp;<a href="https://24fashion.tv/user/profile/UdWRw6T0e3aPZL16XSMO0SH6mpm1/christina-henningstad" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" style="color: rgb(210, 145, 15);" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank">Christina V Henningstad</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/christina_henningstad/" rel="noopener noreferrer external sponsored nofollow" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@christina_henningstad</a></p><p><br></p><p>The post <a href="https://beautyring.info/fashion/robert-abi-nader-couture-fw25-during-paris-haute-couture-week/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">ROBERT ABI NADER COUTURE FW25 during Paris Haute Couture Week</a> first appeared on <a href="https://beautyring.info" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Beauty Ring Magazine</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Each piece is an ode to the complexity of human emotions, capturing the duality between darkness and light, nostalgia and beauty.</p><p>In a world where emotions are often masked by noise and light, the collection plunges us into the heart of the human soul. Entirely crafted in black, each creation embodies the depth of melancholy, a complex and introspective emotion that reveals a rare and sublime beauty.</p><p>Melancholia transcends the ephemeral trends of fashion to offer a timeless experience, where each piece is designed as a work of art. The dark fabrics, architectural cuts, and delicate details tell a story of nostalgia and contemplation, capturing the essence of beauty with unparalleled elegance.</p><p>The collection is composed of silk gazar, silk organza, duchess satin, Calais lace, brocade, and silk crepe. Notable is the exceptional work of feather artisans who adorned the looks with rooster, goose, and ostrich feathers. All the embroideries are handmade.</p><p>In homage to poetic solitude, Lena Erziak invites us to embrace our deepest feelings and find light in the darkness. By celebrating its Melancholia, the house attempts to redefine the codes of beauty and seeks to make us reflect on the importance of emotion in our existence.</p><p><strong>Runway Looks</strong></p><p><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_001_1719576151.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 001 1719576151 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_002_1719576155.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 002 1719576155 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_003_1719576158.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 003 1719576158 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_004_1719576161.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 004 1719576161 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_005_1719576164.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 005 1719576164 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_006_1719576167.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 006 1719576167 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_007_1719576170.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 007 1719576170 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_008_1719576172.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 008 1719576172 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_009_1719576175.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 009 1719576175 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_010_1719576178.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 010 1719576178 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_011_1719576181.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 011 1719576181 jpg"></p><p>Photo: Press <span style="color: rgb(29, 29, 29);">LENA ERZIAK</span></p><p>More on: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lena_erziak/" rel="noopener noreferrer external sponsored nofollow" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@lena_erziak</a></p><p><br></p><p>By Senior Fashion Editor <a href="https://24fashion.tv/" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank">24FashionTV</a>:&nbsp;<a href="https://24fashion.tv/user/profile/UdWRw6T0e3aPZL16XSMO0SH6mpm1/christina-henningstad" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" style="color: rgb(210, 145, 15);" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank">Christina V Henningstad</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/christina_henningstad/" rel="noopener noreferrer external sponsored nofollow" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@christina_henningstad</a></p><p>The post <a href="https://beautyring.info/fashion/lena-erziak-fw25-during-paris-haute-couture-week/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">LENA ERZIAK FW25 during Paris Haute Couture Week</a> first appeared on <a href="https://beautyring.info" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Beauty Ring Magazine</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The meticulous quality transcends circumstances and appeals to all generations. The Woman is placed at the center of the garment, which is enhanced by her movement and attitude.</p><p>Always focused on elegance and inventiveness, the Belgian designer has reinterpreted classic forms, played with light, infused the unexpected, and imagined a new brilliance. Combining the richness of basic materials with coated fabrics for shine and airy wools to anchor winter pieces over time, the Maison has transformed precious fabrics. For instance, a shirtdress in organza with a back neckline, worn with fuchsia wool and silk trousers and semi-gloss aubergine long gloves, and an iconic mohair evening dress, warm up modern occasions.</p><p>Becauseevenincomfort,Couturerequiresstructure,EdouardVermeulenemphasizesintricate constructions this season, with high-waisted flat-pleated pants, chiffon pants dancing around the legs. Below-the-knee lengths mix with short pieces, to be harmonized with large, elegant coats. A hat embroidered with translucent pearls offers a cinematic presence, while full skirts cinched at the waist create new volumes for an impactful narrative. A black organza cape dress creates a sensation, as does a draped bustier resembling a winged statue, imprinting the retina and holding it: one possesses the space by the grace of a rare knit sculpture. The materials juxtapose and enrich each other; we discover black in the collection, high-prestige leather in the presence for elegantly refined dresses, and always the timeless aesthetic of a worked minimalism.</p><p>The materials are precious, but to vary the originalities, a graphic satin top is mixed with a long sheath skirt in shantung silk, a short silk taffeta dress with an embroidered cape, a four-pocket neoprene suit with bent sleeves and a crystal belt. The Maison innovates again with double-faced silks, crepes, and chiffons, assertive colors. This collection interprets lacquered textures and tangy tones (neon apple, black violet, ripe cherry, and fuchsia pink) mixed with black or navy blue, delicately placed or contrasted with the purity of snow white.</p><p>The fabrics come to life differently depending on the cut and draping, each piece dialogues with the body, and Couture offers a new experience, an adventure.</p><p><strong>Looks</strong></p><p><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_001_1719570088.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 001 1719570088 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_002_1719570091.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 002 1719570091 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_003_1719570095.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 003 1719570095 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_004_1719570098.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 004 1719570098 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_005_1719570101.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 005 1719570101 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_006_1719570104.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 006 1719570104 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_007_1719570108.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 007 1719570108 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_008_1719570111.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 008 1719570111 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_009_1719570114.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 009 1719570114 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_010_1719570117.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 010 1719570117 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_011_1719570120.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 011 1719570120 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_012_1719570124.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 012 1719570124 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_013_1719570128.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 013 1719570128 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_014_1719570131.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 014 1719570131 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_015_1719570134.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 015 1719570134 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_NATAN_FW24_LOOK_016_1719570136.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV NATAN FW24 LOOK 016 1719570136 jpg"></p><p>Photo: Press <span style="color: rgb(29, 29, 29);">Maison NATAN</span></p><p>More on: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/natancouture/" rel="noopener noreferrer external sponsored nofollow" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@natancouture</a></p><p><br></p><p>By Senior Fashion Editor <a href="https://24fashion.tv/" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank">24FashionTV</a>:&nbsp;<a href="https://24fashion.tv/user/profile/UdWRw6T0e3aPZL16XSMO0SH6mpm1/christina-henningstad" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" style="color: rgb(210, 145, 15);" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank">Christina V Henningstad</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/christina_henningstad/" rel="noopener noreferrer external sponsored nofollow" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@christina_henningstad</a></p><p>The post <a href="https://beautyring.info/fashion/maison-natan-couture-fw25-during-paris-haute-couture-week/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Maison NATAN COUTURE FW25 during Paris Haute Couture Week</a> first appeared on <a href="https://beautyring.info" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Beauty Ring Magazine</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A series of iconic recycled black velvet dresses are reborn in a new present, on the one hand treasures of the Paris Opra and on the other witnesses to the artistic history and savoir faire of haute couture that they embody for AELIS.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">A graphic long-sleeved black velvet silhouette contemporary transposition of the pale Madame X , painted by John Sargent, is accompanied by an asymmetrical tattoo necklace created by Les Interessants in black micro crystal beads. A Renaissance-shaped jacket made of black velvet is adorned with a delicate weave of fine gold and silver chains, a unique and wonderful piece also by Les Interessants.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Antique lace and silver organza embroidery delicately placed on a black and white Chantilly tank top dress contrasts with a sleeveless tunic of eco-conscious mohair wool .</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Inspired by light and luminescence, AELIS collaborates with PolyU and the Professor Kinor Jiang's team to develop a  green project where precious metals such as gold and silver</p><p class="ql-align-justify">are laid on delicate organic silk organza.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">"Sustainable Lectures," a series of meetings on sustainable fashion jointly organized in Hong Kong by the French consulate and PolyU, where AELIS had been invited to share its vision of eco-sustainable fashion, allowed Sofia to meet with PolyU and RIO, research and innovation department of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University , at the origin of the cutting age research project .</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The high-tech green technology developed by PolyU involves using a magnetron sputtering coating to place ultra-thin, nano-scale metallic films on textile fibers without additives and without discharging polluted water or chemicals into the environment.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The wonderful result appears in some of the dresses made for the collection and offers Sofia the opportunity to showcase very precious, air-light fabrics whose silk fibers are delicately coated with particles of Gold and Silver.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">A pyramid-shaped sculpted silver organza dress supported by a bustier creates a silhouette characterized by cones of light.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">A cascade of vintage black feathers structures an gold ball gown skirt and in the same volume a dress is created by an oversized gold organza skirt and a double ruffle serving as a bodice.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">An asymmetrical gold organza tunic is covered with evanescent silk embroidery recovered on an incredibly treasured silver embroidered gown from 1924 .</p><p class="ql-align-justify">AELIS Models and Muses show the collection in a white Gallery immersed in a " Kubrickian " atmosphere created by Pierre Bnard where, unique works of precious contemporary design and Roman antiques are placed on the white floor under zenithal light creating a timeless dimension.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">For AELIS and its commitment to an eco-conscious future, the prestigious upcycling partenariat with Opra de Paris and the green high-tech collaboration with PolyU, are a beautiful example of a joint and multicultural effort to change the future

Good at writing, literary and favoring romance, these elements are paid tribute to in the design with a unique artistic aesthetic, and each silhouette element demonstrates the studio's superior skills.In this new collection, the brand's most iconic custom embroidered regular dresses are maintained, while the dress poncho incorporates architecture in the silhouette design, adding a new dimension to each piece not only for comfort, but also to better showcase the divine vibe.</p><p>Throughout the collection, a very special tribute to women's classic looks is included, where the brand pays special tribute to some of the representatives of women who have benefited society, including Sister Theresa, Queen Elizabeth II, Waris Diiriye, the Desert Flower, Mozah Bint Nasser Al-Missned, Princess of Qatar, Empress Wu Zetian of China, and Hypatia, the Ancient Egyptian Mathematician and Astronomer.The Astronomer Hypatia.</p><p>The show's music gives people the feeling of healing the soul, originating from the Chinese sound law "five tones enter the five viscera", Chinese medicine "Nei Jing" will be horn, zheng, Gong, Shang, Yu belong to wood, fire, earth, gold, water, so the five tones and the five viscera, there is "five viscera phonological" theory, that is, the sound of Gong into theThe theory of the "five visceral sounds" is that the Gong sound goes to the spleen, the Shang sound goes to the lungs, the Horn sound goes to the liver, the Zheng sound goes to the heart and the Feather sound goes to the kidney.</p><p>Special mention should be made of the show's arched roof made of 1,400 pieces of wood, designed by the famous French architect R. Farradche in 1924, the monumental building is classified as a national monument, coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the Paris Olympics, the show also coincides with the 100th birthday of the club, which only invites a very small number of members.As with the Homolog brand, the positioning is high-end, with the intention of providing unlimited services to a limited group.Including advanced customized modification of precious old clothes, so that after many years can still wear her original beauty, advocating people to seriously live seriously love, so that time becomes a good friend, so that the wisdom and classic continuation.</p><p><strong>Runway Looks</strong></p><p><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_001_1719517585.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 001 1719517585 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_002_1719517588.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 002 1719517588 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_003_1719517591.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 003 1719517591 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_004_1719517594.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 004 1719517594 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_005_1719517596.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 005 1719517596 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_006_1719517600.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 006 1719517600 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_007_1719517602.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 007 1719517602 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_008_1719517605.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 008 1719517605 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_009_1719517608.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 009 1719517608 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_010_1719517611.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 010 1719517611 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_011_1719517614.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 011 1719517614 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_012_1719517617.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 012 1719517617 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_013_1719517621.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 013 1719517621 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_014_1719517624.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 014 1719517624 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_015_1719517627.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 015 1719517627 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_016_1719517630.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 016 1719517630 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_017_1719517633.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 017 1719517633 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_018_1719517635.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 018 1719517635 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_019_1719517638.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 019 1719517638 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_020_1719517641.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 020 1719517641 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_021_1719517644.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 021 1719517644 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_022_1719517648.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 022 1719517648 jpg"><img src="https://s3.wasabisys.com/24fashion/article_photos/24Fashion_TV_023_1719517650.jpg" alt="24Fashion TV 023 1719517650 jpg"></p><p>Photo: Press <span style="color: rgb(29, 29, 29);">Homolog</span></p><p>More on: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/homologofficial/" rel="noopener noreferrer external sponsored nofollow" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@homologofficial</a></p><p><br></p><p>By Senior Fashion Editor <a href="https://24fashion.tv/" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank">24FashionTV</a>:&nbsp;<a href="https://24fashion.tv/user/profile/UdWRw6T0e3aPZL16XSMO0SH6mpm1/christina-henningstad" rel="noopener noreferrer follow" style="color: rgb(210, 145, 15);" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank">Christina V Henningstad</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/christina_henningstad/" rel="noopener noreferrer external sponsored nofollow" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@christina_henningstad</a></p><p><br></p><p>The post <a href="https://beautyring.info/fashion/homolog-couture-fw25-during-paris-haute-couture-week/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Homolog Couture FW25 during Paris Haute Couture Week</a> first appeared on <a href="https://beautyring.info" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow">Beauty Ring Magazine</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
