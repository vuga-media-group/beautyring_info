Revenue from Legacy-Huazhu was <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB7.9 billion<\/span>, which represented a 67.7% year-over-year increase. Revenue from Steigenberger Hotels GmbH and its subsidiaries (&#8220;<b>DH<\/b>&#8220;, or &#8220;<b>Legacy-DH<\/b>&#8220;) was <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB2.1 billion<\/span>, representing a 55.9% year-over-year increase.<\/p>\n<p>H World&#8217;s Hotel turnover increased significantly by 72.0% year-over-year to <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB20.3 billion<\/span> in the second quarter of 2023. Excluding DH, hotel turnover raised to 78.1% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2023. Revenue increased 63.5% year-over-year to <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB5.5 billion<\/span> (<span class=\"xn-money\">US$762 million<\/span>). Revenue from the Legacy-Huazhu was <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB4.3 billion<\/span>, representing a 76.6% year-over-year increase, which was a result of the strong recovery in demand for travel, as well as due to the continued product upgrades and operational optimization via the Group&#8217;s regional headquarters. Revenue growth for both the Group and Legacy-Huazhu exceeded the revenue guidance previously announced. Revenue from the DH segment was <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB1.2 billion<\/span>, representing a 28.4% year-over-year increase and a 33.5% sequential increase. The year-over-year increase was largely due to the continued recovery of the Group&#8217;s business, and the sequential increase was mainly due to seasonality. Net income attributable to H World was <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB1.0 billion<\/span> (<span class=\"xn-money\">US$138 million<\/span>), compared with net losses attributable to H World of <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB350 million<\/span> in the second quarter of 2022.

Legacy-Huazhu had 8,622 hotels in operation and 818,245 hotel rooms in operation. In the second quarter of 2023, Legacy-Huazhu celebrated a historical high signing of over 1,000 new hotels. The ADR was <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB305<\/span>, compared with <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB218<\/span> in the second quarter of 2022, <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB277<\/span> in the previous quarter, and <span class=\"xn-money\">RMB236<\/span> in the second quarter of 2019.

Continued increases in our franchisees&#8217; confidence level led us to enjoy a historical high of new hotels signed during the quarter. Regarding our overseas business, our DH business recovery improved sequentially, and EBITDA turned positive in the second quarter.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As a leading player in the hotel industry in <span class=\"xn-location\">China<\/span> and one of the fastest-growing hotel groups in the world, H World has achieved its RevPAR growth momentum by consistently upgrading its brands and services, helping the Group to recover from uncertainty and maintain its rapid growth.
