As a special focus, this third season is dedicated to dialogues on religious worldviews. In order to realize this project, the producers have invited representatives from various faith and belief systems to share their individual perspectives and practices; with a particular emphasis on ushering in a new era of well-being. Included with this new season of programs is a truly extraordinary conversation on the Catholic faith with the Benedictine monk and Catholic Priest, Father Laurence Freeman.<br \/>\nWith Irish and English roots, Laurence Freeman was educated by the Benedictines and studied English Literature at New College, Oxford University. Before entering monastic life, he worked with the United Nations in New York, in Banking and Journalism. He is Director of The World Community for Christian Meditation (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/wccm.org\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">WCCM<\/a>) a global, inclusive contemplative community. Fr. Laurence Freeman is a monk of the Benedictine Congregation of Monte Oliveto Maggiore.<\/p>\n<p>During this conversation, Father Laurence and podcast hosts Ervin Laszlo and Frederick Chavalit Tsao, and moderator Nora Csiszar, delved into a variety of topics concerning the Catholic faith and the modern world; in particular vis-\u00e0-vis the sciences and relationships with other faith traditions\u2014all of this with the ultimate goal of building a better world through collaboration rather than competition.<\/p>\n<p>Of particular interest is Father Laurence\u2019s deep practices in meditation and knowledge on Christian mysticism. He speaks of the need to understand religion, which can be conceived as having three aspects, those being: the institutional, or structural and organizational aspects; the  intellectual, which acknowledges that there is an experience at the heart of religion and that human mind has an instinctive impulse to understand; the third element is the mystical which he feels is of great importance because without it religion will degenerate and stagnate, and potentially become oppressive. As he states during this discussion:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd these three elements have to be nurtured, and the one that most often gets marginalized is the mystical. And when that happens\u2026religion fails. It fails what it is destined to contribute to humanity, and that is a sense of really linking\u2014the word \u2018religion\u2019 of course means religare (Latin, \u201cbinding\u201d)\u2014to remember the links, the bonds, of unity that we have not only with each other as a human family, across all our differences, but also with the world of nature, and the cosmos, and with God.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>So it is based upon meditation and mysticism that Father Laurence posits both his efforts at interfaith dialogue, and a reconciliation of science and faith. Regarding science and faith, he paraphrases the Catholic priest and theoretical physicist, Georges Lemaitre who spoke of religion and science being highly complementary means of investigating the truth. Lemaitre pointed out that science is a contemplative activity, similar to religious meditation in that it demonstrates a great deal of humility in that the more it knows, the more it realizes how much it does not know; it is driven the experience of discovery, a childlike impulse for exploration; and finally it has sense of service at its core, for all of humanity. <\/p>\n<p>A lasting testament to Father Laurence\u2019s dedication to interfaith dialogue is his collaboration with the Dalai Lama, which includes the 1996 publication A Good Heart which describes with incredible insight was a Buddhist perspective on the teachings of Jesus. <\/p>\n<p>The Dawn of an Era of Well-Being podcast is co-production of the Laszlo Institute of New Paradigm Research (LINPR), The <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.octaveinstitute.com\/en\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">OCTAVE<\/a> Institute Quantum Leadership Center, and SelectBooks publishers.
