The property features a <span>casino<\/span> including 86 new slot machines, a full-service restaurant and bar with craft cocktails, a delicious new menu, and music memorabilia. The on-site Rock Shop will also sport custom Rocksino by Hard Rock Deadwood apparel. Beautifully renovated luxury guest rooms are scheduled to open later this year.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Hard Rock prides itself on being able to provide authentic and memorable experiences for our guests embodied by music and rich cultural history,&#8221; said <span class=\"xn-person\">Jon Lucas<\/span>, Chief Operating Officer at Hard Rock International. &#8220;We are thrilled to become a part of one of the most celebrated historic places in the U.S. and provide an economic stimulus to the city of <span class=\"xn-location\">Deadwood<\/span>.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"xn-location\">Deadwood<\/span> Mayor <span class=\"xn-person\">David Ruth<\/span> lauded Rocksino partners, <span class=\"xn-person\">Steve Slowey<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-person\">Marc Oswald<\/span> for bringing the Hard Rock brand to one of the most celebrated Wild West towns in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As a community famous for entertaining guests since 1876, <span class=\"xn-location\">Deadwood<\/span> is excited to welcome Rocksino by Hard Rock Deadwood as our newest, can&#8217;t-miss property,&#8221; said Mayor Ruth. &#8220;Our rich, Old West history combined with the Hard Rock brand will enhance the <span class=\"xn-location\">Deadwood<\/span> experience for which we are known for.

But, as Big Kenny of the country music duo Big &amp; Rich explained, &#8220;These were not real guitars, but <span class=\"xn-location\">Hollywood<\/span> prop guitars.
