Dr. Brandon Ryff, a restorative and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scottsdalesmile.com\/about\/cosmetic-dentist-ryff-phoenix-az\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">cosmetic dentist in Scottsdale<\/a>, and his fellow dentists at Scottsdale Smile Center offer BOTOX<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> injections for dental aesthetic enhancement procedures*, bruxism, and TMD. He says the treatment has proven to be very effective in all of those applications for many patients at his practice. <\/p>\n<p>Dr. Ryff along with Dr. Jonathan Coombs, Dr. Don Chiappetti, and Dr. Reed Chiappetti are all certified by the American Academy of Facial Esthetics to perform BOTOX<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> injections for patients looking to renew their appearance. The BOTOX<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> Cosmetic solution is what is known as a neuromodulator\u2014it is composed of a purified form of botulinum toxin type-A, which can temporarily prevent muscles from contracting. This muscle contracture is often what is responsible for dynamic wrinkle formation in certain areas of the face. When BOTOX<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> Cosmetic is injected directly into areas of skin and muscle around the corners of the eyes, between the brows, or along the forehead, it can diminish signs of creases and fine lines in those regions with results that last about three to four months for most patients. Dr. Ryff says occasional follow-up treatments can help individuals maintain the effects for even longer periods. Additionally, he says the dentists at the practice utilize the Comfortox syringe for all of their BOTOX<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> injections, which is designed specifically for facial aesthetic treatments. <\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, Dr. Ryff explains that the BOTOX<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> methodology also lends itself well to providing relief for many patients who have conditions related to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), which is the connector between the upper and lower jaws. Overactive muscles surrounding the joint can be the cause of TMJ Disorder, which can produce symptoms such as jaw pain, jaw clicking\/popping, difficulty chewing, headaches, and many others. These same overactive muscles can also contribute to the persistent teeth clenching and grinding that is characteristic of bruxism, which can ultimately damage the teeth and lead to other major concerns. Dr. Ryff says <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.scottsdalesmile.com\/advanced\/botox-xeomin-injections-tmj-bruxism\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">BOTOX<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> for TMD and bruxism<\/a> utilizes a similar technique as BOTOX<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> injections for dental aesthetics\u2014the solution is injected directly into the targeted muscle in the treatment area to reduce its hyperactivity. Ultimately, Dr. Ryff notes, this process can diminish numerous symptoms associated with TMD and bruxism for many patients. <\/p>\n<p>According to Dr. Ryff, it is important to note that BOTOX<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> injections are not the ideal treatment for every patient. He says individuals should always seek a qualified and reputable provider for an evaluation to determine whether their unique anatomical needs and goals make them a good candidate for the procedure. Particularly in cases of TMJ Disorder and bruxism, Dr. Ryff says there are also alternative options that can be explored in case BOTOX<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> may not be the most optimal solution. He advises patients considering these types of treatments to thoroughly research potential providers in their area, meet with the doctor to evaluate their rapport, and make sure that all of their questions and concerns are addressed before agreeing to receive treatment. <\/p>\n<p>*Arizona state regulations require injectable treatments performed for the purposes of cosmetic enhancement at a dental practice to be associated with a dental treatment plan. They also stipulate that the person who is receiving the treatment must be a dental patient of record. <\/p>\n<p>About Scottsdale Smile Center <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nScottsdale Smile Center is a comprehensive dental practice offering a wide selection of general, cosmetic, and restorative dental care options.
