This new clause, which we hope will be included in all actors\u2019 deal memos going forward, will ensure inclusive strides around hair and makeup services are made. This clause marks just the beginning of our work in this space. We also need to expand the pool of hairstylists and makeup artists who are proficient in working with diverse skin tones and hair types\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Lashana Lynch says:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBeing expected to perform at our best when we as Black artists do not have the same support in hair and makeup as our non-Black and brown peers, is a load that can be heavy to carry as an artist. This load must be shared. I\u2019m hugely supportive of this campaign to address this discrimination ensuring an equitable work environment on and off set for all. I\u2019ll continue to raise this until the framework within our industries are built for everyone to win.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Rabbatts continues: \u201cand we are delighted to see the essential Sky documentary Untold Stories: Hair On Set, co-directed by Fola Evans-Akinbola and Jordan Pitt screening in Cannes, is further raising awareness of this issue. The documentary follows Fola and friends including Naomie Harris and others, as they discuss the challenges Black talent face working in TV and film.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Fola Evans-Akingbola says:<\/p>\n<p>It is incredibly exciting to know that Time&#8217;s Up UK is turning its attention to the topic of hair and makeup equality in our industry. This is a subject that impacts so many of us and this collective push towards progress is what has been needed for a long time. Untold Stories: Hair on Set was an invitation to the industry to go on a learning journey about Afro textured hair in order to explore how something as seemingly superficial as having one&#8217;s hair done is in fact the key to understanding ideas such as race, identity and belonging. I&#8217;m honoured that the documentary has become one part of the collective effort towards change, and I&#8217;m thrilled to support the campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Naomie Harris says: <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe last thing you want to be thinking about as you prepare in character before going on set is your hair. Hair and makeup discrimination is a persistent and unspoken issue which causes harm. I am delighted to support Time\u2019s Up UK and partners in their campaign to raise awareness of this inequality in our industry and to find ways to ensure that there are professionals on set that can support everyone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jordan Pitt, Co-Director, Untold Stories: Hair on Set, for Sky Documentaries, says:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that we are having to endure such issues in 2024.  Being one of the directors on Untold Stories: Hair on Set, which highlighted the issue of discrimination on film sets for Black actors, I am thrilled to support this campaign that will push for the much-needed change within the industry and beyond.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The PMA Diverse Squad says, \u201cIn 2021 we carried out a survey for the Sir Lenny Henry Media Centre for Media Diversity who published the findings in a report, Actors\u2019 Experience of Race and Racism in Britain\u2019s Audition and Casting Process and On Set. Our findings revealed the institutional racism performers of colour continue to face in the pursuit of their careers. The survey revealed specific issues around hair and makeup and the inability to speak up against the racist practices encountered while working, 71% of respondents had experienced hair or makeup artists who lacked the knowledge to work with them on an equal basis to their white co- workers. We urge all those involved in actors\u2019 contract negotiations to include this new clause as a first step to giving voice and attention to this issue.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Akua Gyamfi, Founder, British Blacklist, says, \u201cAs a former hairdresser who has worked with Black female actors, models and performers the importance of having someone on set who understands how to work with afro hair and has sensitivity toward Black women&#8217;s beauty in these spaces is so important. Now as the founder of The British Blacklist and the many conversations I&#8217;m still having about the lack of representation in the Hair &amp; Makeup department is shocking and infuriating which is why I&#8217;m throwing complete support behind this campaign\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Ade Rawcliffe, Board Director, Time\u2019s Up UK and Group of Diversity and Inclusion at ITV says, \u201cFor too long, we have not advocated strongly enough the need for our workspaces to represent all members of our society, and for all workers to have an equal opportunity to enter the entertainment industry. We look forward to working with our industry partners and the PMA Diverse Squad to enact change and make the industry inclusive for our Black and global majority talent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>ENDS<\/p>\n<p>IMAGES available :<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gettyimages.fr\/search\/2\/image?family=editorial&amp;phrase=%22the%20garden%20studios%22\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.gettyimages.fr\/search\/2\/image?family=editorial&amp;phrase=%22the%20garden%20studios%22<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Daniel Bee<br \/>DBPR Inc.<br \/>+1 310-854-2834<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/713094424\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d79415.91744671733!2d-0.39825439453123623!3d51.53619237874671!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x487611140047faa9%3A0x7529f207ca938e6c!2sGarden%20Studios!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sfr!4v1716217584305!5m2!1sen!2sfr\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" style=\"border:0;width:100%;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=ZzOEjI5pUTsnJ7kq&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      May 21, 2024, 06:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/713094424\/pma-diverse-squad-times-up-uk-the-british-blacklist-garden-studios-promote-initiative-to-end-discrimination-on-set\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
