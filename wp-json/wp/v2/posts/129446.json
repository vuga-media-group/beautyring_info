The short film depicts the director&#8217;s own battle with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), a condition misunderstood by many in our society to date.<\/p>\n<p>The film revolves around Andrew, a man suffering from uncontrollable, re-occurring thoughts of murdering the love of his life, his girlfriend.

Through this film, Cruz regained control over his life, despite being continuously misdiagnosed and uncertain of his situation. His resilience truly reignited his creative aspirations, burning an undying desire to promote mental health and well-being.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Other Mind&#8221; stars an exceptional cast that is bound to bring this story to life. Multi-talented theater artist with a deep background in athletics, Jamal Lloyd Johnson has played the role of Andrew; his awe-inspiring performance is bound to leave a lasting impact on the audiences. He is joined by the likes of Alexis B. Santiago, renowned for her performances in projects like &#8220;All the World Is Sleeping&#8221; and &#8220;Far Cry 5: Inside Eden&#8217;s Gate,&#8221; and seasoned artists like Sharon Gardner.<\/p>\n<p>Film enthusiasts, critics, and Cruz\u2019s fans are in for a treat as this highly anticipated film is coming soon for a worldwide release in Q4 2023. The immersive film will promise to give goosebumps to viewers, leaving them eager to experience the whole story.<\/p>\n<p>As post-production nears completion, &#8220;The Other Mind&#8221; is gearing up to make its mark on the 2023\u2019s Festival circuit. The film&#8217;s exploration of the human psyche and Cruz&#8217;s personal triumph over OCD is certain to resonate with audiences worldwide.
