The project is arranging screenings of the 2014 Ukrainian film &#8220;The Guide&#8221; on campuses in the U.S. to help students and others understand Ukraine\u2019s decades-long effort to resist Russian invasion. The announcement comes with the 2-year anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion approaching.  <\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a new and important phase of Stand With Ukraine Through Film,\u201d said Marshall Strauss, the Project Organizer and Owner of Cinema Salem in Salem, Massachusetts, where &#8220;The Guide&#8221; had its international premiere in March 2022.  \u201cAbout 700 cinemas in the U.S. and other countries followed our lead and played this important film in 2022 and 2023. All ticket revenue and donations were used to support education and humanitarian relief.  In the U.S. alone, this exceeded $125,000,\u201d Strauss noted.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Guide&#8221; is a two-hour dramatic film by acclaimed Ukrainian Director Oles Sanin. Set against the Soviet Union&#8217;s genocidal policies that led to the death of millions of Ukrainians in the 1930s, it was selected as the Ukrainian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cDespite the film\u2019s historical setting, it feels quite current,\u201d said Lisa Vucelich, the project\u2019s Communications Director.  \u201cWe are delighted that faculty, students and others on campuses throughout the nation see this film as an important educational tool.\u201d  Vucelich also noted that in addition to arranging screenings in cinemas and on campuses, Stand With Ukraine Through Film arranged for &#8220;The Guide&#8221; to play on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. in June 2022.<\/p>\n<p>Below is a partial list of recent and upcoming campus screenings, with more being planned for the summer and fall semesters.  Many of the campus events will have speakers on-site and virtual Q&amp;A sessions with project leaders. <\/p>\n<p>The film will also be shown again at Cinema Salem on February 24, 2024 for the 2-year anniversary of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion.  <\/p>\n<p>\u2022\tArizona State University<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tCarnegie Mellon University<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tCollege of Wooster<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tGeorge Washington University<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tGustavus Adolphus College<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tKent State University<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tMiami University<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tOhio State University<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tUniversity of Florida<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tUniversity of Kansas<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tUniversity of Pittsburgh<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tUniversity of Texas at Austin<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tWellesley College<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tWest Virginia University<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe expect this list to grow fast,\u201d noted Vucelich. \u201cDiscussions are underway with numerous other educational institutions,\u201d she added.  <\/p>\n<p>The project\u2019s website provides background on the numerous film industry companies that have assisted with this effort.
