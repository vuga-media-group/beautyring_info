During the pandemic, due to the high rate of coronavirus transmission and an abundance of significant symptoms, many people purposely delayed their regular medical and dental appointments. Moreover, medical professionals also postponed numerous dental treatments and restricted outpatient visits in order to stop the dangerous virus from spreading.

Furthermore, owing to the growing demand for better healthcare facilities, various manufacturing companies are focusing on expanding their denture product range and offering new and improved denture items, which is estimated to unlock lucrative opportunities for market growth in the forecast period.
