One of these factors is the need for more affordable and high-quality equipment. Another factor is the desire of IVD OEMs to expand their presence in the market and establish themselves as prominent players in related markets. Additionally, CMO facilities offer reduced risk of development failure and lower cross-contamination rates for IVD consumables. Ultimately, small outsourcing facilities in emerging nations are becoming more prevalent. Nevertheless, the market&#8217;s growth is impeded by a lack of skilled labor, as well as the risks of patent infringement and other intellectual property safety failures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get a Sample Copy of the Report:<\/strong> <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=QfqS3Kp-afGG_MgIgephap4DKlFNy6WBkDXXyFg2qhvw8fNPShdwrXb1P28ZPHyGl7OBKNc49ayW49e6lCK7pK-Qi0ZmhOnsRpYhLDbE1SaE5tFA1ctVbXi7ZhK2uUyL9tQX1Nnnk_JWLlSyYt-haPtotDox0-xZFhC65CfLt5FADWzZuocVnZBFgnsWSDBYS9uO9tfLBrfjDo4sVPfCzQ==\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.futuremarketinsights.com\/reports\/sample\/rep-gb-18102<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The contract manufacturing sector plays a significant role in the global in vitro diagnostic (IVD) industry by providing a wide range of reagents, test kits, instruments, systems, and accessories for testing. The market for contract manufacturing in the IVD report highlights the potential for this multi-billion dollar segment to experience substantial long-term growth.<\/p>\n<p>The goals for the IVD contract manufacturing market are to expand current product lines, increase access to IVD testing technologies, introduce tests and testing systems for emerging diseases and disorders like COVID-19 and Monkeypox quickly, gain support for regulatory filings, penetrate high-growth applications, especially in the point-of-care (POC) testing area, and meet the specialized testing needs of significant end users. Additionally, the aim is to broaden access to manufacturing capacity without requiring capital investment. Most leading global manufacturers of proprietary IVD systems are likely to increase their reliance on external contractors as a cost-effective strategy to achieve these goals.<\/p>\n<p>IVD contract manufacturing companies offer research services like assay development or drug discovery, mainly on a contractual basis. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies outsource their work to a CRO to reduce expenses. These companies hire an IVD contract manufacturer to produce the finished product. Such factors are expected to fuel the growth of this segment, which, in turn, drives the market growth during the forecast period.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201c<\/strong><strong><em>The IVD market is growing due to demand for point-of-care testing, molecular diagnostics, and sequencing, which further drives the need for contract manufacturing services,\u201d<\/em><\/strong><strong> opines <\/strong><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=LQUg5ngcWaV0Sp3v_jHDd_-6njcsSip0fsRdwr5K_yz1JY3r9XWiU4_r7Bi1m68z5rmfk1KD8Ys8gR_lHwtnS2E-a_eK4Vvx4-oiRvqMgcm3y_cB-wLvUB9P1hmdiYXW\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><strong>Sabyasachi Ghosh<\/strong><\/a><strong>, Associate Vice President at Future Market Insights (FMI).<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">The global IVD contract manufacturing market is estimated to register a CAGR of 12.1% with a valuation of US$ 46 billion by 2033.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">The market captured a CAGR of 15.1% in the historical period between 2018 and 2022.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">South Korea is anticipated to dominate the global market by registering a 14.1% CAGR during the forecast period.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">With a 13.0% CAGR, Japan is driving the global market by 2033.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">The United Kingdom is anticipated to secure a CAGR of 12.9% in the global market during the forecast period.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">As per the research, China acquires a value share of 12.7% in the global IVD contract manufacturing market in 2033.<\/li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom:8pt;\">The United States IVD contract manufacturing market holds a global market share of 11.9% in 2033.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>IVD Contract Manufacturing Market Report Coverage:<\/strong><\/p>\n<table style=\"border-top: solid black 1pt ;
