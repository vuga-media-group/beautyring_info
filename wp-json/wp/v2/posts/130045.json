Boxboard packaging is highly versatile and can be tailored to suit a wide range of products. The boxboard boxes can be designed to accommodate various shapes and sizes, whether it&#8217;s cosmetics, electronics, apparel, or food items. The boxboard packaging often comes with convenient features such as easy-to-use closures, handles, and windows for product visibility.<\/p>\n<p>Boxboard offers excellent protection to products from external impacts during handling, transportation, and storage. Its sturdy and durable nature ensures that delicate or fragile items remain intact and undamaged throughout the supply chain. The retail industry&#8217;s expansion, particularly in emerging markets, is propelling the demand for boxboard packaging. The need for attractive and functional packaging solutions in retail stores has led to increased adoption of boxboard boxes for product display and presentation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get <\/strong><strong>Drivers and Challenges Impact Market Dynamics.
