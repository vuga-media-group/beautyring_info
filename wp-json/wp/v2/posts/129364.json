Visitors in <span class=\"xn-location\">West Maui<\/span> have largely heeded the call to leave the island. About 46,000 people have flown out of Kahului Airport since Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>In the weeks ahead, the collective resources and attention of the federal, state and county government, the <span class=\"xn-location\">West Maui<\/span> community, and the travel industry must be focused on the recovery of residents who were forced to evacuate their homes and businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Visitors with plans to stay in <span class=\"xn-location\">West Maui<\/span> in the coming weeks and months are urged to consider rescheduling their travel plans for a later time when the overall situation has improved for area residents.<\/p>\n<p>Hotels in <span class=\"xn-location\">West Maui<\/span> have temporarily stopped accepting bookings of future reservations. At this time, many hotels are housing their employees and families until the fires in <span class=\"xn-location\">West Maui<\/span> are fully contained and travel on the roadways is safe. These same hotels are preparing to house evacuees and first responders working on disaster recovery.<\/p>\n<p>While efforts are underway to restore basic services, like power and communications, visitors are encouraged to refrain from attempting to reach <span class=\"xn-location\">West Maui<\/span> accommodations for reservation adjustments until the situation improves.<\/p>\n<p>Travel to the other Hawaiian Islands, like Kaua\u02bbi, O\u02bbahu, L\u0101na\u02bbi, and Hawai\u02bbi Island, are not affected at this time.<\/p>\n<p><b>Access Restrictions In L\u0101hain\u0101\u00a0<br class=\"dnr\"><\/b>The devastation in L\u0101hain\u0101 is immense and unprecedented. The extent of the damage affecting residents, families and area businesses has yet to be fully understood. Experts have warned that hazardous materials are likely present. The area most affected by the wildfires is off limits to the public.<\/p>\n<p>Visitors leaving <span class=\"xn-location\">West Maui<\/span>, or needing to pass by L\u0101hain\u0101 to pick up their belongings, are reminded to comply with the protocols established by law enforcement and <span class=\"xn-location\">Maui County<\/span> officials.
