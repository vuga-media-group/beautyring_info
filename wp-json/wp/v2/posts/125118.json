This development comes as crucial support for the Alberta Cosmetic Pharmacy Association&#8217;s efforts to oppose the prohibition.<\/p>\n<p>In its detailed response, RXA questioned the vague language of the ACP&#8217;s draft Standards of Practice and suggested alternative approaches that would ensure both patient safety and continuity of care.<\/p>\n<p>Key arguments included:<\/p>\n<p>4.3.2: The RXA called for clarification on the intention behind this proposal, expressing concerns about ambiguity. Instead of enforcing a total restriction, RXA suggests the establishment of clear competence criteria, knowledge, and skills required for pharmacists to administer these injections safely and effectively.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe Association posits that many pharmacists have undergone competency learning and training to provide these services confidently. If a pharmacist can demonstrate their skills and knowledge according to ACP criteria, they argue, they should be allowed to continue administering aesthetic injections.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe RXA further criticized the proposal for potentially leading to a transfer of care to less qualified individuals, contrasting this with other healthcare professionals&#8217; freedoms, such as dentists, who are permitted to perform Botox injections for aesthetic reasons.<\/p>\n<p>7.7.3 a) i): In keeping with the person-centered standards, RXA advocated for considering the positive impacts on mental health derived from improving body image via aesthetic injections.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe Association queried the distinction between &#8220;health&#8221; treatments and those labeled &#8220;aesthetic,&#8221; calling the total restriction on aesthetic injections &#8220;unreasonable.&#8221; RXA urged the College to define the competencies needed for pharmacists to provide aesthetic services safely.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThis response from RXA is critical to the ongoing debate around pharmacists&#8217; roles in providing aesthetic services. It emphasizes the necessity of clear regulations, sufficient training, and competence as a way to ensure both patient safety and the broadening of pharmacy practice in Alberta.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Kamal Alhallak, the president of the Alberta Cosmetic Pharmacist Association, expressed his thoughts on the matter: &#8220;I am pleased to see such a strong response from RXA. It&#8217;s heartening to see that our vision, that acknowledges the significant number of pharmacists in Alberta who have adapted and invested in a career in cosmetic injections and aesthetic medicine, is shared.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He continued, &#8220;I recall in June 2019, when I sent <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/albertacosmeticpharmacist.ca\/letter-to-the-acp\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">a letter to ACP<\/a>, urging them to recognize and regulate the pharmacists&#8217; role in cosmetic medicine within the SPPPT. Today, I extend that request further. I implore the ACP registrar to initiate a dialogue with CPSA, CARNA, and Alberta Health. Our aim should be to standardize and regulate the medical spa industry in the best interests of patient safety and service continuity.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Background <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nA brewing controversy in the Alberta healthcare industry has garnered significant attention as the Alberta Cosmetic Pharmacy Association have opposed a proposed ban on pharmacists administering aesthetic injections.<\/p>\n<p>On May 12, the Alberta College of Pharmacy (ACP) circulated an email among its members stating, &#8220;The Council of the Alberta College of Pharmacy (ACP) has approved DRAFT Standards of Practice for Pharmacists and Pharmacy Technicians (SPPPT), for the purpose of conducting a 60-day consultation with regulated members and interested parties.&#8221; However, it has been pointed out that the proposed ban on aesthetic injections by pharmacists was subtly embedded within the 50-page document, which raised concerns about transparency and full disclosure.<\/p>\n<p>In response, the Alberta Cosmetic Pharmacy Association initiated <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.change.org\/Aesthetic-pharmacists\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">a petition opposing the ban<\/a>, which has already collected close to 700 signatures. This signifies the strength of opposition among stakeholders to the proposed change in the Standards of Practice.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Communication Office<br \/>Alberta Cosmetic Pharmacist Assocation<br \/>+1 587-520-2835<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/642380962\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/alberta-cosmetic-pharmacist-association-acpa\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=Ind2m4abJFfFOcon&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      June 30, 2023, 18:00 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/642380962\/alberta-pharmacy-association-challenges-proposed-ban-on-aesthetic-injections-by-pharmacists-in-alberta\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
