The problem is: she doesn\u2019t know how to relinquish her widowhood, a mind \u2013 and heart \u2013 set that has defined her life for so long.<\/p>\n<p>The book mirrors the broad strokes of Malden\u2019s life; she was widowed and remarried several years later. However, it is entirely a work of fiction. Malden spent three years crafting that fiction around the germ of truth from her own life.<\/p>\n<p>Her efforts have paid off. The book, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/My-Two-Only-Carla-Malden-ebook\/dp\/B0C81C3M5M\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">My Two And Only<\/a> (released in August by Rare Bird Books) was recently named one of the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sandiegouniontribune.com\/entertainment\/story\/2023-09-08\/fall-arts-preview-2023-our-picks-for-the-season\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">San Diego Union-Tribune&#8217;s Top Book Picks for the Season<\/a> in their Fall Arts Preview. It also has garnered exceptional testimonials and reviews (see below).<\/p>\n<p>Among them:<\/p>\n<p>Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey,\u00a0author of\u00a0A Woman of Independent Means, writes: &#8220;Love is eternal. Life goes on. How can one heart contain these two verities? That is the question posed by this playful yet profound, perfectly titled novel.\u00a0Carla\u00a0Malden\u00a0writes with charm and ease, lighting the darker moments with knowing wit. &#8216;Put the kettle on&#8217; and enjoy the journey.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Melissa Pritchard,\u00a0author of\u00a0A Solemn Pleasure,\u00a0Palmerino,\u00a0The Odditorium, observes: &#8220;Carla\u00a0Malden\u2019s\u00a0My Two And Only\u00a0is a witty, invigorating, deeply wise novel about loss, grief, resilience and ultimately, renewal. I adore this novel, its irresistible pacing and humor, its quiet home truths and\u00a0Malden\u2019s persuasive belief in the tender, tenacious power of the heart to uplift and to heal.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Joseph Di Prisco, author of\u00a0Subway to California and chairman of the New Literary Project, concurs: &#8220;You owe it to yourself to discover this wonderful new novel and find out how [Malden] makes us strive to understand what we will never understand about love, and about loss. Mostly about love. After reading\u00a0Carla\u00a0Malden, your world will become bigger and brighter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kirkus Reviews states: &#8220;A refreshing story that acknowledges that some people have more than one true love.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After a series of successful Read and Sign events across California this Summer and Fall, Malden is launching into a flurry of podcasts in the coming weeks. These include:<\/p>\n<p>\uf0d8 Drinks with Tony: A Writer Interviewing Writers &#8212; Monday, November 13th at 3pm Pacific. Featuring the always lively and insightful author Tony Dushane going one-on- one with writers.<\/p>\n<p>\uf0d8 Rare Bird Books Crowdcast \u2013- Tuesday, November 14th at 5pm Pacific. Malden joins Maria Quiban, weather anchor for KTTV in Los Angeles, who \u2013 like Malden \u2013 lost her husband to cancer and wrote a book about surviving that experience titled You Can\u2019t Do It Alone: A Widow\u2019s Journey Through Loss, Grief and Life After.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\uf0d8 Salt Lick Dirt Podcast &#8212; Thursday, November 16th at 6pm Pacific<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nJoin host Kyler Bingham in conversation with notable authors and filmmakers.<\/p>\n<p>My Two and Only is a love story about clinging to the past and embracing the present. About  memory and the stories we tell ourselves. About identities, inner and outward, and the struggle to make peace between them. Humorous and insightful, poignant and profound,\u00a0it\u00a0explores  the question: how much happiness can we allow ourselves . . . and which self might that be?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nMalden, who lives in Los Angeles and is the daughter of Oscar-winning actor\u00a0Karl\u00a0Malden, has published two other well-received novels in the last four years \u2013\u00a0Search Heartache\u00a0(2019) and\u00a0Shine Until Tomorrow\u00a0(2021). Like My Two And Only, these also explore versions of a theme: women overcoming personal loss and pain and carving a new path forward.<\/p>\n<p>Carla\u00a0knows firsthand what she writes; she lost her first husband to cancer in 2007 and confronted her grief\u00a0head-on by writing AfterImage: A Broken-Hearted Memoir of a Charmed Life &#8212; a fiercely moving memoir about the last year of her husband\u2019s life and her first year without him. She also co-authored her father\u2019s critically acclaimed autobiography, When Do I Start?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nHer novels resonate with blunt honesty, deep insight, and unexpected humor tackling issues that many women are facing today.\u00a0<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nFor more information about Carla Malden and her books, visit her website: carlamalden.com<\/p>\n<p>To request a PDF or hardcover of My Two And Only for review \u2013 or to arrange an interview with the author \u2013 please contact Scott Busby at The Busby Group: scottb@thebusbygroup.com or 310.600.7645.<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n# # #<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Scott T Busby<br \/>The Busby Group<br \/>+1 310-600-7645<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/666766682\/mailto:scottb@thebusbygroup.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">scottb@thebusbygroup.com<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Carla Malden&#8217;s New Novel MY TWO AND ONLY Poses the Question: Can You Have Only One True Love in Your Life?<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"TWeD6ZQNw8E\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"IMG 8034\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TWeD6ZQNw8E?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=sM2gR5HongpMDA_3&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      November 08, 2023, 13:27 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/666766682\/carla-malden-s-my-two-and-only-named-top-book-pick-in-san-diego-union-tribune-s-fall-arts-preview\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
