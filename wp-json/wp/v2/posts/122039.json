The Canadian family who runs a \u201cpositive vlog channel\u201d includes Tray Rush and Keshia Rush with their children Kameiro, Cali, and Kirah. Currently, the Rush Fam has four channels, namely The Rush Fam where they share raw moments of their lives, FamousTubeFamily where they do family skits and challenges, Rush Fam Gaming where they share their love for computer games, and Cali&#8217;s Playhouse for all of Cali\u2019s fun adventures. Collectively, they have amassed over 10 million subscribers and more than six billion views on YouTube alone. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are excited to be working with Gushcloud. The company has a track record of creating strong financial and business opportunities for macro creators like us where we are looking for a partner to grow our presence in the global markets, and also to co-invest alongside us via the Creator Venture Program to build a portfolio of brands with us. Gushcloud has a presence in key markets and that is important for our growth. We are grateful for our enormous success driven by YouTube over the last few years but we have the ambition to do a lot more and we believe that the Gushcloud team will help us get there,\u201d said Tray and Keshia Rush.<\/p>\n<p>The creator economy has exploded over the past few years and continues to do so. A recent report from Goldman Sachs Research predicts that the market will double in size from the current $250 billion to $480 billion by 2027. This is due to a number of reasons such as increased digital media consumption, and the emergence of new platforms such as TikTok while other platforms such as Facebook and YouTube have created new formats for sharing short-form video, live streaming, as well as other types of user-generated content. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt Gushcloud, we value the family category. Via the Creator Venture Program that we have developed, it gives us the opportunity to source for top creators in key categories that we care about, and invest a significant amount of money into them so that we can work alongside them to build up their content and commerce portfolio. Both Tray and Keisha are examples of top creators that we can invest in to bring what they have created to the next level and be able to build an empire upon the brand name and content The Rush Fam has created in the last decade,\u201d said Andrew Lim, Group CFO, Gushcloud International. <\/p>\n<p>Via the Creator Venture Program, The Rush Fam will be working alongside Gushcloud to expand their business portfolio. Keshia Rush will be doubling down her efforts to launch a personal care and home goods brand called Fortune &amp; Flame, such as scented candles and bath bombs, at fortuneandflame.com. Meanwhile, Tray Rush will be launching an app in the last quarter of this year to assist audiences with self help and meditation. He will also be working on his first book to be released in early 2024, and will be building up a portfolio of brands that include a performance drink. <\/p>\n<p>In addition to these endeavours, the studios team at Gushcloud will also assist The Rush Fam in expanding and optimising the current YouTube channels. Recently, the team developed the \u201cRush Life Podcast\u201d where Tray and Keshia deep dive into topics relating to their personal, family, and married life. The team has also kickstarted a gaming channel led by Kameiro, the eldest son of the family. <\/p>\n<p>For more about The Rush Fam, subscribe to all their YouTube channels, and follow Tray Rush on Instagram and Twitter, and Keshia Rush on Instagram and Twitter.
