Meadows&#8217; most recent triumph comes with his screenplay, &#8220;<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/XQzYrGyQZCQ\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Flash Card<\/a>,&#8221; which garnered the Best Drama\/Thriller laurels at the prestigious Vegas Movie Awards.<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Meadows&#8217; background has been characterized by innovation, resilience, and a commitment to humanitarian causes. Before the pandemic, Stephen was primarily focused on leveraging his patented <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.parabounce.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Parabounce<\/a> invention for philanthropic events that promised the public an opportunity to experience the joy of flying human-powered dirigibles within massive dome structures for the benefit of challenged children.\u00a0Sadly, the pandemic led to the abrupt suspension of these endeavors. However, the adversity served as a catalyst for Stephen to resurrect screenplays he had crafted decades prior.\u00a0This pivot has borne remarkable fruit. Four of Meadows&#8217; scripts have amassed over eighty international awards and honors, rising to the top ranks in dozens of competitions, establishing Stephen as a prominent voice in the screenwriting arena.<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Among Meadows&#8217; noteworthy projects is the captivating family drama, &#8220;It&#8217;s Only Life,&#8221; poised to be directed by Alec Griffin Roth, writer\/director of &#8220;<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FOF1HSX1xQg\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Billy Knight<\/a>,&#8221; starring Charlie Heaton, Diana Silvers and Al Pacino, now in post production. The connection between Meadows and Roth was instant, with Stephen expressing his confidence in Roth&#8217;s directorial prowess. In his own words, &#8220;The day Kyle Gold [\u201cIt\u2019s Only Life\u201d producer] introduced me to Alec, we immediately connected, and I knew he was the right guy to direct this film. Alec is undeniably gifted and his career is beginning to soar. The trailer for the film is beautiful.&#8221;<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Drawing upon his experience in the 90\u2019s as an actor in film and television, Meadows assembled a team of seasoned professionals, including Nancy Green-Keyes, renowned casting director of &#8220;The Notebook&#8221; and producer Keyun &#8216;Country&#8217; Parker, (\u201cBilly Knight,\u201d \u201cBloodline Killers,\u201d \u201cLive\u201d).\u00a0<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Meadows&#8217; history is woven with diverse threads. From his formative years in Georgia playing football for the Georgia Bulldogs and serving in the Marine Corps, to establishing himself as an architect in San Francisco, with teaching appointments at San Francisco State University, the Academy of Art and the Rudolph Schaeffer School of Design.<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Stephen\u2019s contributions extend beyond the creative realm. He spent a year volunteering at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center&#8217;s ER in Los Angeles, lending his support where it matters most. His humanitarian endeavors span the globe, from volunteering as a medical worker and firefighter in Peru to providing disaster relief in Sri Lanka after the Tsunami.<br \/>\u00a0<br \/>Meadows&#8217; company, One Giant Leap, directs all profits to causes benefiting children. Recognized in 2007\u2019s &#8220;Who&#8217;s Who&#8221;, Meadows resides in Venice Beach, California and is the proud father of three \u201camazing human beings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Kyle Gold<br \/>One Giant Leap<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/650730136\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.stephenmeadows.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Other<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/stephen-meadows-76b2688\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCfQDKZXj1cTiLnWLMEpcS3A\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">YouTube<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/parabounce\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Instagram<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video_title\">Flash Card Storyboard Movie<\/p>\n<p class=\"pr_video\" style=\"margin: 20px 0 10px 0;\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"XQzYrGyQZCQ\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"FlashCardDeckMovie 07 23 23\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XQzYrGyQZCQ?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=xTNmYFShHzq5_Har&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      August 19, 2023, 09:45 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/650730136\/stephen-meadows-wins-best-thriller-script-in-vegas\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
