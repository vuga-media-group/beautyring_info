numerous exotic locations, an increase in demand for personalized vacations, availability of easy transportation facilities, a fast-growing number of food and drink festivals, and the presence of major players. In <span class=\"xn-location\">Europe<\/span>, the buying capacity of Baby Boomers is on the rise. This generation prefers to travel together with their families on multigenerational or tailormade vacations, including good meals and family activities. Furthermore, the growing number of gastronomical festivals and the expanding range of adventure sports, e.g., kitesurfing, mountain biking, or paragliding is attracting a high volume of domestic and international tourists to countries like the <span class=\"xn-location\">United Kingdom<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Germany<\/span>, <span class=\"xn-location\">Spain<\/span>, and Switzerland.\u00a0Hence, these factors are expected to drive market growth in the region during the forecast period.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"prntac\"><b><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.technavio.com\/talk-to-us?report=IRTNTR44241&amp;type=sample&amp;rfs=epd&amp;src=report&amp;utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=T2023_VO_wk40_2023_019_rfs2&amp;utm_content=IRTNTR44241\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Download Free\u00a0sample report<\/a>\u00a0to get more insights on the market share of various regions and the contribution of the segments.<\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li><b>Impactful driver-\u00a0<\/b>Increasing disposable incomes<\/li>\n<li><b>Key Trend <\/b>&#8211; Trending sports tourism<\/li>\n<li><b>Major Challenges\u00a0<\/b>&#8211; Threat of natural calamities and other issues<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u00a0<b>Market Segmentation<\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>By Consumer, the market is classified into Domestic and International.\u00a0The market share growth by the domestic segment will be significant during the forecast period.\u00a0Supportive government regulations, lack of currency exchange issues, and familiarity with culture and language contribute to the growth of domestic luxury travel. Domestic tourism is a lucrative business, and due to the rising trend for micro trips and staycations, it will continue to grow. In comparison with international travel, luxury vacations at home are a cost-efficient option. In addition, domestic tourism and luxury travel are mainly aimed at encouraging tourists to visit natural cultural sites, with a view to informing them of their country&#8217;s history and culture. In <span class=\"xn-location\">Morocco<\/span>, for example, domestic luxury travel packages take tourists to various tourist destinations throughout the country, such as the Atlas Mountains to the beach of Essaouira, the Sahara Desert to the palm groves of Todra Valley, and the medieval city of Fes to the spice markets of Marrakech.\u00a0Hence, these factors are expected to drive segment growth during the forecast period.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"prntac\"><b>Technavio Research experts have provided more insights on the market share of segments &#8211; <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.technavio.com\/talk-to-us?report=IRTNTR44241&amp;type=sample&amp;rfs=epd&amp;src=report&amp;utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=T2023_VO_wk40_2023_019_rfs3&amp;utm_content=IRTNTR44241\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">View Sample Report<\/a><\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Related Reports<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.technavio.com\/report\/travel-market-industry-analysis?utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=T2023_VO_wk40_2023_019_rr1&amp;utm_content=IRTNTR44241\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><b>travel market<\/b><\/a>\u00a0size is estimated to\u00a0grow\u00a0at a\u00a0CAGR of 14.18%\u00a0between 2022\u00a0and 2027.
