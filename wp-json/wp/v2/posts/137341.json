With more people becoming aware of the risks of skin cancer, there is a growing demand for protective measures. Cosmetic companies have been investing in innovative <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.knowledge-sourcing.com\/report\/skincare-serums-market\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">skincare serums<\/a>, creating formulations that not only protect the skin from UV rays but also offer additional skincare benefits. This has led to an increase in market growth of sunscreens worldwide. According to the World Health Organization in 2019, while working outdoors 1.6 billion people of working age were exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation. Almost 19,000 people died from non-melanoma skin cancer as a result of working outside in the sun in 183 countries. <\/p>\n<p>Sunscreens prevent skin cancer and skin-related disorders caused by UV radiation and other external factors. The market is witnessing substantial growth due to growing self-consciousness, and efforts to reduce skin cancer prevalence which has positively impacted the demand for various <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.knowledge-sourcing.com\/report\/global-facial-care-market\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">facial care<\/a> products inclusive of sunscreens. <\/p>\n<p>Numerous product launches and advancements are taking place in the market. For instance, in September 2023, BASF launched a new sunscreen ingredient TinomaxTM CC. Tinomax TM CC is intended for use in skin and sun care formulations, and it provides a significant sensory improvement, owing in part to its homogeneous particle shape. It comes in the form of an off-white powder and can boost UV protection with SPF and UVA through light birefringence. Furthermore, tests have shown that Tinomax CC-containing formulations are significantly less sticky and greasy during application than formulations without this ingredient.<\/p>\n<p>Access sample report or view details: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.knowledge-sourcing.com\/report\/global-sunscreen-market\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/www.knowledge-sourcing.com\/report\/global-sunscreen-market<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The global sunscreen market, based on its type is segmented into, two main categories namely mineral and chemical.<\/p>\n<p>The global sunscreen market, based on texture is segmented into, five main categories namely creams and lotions, gels, sticks, sprays, and powders.<\/p>\n<p>The global sunscreen market, based on application is segmented into, two main categories namely face and beauty.<\/p>\n<p>North America is poised to experience substantial growth.
