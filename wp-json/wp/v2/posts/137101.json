As the president of the international division of the Kensington Royal Hotel Corporation, it\u2019s his job to stop trouble before it reaches red, the deadliest level in his five-tier Red Hotel threat assessment plan. <\/p>\n<p>Get a sense of the books:<\/p>\n<p>RED HOTEL \u2013 BOOK 1<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nTerrorists bomb a hotel in Tokyo, but the reverberations are felt around the world. A high-ranking Kremlin diplomat is assassinated. A building in Kiev blows up. Russia begins to amass forces along its western borders. Former Army intelligence officer Dan Reilly, now an international hotel executive with high-level access to the CIA, believes the plot is much bigger than anyone imagines, involving the empire-building, Putin-esque president of Russia.<\/p>\n<p>RED DECEPTION \u2013 BOOK 2<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nAmerica\u2019s infrastructure is under attack!<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nWhen terrorists bomb bridges that cross the Potomac, the Mississippi, Pittsburgh\u2019s three rivers, and the Lincoln Tunnel under the Hudson, America realizes how vulnerable we are. Hoover Dam could be next, threatening energy and water services throughout the Southwest. Dan Reilly, a freelance State Department and CIA consultant, working full-time as International President Kensington Royal Hotels, is drawn into a web of intrigue 12-years in the making involving the current American president, a United States senator, a cunning Chinese businessman, and the death of a young girl.<\/p>\n<p>RED CHAOS \u2013 BOOK 3<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nThe Arctic ice is melting, the waters are warming, and Russia\u2019s ever-expanding fleet of oil tankers grind through the Northern Sea Route to China. With a fleet of nuclear ice breakers clearing the way, Russian ships were setting new records to reach China and fulfilling a simple equation: Russian President Nicolai Gorshkov needs China\u2019s money to fund his expansionism plans past Ukraine and Latvia while China, the thirstiest oil nation in the world, needs affordable fuel.<\/p>\n<p>How these seemingly different elements have a profound impact on Russia\u2019s far-reaching plans is what makes Red Chaos a thriller to be read like breaking news.<\/p>\n<p>RED CHAOS, along RED HOTEL, and RED DECEPTION are published by Beaufort Books and available in print, ebook, and Audible additions at Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble or a bookstore near you.
