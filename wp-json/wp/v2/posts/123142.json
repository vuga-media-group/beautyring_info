However, supply continues to outpace demand and is up 21% year-over-year (YoY), resulting in lower total revenue per property YoY.<\/li>\n<li>On the bright side, there have been economic shifts that may benefit owners in the summer months; <u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3886244-1&amp;h=2015751360&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usinflationcalculator.com%2Finflation%2Fcurrent-inflation-rates%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DThe%2520annual%2520inflation%2520rate%2520for%2CDepartment%2520data%2520published%2520Feb.%252014.&amp;a=inflation+dropped\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">inflation dropped<\/a><\/u> from 6% in February to 4.9% this April, and <u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3886244-1&amp;h=3881449956&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.hopper.com%2Fresearch%2F2023-summer-travel-outlook&amp;a=domestic+flight+prices\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">domestic flight prices<\/a><\/u> are down 19% from last year.<\/li>\n<li>Additionally, the supply growth rate of new homes entering the market is beginning to stabilize at 22% per month. That, juxtaposed against an increasing demand growth rate of 2-3% per month since January, could be an early sign that the gap between the two may start to shrink.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Nimble rates are key to outperforming the competition. <\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Competitive rates adapted to today&#8217;s market are one of the best ways for owners to lock in harder-to-win bookings. Depending on a region&#8217;s activity, this could mean rates should be set differently from last month, last year, or even years past.<\/li>\n<li>Owners should also use booking trends to inform when to lower rates to capture interest from last-minute bookers and avoid having an empty property. While winter showed many guests were planning ahead, the spring break holiday saw more travelers booking on short notice \u2013 within 14 days of arrival \u2013 when they had the flexibility to wait for deals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Reviews and amenities turn lookers into bookers.<\/b><\/p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>Owners don&#8217;t need to rely solely on lowering rates if their region is getting more competitive \u2013 flexible cancellation policies, great guest reviews, and strategically designed listing content can also show guests a home is a great option.<\/li>\n<li>As we head into the summer months, owners can also <u><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3886244-1&amp;h=934209239&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fevolve.com%2Fblog%2Fhomeowner-tips%2Fbest-vacation-rental-amenities%2F%3Futm_source%3Dearned%26utm_medium%3Dpr&amp;a=prioritize+the+amenities\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">prioritize the amenities<\/a><\/u> that guests are looking for when booking a stay in their specific region during this time of year.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><i>By leveraging some of the strategies above, Evolve homes earned nearly 5% more base revenue per property than the market.
