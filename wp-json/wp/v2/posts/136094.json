All indications point to that trend continuing at Hake\u2019s November 14-15 auction, which is packed with the elusive memorabilia today\u2019s collectors desire but rarely see in the marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>Perennially a strong category for Hake\u2019s, political memorabilia will open the 1,909-lot sale, starting with an item of great historical importance. Lot #1 is a March 31, 1968 church program book from Washington Cathedral, signed by the <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/mvyzf2nm\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr<\/a>, who delivered his last Sunday sermon at that service. Four days later, Dr King lost his life to an assassin\u2019s bullet. The autograph was obtained by a then-18-year-old college student who went on to become a Washington lawyer. He treasured the memento for 55 years before making the decision to part with it. According to Hake\u2019s research, no other MLK-autographed item ever to come to auction was signed at a later point in Dr King\u2019s life. A framed presentation, the signed book comes with a JSA LOA and a letter from the consignor detailing the circumstances leading up to his fortuitous encounter with the civil rights icon. Estimate: $35,000-$50,000<\/p>\n<p>An 1856 hand-painted folk art parade banner designed in Spencerian style promotes the ultimately unsuccessful Republican presidential\/VP candidates John C Fremont and William L Dayton. Hand-inked by artist FW Wells onto two vertical sections of unglazed cotton joined at the center, it is attached to a horizontal wooden pole with 31 handmade square nails. A sizable textile measuring 57 by 77inches, this pre-Civil gem is estimated at $20,000-$35,000. <\/p>\n<p>More than 400 CGC and CBCS-certified comic books will be offered, from Golden Age to Modern-era issues. Around 75 are from the Duke Caldwell signed comic book collection, described by Hake\u2019s president, Alex Winter as \u201cunprecedented \u2013 no one has ever had a collection like this one. Each issue has been autographed by someone significant to the book\u2019s production.\u201d The top prize is a <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/hakes.com\/Auction\/ItemDetail\/279795\/AMAZING-SPIDER-MAN-667-OCTOBER-2011-CBCS-VERIFIED-SIGNATURE-98-NMMINT-DELLOTTO-1100-RETAILER-INCENTIVE-VARIANT\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Marvel Amazing Spider-Man<\/a> #667 (Oct. 2011) comic book with cover art by Gabriele Dell\u2019Otto. Issued as a 1:100 retailer incentive variant, it is one of only an estimated 200 in circulation, but it enters another realm of rarity due to the fact that its front cover is boldly signed by both the story\u2019s author Dan Slott and interior artist Humberto Ramos. The CBCS-verified and graded 9.8 NM\/Mint book is expected to make $20,000-$35,000. <\/p>\n<p>A 1984 original first printing of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/hakes.com\/Auction\/ItemDetail\/279186\/TEENAGE-MUTANT-NINJA-TURTLES-1-1984-CGC-92-NM-SIGNATURE-SERIES-WITH-SKETCH-BY-KEVIN-EASTMAN-FIRST-TMNT-FIRST-PRINTING\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles<\/a> #1, which introduced the reptilian crimefighters in comic-book form, has a CGC 9.2 NM signature and Turtle head sketch by co-creator Kevin Eastman on its cover. This key Copper Age comic had an estimated print run of only 3,000 issues. Estimate: $20,000-$35,000<\/p>\n<p>More than 150 lots of original comic art include daily and Sunday strips, comic book covers and pages; VHS cover art, Disney animation and more. A John Byrne original pen-and-ink cover art for Action Comics #588 (DC Comics, May 1987) portrays Superman in space alongside Hawkman and Hawkwoman. Signed and inscribed by Byrne, the 11.25- by 17-inch classic-cover artwork is in excellent condition and estimated at $20,000-$35,000.<\/p>\n<p>After 56 years, Hake\u2019s specialists still can\u2019t say they\u2019ve \u201cseen it all.\u201d That\u2019s because in just about every one of their sales, something extraordinary turns up that has never been seen before in a Hake\u2019s auction. Several notable examples rise to the top layer of the November 14-15 auction, the first being a 1936 Wolverine \u201cStrange True Stories\u201d gum card set. It\u2019s complete with 24 colorful cards including \u201cThe Bat Man,\u201d who is shown flying with bat-like wings. \u201cThere\u2019s no way of knowing if the gum card had an influence on DC Comics\u2019 Batman, but it definitely pre-dates the superhero by a full three years,\u201d said Winter. PSA-graded and with provenance from the John Grossman collection, the set is estimated at $10,000-$20,000. <\/p>\n<p>Other noteworthy gum card sets include a 1940 Gum, Inc. R145 Superman set of 72 cards, $10,000-$20,000; and a fully PSA-graded 1970 Topps test set of 55 cards based on the popular country music and variety show Hee Haw, estimated at $5,000-$10,000.<\/p>\n<p>Another Hake\u2019s first appearance comes in the form of a 1964 music speaker that recalls Glenn Strange\u2019s portrayal of Frankenstein\u2019s Monster in 1940s horror films. Designed as a functional piece, the creepy disembodied head could be plugged into any music source, including a transistor or car radio. Amazingly, the complete and all-original monster curiosity retains its original pictorial box. It could easily scare up a winning bid of $10,000-$20,000.<\/p>\n<p>An extremely rare 1948 Captain Marvel play cape of silkscreened linen faithfully reproduces the design that Fawcett\u2019s \u201cWorld\u2019s Mightiest Mortal\u201d wore in comics. It is an actual finished piece, but the design never saw mass production. In fact, it is the only known example and is being offered for the first time on day two of Hake\u2019s sale. In Fine\/VF condition and with provenance from the collection of Harry Matetsky \u2013 one of the greatest collectors and historians the pop culture hobby has ever known \u2013 it is guided by a $5,000-$10,000 estimate.<\/p>\n<p>Amongst baseball memorabilia collectors, few names garner as much respect as that of the immortal Hall of Famer Jackie Robinson. There will never be a lack of interest in Robinson memorabilia, especially for rarities like the 1953 Our Sports magazine subscription-incentive baseball card that has his picture on the obverse side. In that photo, which is the same one used for the colorized 1953 Topps card that became #1 of a classic set, Robinson is shown in his Brooklyn Dodgers uniform with his facsimile signature across the chest. The only known example, the card is accompanied by a rare issue of Our Sports #2, the CGC-graded 2.5 Good+ card is estimated at $5,000-$10,000.<\/p>\n<p>One of only a handful of its type known to exist, an \u201cIron Man\u201d action figure is from Mego\u2019s \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Super Heroes\u201d line. With a 1975 Marvel Comic Group copyright and contained in a blister card, it is AFA-graded 75 Ex+\/NM and is the only graded example in the AFA Population Report. It will make its Hake\u2019s debut with a $10,000-$20,000 estimate. <\/p>\n<p>More than 250 Star Wars items will cross the auction block, most of them third-party graded. They include an impressive, nearly 3ft long 1978 display header that advertises the first 12 \u201cStar Wars Action Figures,\u201d $20,000-$35,000; a quirky 1988 Uzay (Turkish) Darth Vader action figure on blister card, $10,000-$20,000; and a 1982 metallized gold-finish Darth Vader action figure collector\u2019s case. A first-shot prototype that Kenner produced for their 1983 \u201cStar Wars: Return Of The Jedi\u201d toyline, the figural case is AFA-encapsulated and graded 75 Ex+\/NM. With provenance from the Tad Moore collection, it is expected to reach $10,000-$20,000.<\/p>\n<p>From an outstanding 50-lot selection of Transformer toys \u2013 a category that has \u201ccaught fire\u201d over the past couple of years \u2013 comes a highly desirable 1985 Hasbro Series 2 Jetfire display box containing an Autobot Air Guardian Jetfire with the desirable \u201cTrademark\u201d logo. In an archival case, it is AFA-graded 90 NM+\/Mint and estimated at $10,000-$20,000.<\/p>\n<p>Hake\u2019s Nov. 14-15, 2023 online auction is now open for bidding.
