As The Boy Scouts&#8217; former Youth Protection Director turned whistleblower, Johnson provides crucial insight into the inner workings of The Boy Scouts and speaks to the internal decisions the organization made leading to decades of failed leadership.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOne of the things that they had in their marketing messages is, &#8216;The Boys Scouts has a rigorous application and screening process,&#8217; and that&#8217;s not true, and it&#8217;s never been true,&#8221; says Johnson in the film&#8217;s trailer. &#8220;I&#8217;m here to tell you that the organization is still not safe for boys and girls.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In response to child sexual abuse, Zero Abuse Project offers myriad programs, trainings, and trauma-informed resources, including SurvivorSpace, a technology-based website designed by survivors, for survivors. Funded by the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Office for Victims of Crime, SurvivorSpace offers a safe space for survivors to learn about child sexual abuse, find information on civil litigation and state statutes of limitations, focus on self-care and resiliency, read survivor stories, access national resources and institutional programs, and participate in clinically-supervised chat-based discussion groups.<\/p>\n<p>Zero Abuse Project CEO Jeffrey Dion, himself a survivor of Boy Scout sexual abuse, spoke of the importance of SurvivorSpace. &#8220;As abuse cases are discussed in the media, it can prompt trauma reactions from survivors who have had similar experiences. We anticipate a surge in interest from survivors seeking out information and resources. SurvivorSpace is prepared to meet that need.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Watch the new documentary on Netflix starting September 6th, and visit <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.SurvivorSpace.org\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">www.SurvivorSpace.org<\/a> anytime to view videos, read Tip Sheets, and find resources.
