Dr. Kendall-Tackett&#8217;s book delves deep into the connection between breastfeeding and mental health, offering evidence-based advice and practical solutions for overcoming obstacles that new mothers often face.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike traditional breastfeeding books, &#8220;<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Breastfeeding-Doesnt-Need-Suck-Nurture\/dp\/1433833840\/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Breastfeeding Doesn&#8217;t Need to Suck<\/a>&#8221; goes beyond the basics. It explores crucial topics such as breastfeeding&#8217;s impact on sleep, safe bed-sharing practices, and the influence of a baby&#8217;s sleeping environment on the mother&#8217;s mental health. By addressing these often-overlooked aspects, the book provides a holistic approach to breastfeeding and mental well-being.<\/p>\n<p>Drawing from her extensive experience in both lactation and mental health, Dr. Kendall-Tackett sheds light on the five &#8220;I&#8221;s of new motherhood: idleness, isolation, incompetence, identity, and intensity. She emphasizes that postpartum challenges are not magically resolved by switching to formula milk and provides practical guidance to help mothers navigate these common hurdles, ultimately safeguarding their breastfeeding journey and mental health.<\/p>\n<p>The book is a perfect pick for new mothers seeking guidance on breastfeeding while prioritizing their mental health. It also appeals to partners, grandmothers, and friends who want to offer effective support. This book caters to individuals looking for evidence-based advice and practical solutions for a positive breastfeeding experience.<\/p>\n<p>About the Author<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Kendall-Tackett is a health psychologist and internationally Board Certified Lactation Consultant and the Owner and Editor-in-Chief of Praeclarus Press, a small press specializing in women&#8217;s health.
