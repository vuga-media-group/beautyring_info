Customer\u2019s had\u202fbecome\u202fmore selective when they\u202f made purchases, looking for goods with higher levels of dependability and durability. This had increased the importance of warranty management systems in assuring customers of the quality and longevity of their products. <\/li>\n<li>Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic had created new opportunities for ITAD providers, there had been an increase in dependency on digital channels for warranty registration, claim submission, and communication as physical stores and service centers had been shut down or reduced. As a result, warranty management systems had to accommodate this shift by providing robust online portals and self-service options. <\/li>\n<li>Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic had moderate economic impact on the warranty management system market. In response to the economic challenges posed by the pandemic, businesses focused on cost optimization across various areas, including warranty management. The expenses associated with warranty claims, repairs, and customer support can be decreased by identifying inefficiencies, streamlining processes, and using warranty management tools. \u00a0\u00a0<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Procure Complete Report (404 Pages PDF with Insights, Charts, Tables, and Figures)<\/strong><strong> at:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=JsrXSeVuiPZWWHGPMp5Lsn47qYlt__MgXwgL9Oyj2wBChpeMvR7RCGkr3IMx1ZLfb94CBiy4e_-04AGY8qw1dWG8XvTJZSbK-usm8UBiUcoS8QsNdBwj8Facp6YRzwSiXcNXxpfOs--ZHrHm-rqZi5W2-9OvMXwXtYzyaWqNSNqB2HjLKolAj39el7KJBZ-ltIZBjPjxglnEIENi33psh7Q9yKmXY_YPAth-CVWvf6lOauh_DVUp901CbKsORRfdwbjQaq2nBIHU_yHvaWi0zQ==\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><strong><u>https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/warranty-management-system-market\/purchase-options<\/u><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>The software segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period<\/b><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Based on component, the software segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for more than two-third of the global warranty management software market revenue, and is estimated to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period, as cloud-based solutions are becoming increasingly popular as they offer scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, other key trends in the software segment include the integration of warranty management systems with other enterprise software solutions to provide a seamless customer experience, with the use of blockchain technology and AI to improve data security and transparency. However, the service segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 18.3% from 2023 to 2032, this is because the service segment presents opportunities for companies to offer personalized services to their customers. With the use of customer data, companies tailor their services to meet the specific needs and preferences of their customers, thereby improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. <\/p>\n<p><b>The on-premise segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Based on deployment mode, the on-premise segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for more than three-fifths of the global warranty management software market revenue, as on-premise deployment provides a higher level of data security since sensitive information is stored locally, reducing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access. Furthermore, on-premise deployment can offer better performance and faster access to data since the system is hosted within the organization&#8217;s network infrastructure. However, the cloud segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 18.6% from 2022 to 2032, this is because cloud-based solutions offer real-time updates, ensuring that all parties have access to the most up-to-date information. In addition, cloud-based solutions are more secure than traditional on-premise solutions, as they offer advanced security measures and are protected by the latest technology. <\/p>\n<p><b>The manufacturing segment to maintain its leadership status throughout the forecast period\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Based on industry vertical, the manufacturing segment held the highest market share in 2022, accounting for nearly one-third of the global warranty management software market revenue, this is due to increase in penetration of IoT-enabled devices and connected products is leading to greater automation and data collection capabilities, allowing manufacturers to better monitor product performance and identify potential issues in real time. However, the food and beverages segment is projected to manifest the highest CAGR of 20.1% from 2022 to 2032. This is because the adoption of IoT sensors and predictive analytics is increasing in the food &amp; beverages sector. These technologies can be used to monitor product performance and predict warranty issues before they occur, allowing companies to proactively address issues and reduce downtime and warranty-related costs. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><b>North America to maintain its dominance by 2032<\/b><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Based on region, North America held the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2022, accounting for nearly two-fifths of the global warranty management software market revenue, due to the integration of warranty management systems with other business systems, such as customer relationship management (CRM), supply chain management (SCM), and enterprise resource planning (ERP), is a growing trend in North America. However, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to witness the fastest CAGR of 19.4% from 2023 to 2032, and is likely to dominate the market during the forecast period, as many organizations are deploying these systems to optimize warranty costs, streamline warranty operations, and improve customer satisfaction in sectors such as automotive, electronics, manufacturing, healthcare, and consumer goods.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Enquiry Before Buying:<\/strong> <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=JsrXSeVuiPZWWHGPMp5Lsn47qYlt__MgXwgL9Oyj2wBvDOghOOOCypTMXTXUvbMrvuQySOcDzjCg0NzFI-XRpM_qMtGLQX7_Wm4zZ84dkIOxDdCWA7mAVcb7DRcxoSGMM4LJ4l4etlgLf74hdFZUsOg10In0i8kypLEHoTNmt6DAHCDtqq2NlY0sEeQnDZbT\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><strong><u>https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/purchase-enquiry\/76311<\/u><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Leading Market Players: &#8211;<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>IBM Corporation,\u00a0 <\/li>\n<li>IFS <\/li>\n<li>Mize <\/li>\n<li>Oracle Corporation <\/li>\n<li>Pegasystems Inc. <\/li>\n<li>PTC <\/li>\n<li>Salesforce <\/li>\n<li>SAP <\/li>\n<li>Tavant <\/li>\n<li>Wipro Limited<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">The report provides a detailed analysis of these key players of the global Warranty management software market.
