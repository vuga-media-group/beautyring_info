Dedicated to the children of the Filipino diaspora, this collection of eleven lyrical retellings, lavishly illustrated by Tin Javier, seeks to widen the storytelling space and connect readers to Indigenous Philippine cultural heritage eroded by the enduring impacts of colonialism.<\/p>\n<p>The 100-page children\u2019s book (ages 6-12) is arranged into two sections: seven Indigenous stories and three folk tales. With consent from two community elders of the Tagbanua\u2014one of the oldest Indigenous tribes in the Philippines\u2014audio recordings of their oral storytelling of The Quail and the Shrimp and The Story of Buwal were translated into written English. The rest are adaptations of stories from diverse regions of the Philippines, transporting readers to a wondrous world alight with gods and goddesses, brave heroes, curious creatures, and magical powers. From the adventures of Aponibolinayen as she is carried by vines into the realm of the sun to Tulalang&#8217;s epic battle with a giant eagle, each story is an invitation to dive into the rich storytelling traditions of the Philippines. <\/p>\n<p>An AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/sachsarts.org\/grant-awards\/childrens-book-of-indigenous-philippine-tales\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Grant Awardee of the Sachs Program for Arts Innovation<\/a> at the University of Pennsylvania, the two-year project was sparked by a conversation between two mothers and writers, Tiongson-Perez and Orosa, as they observed their own young children actively seeking connections to their heritage while being raised in Philadelphia and the Cayman Islands. Outside of recounting personal histories, they realized that there was an opportunity to provide more access to Indigenous Filipino literature for children. To illustrate the book, they commissioned Philippine-based collage and mixed media artist Tin Javier, who brought the stories to life using a pattern-rich punched paper technique inspired by Filipino culture.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGrowing up in Manila through the 1980s, I was raised on books filled with Western, Eurocentric narratives and representation,\u201d says Tiongson-Perez. \u201cWhen my daughter began asking for Filipino stories, I realized I only knew a handful compared to the dozens of Hans Christian Anderson and Brothers Grimm fairy tales I love. While researching stories from the Philippines, I was struck by historical and anthropological characterizations of our Indigenous culture as inferior, primitive, even savage. I wondered if a book like this could not only help widen the space to include Indigenous voices but also recover pride in our cultural heritage.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>To inspire curiosity and a deeper exploration of Philippine culture, the book also includes a visual glossary with definitions of regional and colloquial vocabulary, offering short, digestible facts about their meaning or significance.   <\/p>\n<p>Orosa notes, \u201cThe Indigenous stories of the Philippines are as rich and wondrous as any Western counterpart, and yet as an avid reader and teacher who can recount obscure Greek myths on demand, I couldn\u2019t tell a single Filipino story by heart to my own child. These wonderful stories from the Philippines deserve to be cherished and embedded in young imaginations, and this book was a way for us to do that. Simply choosing to tell Indigenous Filipino stories at bedtime can spark curiosity, conversations, and pride. This keeps the connection to our culture vibrant and alive.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.onceuponthesunandsea.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Once Upon the Sun &amp; Sea is available for purchase<\/a> on Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Book Baby, and other online retailers worldwide.
