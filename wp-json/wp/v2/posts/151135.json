Payne is an award-winning ghostwriter of over forty books. In his spare time, he has always found himself drawn to &#8220;the big questions&#8221; of life, and philosophy is his major avocation. &#8220;So Who is God, Anyway?: an UNorthodox Theory for Doubters, Skeptics, and Recovering Fundamentalists,&#8221; is the culmination of more than 30 years of philosophical research into the questions of God&#8217;s existence and God\u2019s nature. Payne lives on the Gulf Coast of Florida and when he&#8217;s not writing or mulling the big questions, he can be found on his sailboat, Pilar, named after Ernest Hemingway&#8217;s fishing boat. He also enjoys the cinema and traveling, and when engaged in the latter, he seeks out historic hotels (preferably haunted ones) and good Irish pubs. Of all the things he&#8217;s most proud of, being a father and grandfather top the list.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Kayla Zadel<br \/>InDistribution Media<br \/>+1 561-544-0719<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/contact_author\/710492010\" data-src=\"akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">email us here<\/a><br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/authorgspayne\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=hExYdWt1__FDeKbX&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      May 13, 2024, 13:15 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/710492010\/new-book-release-so-who-is-god-anyway-by-g-s-payne\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
