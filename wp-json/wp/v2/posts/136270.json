The segment accounted for the highest market share in 2021, contributing to about three-fifths of the global K12 education market revenue. This is mainly because the innovations brought in the K-12 model are universally accepted across the global education system and compulsory for private schools. In grades K-12, teachers encourage students by conducting many questions-and-answer sessions and various other activities to help students build advanced learning habits. On the contrary, the public segment would manifest the highest CAGR of 18.5% over the analysis timeframe. K12 online public schools attempt to offer a personalized and high-quality education with detailed instructions from state-certified teachers to help the students achieve their optimum levels.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The on-premise segment to hold the biggest market share in terms of revenue by 2031 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Based on deployment mode, the on-premise segment generated the highest market share in 2021, contributing to nearly three-fifths of the global K12 education market revenue, and is predicted to continue steady growth during the forecast period. This is mainly because it is easily possible to provide a high level of security with an on-premises solution for schools. However, the cloud segment is predicted to rise at a stunning CAGR of 18.4% over the analysis period. The valuable and affordable features of cloud computing are available to K-12 school districts. These features offer numerous benefits to schools such as the eradication of the need for expensive hardware, improved access and mobility, and lower data storage costs.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>The hardware segment registered the major share in 2021\u00a0 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">By spend analysis, the hardware segment generated the highest market share in terms of revenue, providing nearly half of the global K12 education market in 2021. E-learning and software solutions offer integrated corporate resource planning tools that can pave the way for the generation of better courses and more constructive delivery of classes. On the contrary, the software segment is predicted to hold the lion\u2019s share and manifest the highest CAGR of 19.4% over the estimated timeframe. This is mainly because software solutions offer institutions with planned organization resource planning systems that can support faculty members in creating better courses and fruitfully managing classrooms and schools.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>North America region to manifest a significant revenue growth in 2031 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Based on region, North America generated the largest market share in 2021, delivering more than two-fifths of the global K12 education market revenue, and is predicted to continue promising growth over the estimated period. This growth is mainly due to the increasing emphasis on minimizing the administrative load on teachers, huge spending on EdTech, the growing need for personalized learning in classrooms, and the surging demand for advanced solutions to foster students\u2019 school achievement. On the contrary, the market in the Asia-Pacific region is predicted to grow at the fastest CAGR of 19.2% over the analysis timeframe. This is mainly due to the extensive adoption of online learning by millions of students across the region. Many nations in the region have created their entire K-12 curriculum over online platforms.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Enquiry Before Buying:<\/strong> <strong><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/Tracker?data=z91goM_dUC7zdM6XtvBxfENAVuplqu3XzySKIYHPd025JbEsdOFnykuDwJ7l95h-eJA3mMT2_OSrF4QWihvputGJ9VtYYFtQdI2DMnEeV9NkGD0BmxQSkBOKwbbHgYX9zS7wa8HUaFCeTo4pPtpMx1EbbyRCYvOXmpPaqlkwfm7f85FC4XwJE124vz91ld83\" data-wpel-link=\"external\"><u>https:\/\/www.alliedmarketresearch.com\/purchase-enquiry\/47850<\/u><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>Prominent market players: <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pearson media company<\/li>\n<li>Adobe Systems Inc.<\/li>\n<li>D2L corporation<\/li>\n<li>Samsung Electronics Co Ltd<\/li>\n<li>International Business Machines Corporation<\/li>\n<li>Oracle Corporation<\/li>\n<li>Smart technologies<\/li>\n<li>Cengage Group<\/li>\n<li>Microsoft Corporation<\/li>\n<li>BLACKBOARD MEDIA PRIVATE LIMITED<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p align=\"justify\"><strong>About Us:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Allied Market Research (AMR) is a full-service market research and business-consulting wing of Allied Analytics LLP based in Wilmington, Delaware.
