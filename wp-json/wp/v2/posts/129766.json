With The House That Ruth Built, award-winning author Kelly Bennett recreates the excitement of that opening day game\u2014the stadium, the fans, the food, the pigeons\u2026Watch out!, players taking the field, the Umpire\u2019s \u201cPlay ball!\u201d\u2014and the big question. Could the Babe come through? Prior to the game, legendary slugger Babe Ruth\u2014the Great Bambino, King of Swing, the Big Bam\u2014said, \u201cI&#8217;d give a year of my life if I could hit a home run on opening day of this great new park.\u201d Could the Babe come through? <\/p>\n<p>Vivid, vibrant true-to-event illustrations reminiscent of Norman Rockwell, created by Susanna Covelli, go hand-in-hand with the lyrical text to recreate the sights and feel of that first baseball game that very first fateful game that christened The House That Ruth Built. Bennett collaborated with several baseball organizations to get the details of this book just right. Historical facts included are diverse, inclusive, and accurate. <\/p>\n<p>Bennett dedicated the book to her grandfather, Joe Silva, a semi-pro catcher, who played baseball with Babe Ruth on Barnstorming trips to California. \u201cWe\u2019re a baseball family,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI used to keep stats for my kids\u2019 baseball and softball teams. I think it\u2019s really, for me, an underrated sport to a lot of people. With baseball you never know what\u2019s going to happen. In basketball, you know everyone is going for the basket. In football, you know they\u2019re going for the end zone. In baseball, you have no idea where the ball is going, yet everyone\u2019s brains is going 100 miles per hour.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Over 85 seasons, Yankee Stadium hosted 6,581 NY Yankees regular season games, 161 postseason games\u2014more than any other stadium in baseball history\u2014and 33 World Series. The Yanks weren\u2019t the only Big-League team to call Yankee Stadium \u201chome\u201d either. On July 5, 1930, the Stadium hosted its first baseball game between Negro League teams and over the next 18 years, until 1948, served as home field for teams fielding future Hall of Famers such as Satchel Paige, \u201cPop\u201d Lloyd, Cool Papa Bell, Josh Gibson, and Jackie Robinson.<\/p>\n<p>Baseball Aficionados of all ages \u2014Yankees fans or not\u2014will linger over the sidebars of baseball history, trivia, and vintage photographs.
