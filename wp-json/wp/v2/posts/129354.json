The property has experienced several transformational milestones, each contributing to its stature as a premier golf destination.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In 1926, the Waynesville Country Club was established based on a sketch from the legendary architect <span class=\"xn-person\">Donald Ross<\/span>. A community-supported expansion in 1929 allowed the club to grow further, adding to its legacy. The addition of the charming Woodcrest building in 1939 was a significant step in accommodating the increasing demand for extended stays.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The transformative vision of W.T. <span class=\"xn-person\">Eller and George Kimball<\/span>, who purchased the club in 1946, led to further improvements that enhanced the club&#8217;s appeal. Fast-forward to the 2000s, and a series of upgrades took place, including revamping the Golfview building and constructing a new Brookside building. In 2006, the property was purchased by <span class=\"xn-person\">David Stubbs<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-person\">Sammy Carver<\/span>, leading to its transformation into Waynesville Inn &#8211; Golf Resort and Spa in 2009. \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Raines&#8217;s acquisition of the property in <span class=\"xn-chron\">April 2021<\/span> marked the beginning of a new chapter, where historical charm met modern comforts. \u00a0Following two years of meticulous renovation and rebranding under the direction of\u00a0<b><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/c212.net\/c\/link\/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3941181-1&amp;h=1585843757&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rainesco.com%2Fwoven-by-raines%2F&amp;a=Woven+by+Raines\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Woven by Raines<\/a><\/b>, a specialized company division providing a unique development and management approach to boutique hotels, Waynesville Inn &amp; Golf Club now stands as a testament to its enduring allure and celebrated legacy.<\/p>\n<p><b>Charting the Path Forward: The Property&#8217;s Future Vision <br class=\"dnr\"><\/b><span>The historic 165-acre property of the <\/span><span class=\"xn-location\">Waynesville<\/span><span> Inn &amp; Golf Club now boasts 72 newly refurbished guest rooms, a comprehensive 18-hole golf course and practice facilities,\u00a0a vast 6,000 square feet of flexible event space, an inviting Event Lawn, and a variety of dining options that seamlessly adapt to any event or occasion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Guests at Waynesville Inn &amp; Golf Club can choose from various accommodation options; each imbued with a distinct charm. The historic Inn offers nostalgia-infused rooms in the building dating back to 1926, while the Brookside rooms resonate with a classic &#8217;60s roadside motel vibe.
