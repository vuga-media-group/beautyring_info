The only advantage is the added minerals but this does not have any proven health benefits. Most of the bottled water has a pH level below 7.2 which means it is slightly acidic in nature.<\/p>\n<p>RO Water \u2013 The water processed through Reverse Osmosis loses all types of minerals both good as well as bad.  The water pH falls below 7.2 and it becomes more acidic than bottled water. <\/p>\n<p>Tap Water \u2013 The water supplied by local municipal authority is neutral in most of the cases, however, tap water sometimes becomes contaminated with germs and chemicals while water is traveling through the distribution system. The pH is likely to drop further due to contamination, which results in the same acidity problem.<\/p>\n<p>Consuming acidic water (pH below 7.2) on a regular basis leads to acidity which is one of the root causes of major known health diseases.<\/p>\n<p>Would you knowingly drink acidic water?<br \/>No one would knowingly continue to drink acidic water that can damage your DNA, lead to many diseases and put your precious life in danger.  So what is the solution?  Well, it\u2019s time you looked into an upgrade of your drinking water. Give yourself and all your near and dear ones the gift of healthy water and say goodbye to that unhealthy, acidic, toxic water lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>Properties of Healthy Water<br \/>Healthy water improves your body\u2019s immune system and helps it fight any health disorder from the common cold to that old nemesis \u2018cancer\u2019. The key properties of healthy water are:<br \/>1.\tMildly Alkaline (preferable pH range \u2013 pH 8.0 to pH 9.0)<br \/>2.\tAnti-oxidant loaded (Water with negative ORP)<br \/>3.\tMicro-clustered (Reduced Size Water)<br \/>4.\tRich in dissolved hydrogen<br \/>5.\tRich in Alkaline Minerals Calcium, Potassium, Magnesium &amp; Sodium<\/p>\n<p>Introduction to <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/scienceofwellness.in\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Alkaline Water<\/a> Ionizer<br \/>In recent years, the popularity of alkaline water ionizers has surged, with proponents claiming a myriad of health benefits. A water ionizer is a home appliance that are designed to alter the pH level of the water by using electrolysis process, typically from neutral pH (7.2) to alkaline levels pH(8-9.5). This process involves passing water through the electrolysis chamber that uses negative (cathode) electrodes and positive (anode) electrodes. In the electrolysis chamber, the electrical power separates the water into alkaline water near the negative electrodes and acidic water near the positive electrodes. Near the negative electrodes, the positively ionized minerals, such as calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K) and sodium (Na) and dissolved hydrogen produce the high pH alkaline water, whereas near the positive electrodes, negatively ionized minerals, such as chlorine (Cl), sulfur (S) and dissolved oxygen make the low pH acidic water.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the branded products use electrodes made of anti-rust metal Titanium coated with Platinum.<\/p>\n<p>Why is Alkaline <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/scienceofwellness.in\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Ionized water<\/a> considered to be \u201cSuper Healthy\u201d water?<br \/>As a result of an electrolysis process, the Ionizers produce Alkaline Ionized Water which contains several <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/scienceofwellness.in\/alkaline-water-ionizer-healthy-water\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">health properties<\/a> such as \u2013<\/p>\n<p>1.\tThe ionized water is anti-oxidant which helps in neutralizing the free radicals.  These are harmful molecules that can damage cells and contribute to aging, heart disease, arthritis and a whole host of diseases.<br \/>2.\tThe ionized water is micro-clustered i.e. the size of the water gets reduced to almost 2\/3rd size of the normal water that results in superior and more hydration as compare to the normal water. This is excellent for quick hydration after yoga, a workout, for athletes, and for anyone recovering from any health issue. <br \/>3.\tThe ionized water is Alkaline \u2013 The Ionizer offers different alkaline levels from mild to strong alkaline ranging pH 8.0 to pH 9.5. The alkalinity of the water helps alleviating the symptoms of acid reflux and neutralizing the excess acidity in the body, which is often associated with poor diet, stress and pollution and the root cause of many of the known diseases. <br \/>4.\tThe ionized water is rich in dissolved hydrogen \u2013 The water produced by the ionizer contains thousands of tiny bubbles. These bubbles are molecular hydrogen that is dissolved in the water. Consuming dissolved hydrogen water helps eliminate free radicals. <br \/>5.\tThe ionized water is rich in alkaline minerals \u2013 as a result of electrolysis process, the alkaline minerals such as Calcium (Ca), Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg) &amp; Sodium (Na) become a part of the drinking water and all harmful minerals, heavy metals drain out as part of the waste water. This results in more concentration of healthy minerals that are most required for human body metabolism.<\/p>\n<p>Aura Science Of Wellness LLP<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/scienceofwellness.in\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">https:\/\/scienceofwellness.in<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Aura Science of Wellness is a Pune, India based company that\u2019s leading innovation in the distribution and retail of premium health and wellness products by offering the finest \u2018end to end\u2019 eco-friendly, medical grade premium certified products that promote health and wellness.<\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s products have wide acceptance and are endorsed by health conscious families, individuals, corporate companies with a focus on their employee well-being, yoga centers, doctors, sports professionals, and a few celebrities.<\/p>\n<p class=\"contact\" dir=\"auto\" style=\"margin: 1em 0;\">Swapnil Gaur<br \/>Aura Science Of Wellness LLP<br \/>+91 77220 97009<br \/>sales@scienceofwellness.in<br \/>Visit us on social media:<br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AuraScienceOfWellness\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Facebook<\/a><br \/><a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/aurascienceofwellness\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>    <img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"\" class=\"prtr\" src=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/tracking\/article.gif?t=2&amp;a=a5VvtYainoR9FGk5&amp;i=akWTtSZOi21hyjZX\"\/><\/p>\n<div class=\"article-footer\">\n<p class=\"text-center\">You just read:<\/p>\n<div class=\"share-vertical-bottom\">\n<div class=\"fleft pull-left\">\n<p>News Provided By<\/p>\n<p>\n      February 23, 2024, 15:01 GMT\n    <\/p>\n<\/p><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>      <input readonly=\"readonly\" type=\"text\" value=\"https:\/\/www.einpresswire.com\/article\/690805954\/aura-science-of-wellness-introduces-the-alkaline-water-ionizer-machines\"\/><\/p>\n<p>\n        <br \/>EIN Presswire&#8217;s priority is source transparency.
