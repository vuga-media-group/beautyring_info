Sleep tourism fosters an appreciation for the importance of relaxation and rejuvenation, acknowledging the crucial role that sleep plays in sustaining a healthy lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At Emma, we believe that a great night&#8217;s sleep should be accessible to everyone&#8221; said Dr. Dennis Schmoltzi, Co-Founder and CEO of Emma \u2013 The Sleep Company. &#8220;We&#8217;re immensely proud to be the first sleep brand to open its own dedicated sleep hotels in <span class=\"xn-location\">Australia<\/span> and <span class=\"xn-location\">Taiwan<\/span>.
