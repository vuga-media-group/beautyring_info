Every time a reader buys a copy of The Bitter End, one pound of plastic is removed from the environment before it can reach the ocean. The author is committed to cleaning up 1,000 pounds of plastic from the sea in 2023 and will increase the donation as sales increase. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have so many special memories of summers on Cape Cod and Mattapoisett, Massachusetts and the seacoast has always been a special place to me. I know many of my readers love the ocean as I do, and I was shocked to learn that more than 11 million tons of plastic enter our oceans each year. Regardless of how many books I sell, together with my readers, I know my novel is doing something good for our planet and helping to keep our oceans clean,\u201d explains Elise Lapham. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cPlastic pollution has significantly impacted our oceans and affected countless marine life. Our global network of collection hubs ensures the responsible handling of plastic waste in affected areas. We are happy to partner with author Elise Lapham to help our cause and would like to say thank you to her readers for their support,\u201d says Joel Tasche, Co-CEO and Founder of CleanHub.<\/p>\n<p>Set during the summer of 1990 in a New England coastal town, The Bitter End is a historical fiction romance novel. Protagonist Lilly Conroy decides to take her son John to spend the summer at her family&#8217;s beach house in the town of Mattapoisett, Massachusetts near Cape Cod. Here she hopes to muster the strength to reinvent herself and focus on building a new life away from a marriage that was filled with heartache and disappointment.<\/p>\n<p>The story flashes back to Lilly\u2019s younger years during the Vietnam war era, which leads to a big surprise for readers (and Lilly!) when she returns to her childhood summer home. As the summer unfolds, old flames are reunited, but what was found may be lost again. A big secret looms that could tear two people apart.<\/p>\n<p>The Bitter End is available now at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.barnesandnoble.com\/w\/the-bitter-end-elise-lapham\/1143786518;jsessionid=657D7EDD95ACD0A0FB92EEB96E47BA97.prodny_store01-atgap06?ean=9781662941108\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Barnes &amp; Noble<\/a>, Amazon, and Walmart.
