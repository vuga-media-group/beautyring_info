He then completed his internal medicine training at The Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York and his hematology and medical oncology fellowships at the State University of New York. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing in the field for over a decade. I am fortunate to have been able to see, through the last several years, concepts and ideas that we thought would make sense, being tested out in the bench with a basic science research, and over the years, transcend and come to fruition, in terms of what we\u2019re able to deliver and results and outcomes we\u2019re able to get for our patients,\u201d said Efiom-Ekaha.<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maen Hussein, M.D. <\/strong>Hussein is a medical oncologist and hematologist at Florida Cancer Specialists &amp; Research Institute (FCS) and has recently been elected to serve as president in 2024 for the Florida Society of Clinical Oncology (FLASCO) board of directors.

Hussein also serves on the Finance Committee of the FCS executive board and on the FCS Foundation board of directors, of which he is the immediate past chair. \u201cOncologists strive to get patients to remission, maintain quality of life, prolong survival, and I wanted to be part of this.
