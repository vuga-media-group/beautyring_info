Largely based on a meticulous Burroughs-esque cut-and-paste method, this curated collection of works from 2013-2017 is made of poems, vignettes, thoughts, and microstories.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMicrocosms is a throwback in the spirit of youth&#8217;s indelible experience,\u201d andrw says. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt came to me leading up to my seventh year of sobriety, living openly as a queer person with a supportive and compassionate partner, that things have never been quite this good. And I revel in it\u2014I truly do. There are at least as many pieces of me as days that I\u2019ve lived existing across a linear narrative made of very real photos and film snippets and dialogues and audio, all playing at the same time in my mind; books, clothes, untouchable objects, drawings, tattoos, scars, songs, and old writing, among others.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>Their new book, microcosms: poems, vignettes, thoughts &amp; microstories from 2013-2017, is available now in paperback.<\/p>\n<p>Who should read this book? <\/p>\n<p>Soaked in the spillings of shotgunned beers, dusted in amphetamine and pill crumbs, drained of dopamine, starved for affection, perpetually ineffectual, ill-humored, and violently cynical, this book quietly brawls with the coming of age of a late-blooming, vexed, and frightened creature. This book is for folks looking for an experimental experience, from a person wrestling with the squirming feeling of having read too much Bukowski and Kerouac in the name of romanticizing the abuse of drugs and of people in an effort to make the narrative of a \u201cman\u201d fit into a body and mind ill-fit for it. For those who can see that putting yourself on blast can be a way to reason with your suffering and need for recompense.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll of this writing has been hanging over me,\u201d andrw adds, \u201cyearning to be otherwise burned or seen. The need to pretend to be hypersexual, or sexual at all, to be a man in the eyes of others hurt me in ways that I\u2019m still confronting in therapy. Putting this book out into the world now, after so many years, is a testament to however close I can get to the idea of closure. It is otherwise a redemption of my own self: amnesty for the wounded animal of my young soul.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Primary Process Archive, andrw\u2019s own sound art label and book imprint, published this book. <\/p>\n<p>andrw\u2019s book is dedicated as follows: \u201cFor the pieces of me held in rooms I\u2019ll never see again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s next for andrw fx? <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nandrw is currently working on two novellas and a musical slated for release in 2024. <\/p>\n<p>Questions and Interviews<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nandrw fx is available for interviews to discuss their new book, as well as speaking engagements, and bookstore events. <\/p>\n<p>Contact<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nTo get in touch, email andrw@andrwfx.com<\/p>\n<p>Author and Book Photos<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nDownload high-resolution <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/9dc81eab-e84e-4150-955e-d367016fd851.usrfiles.com\/archives\/9dc81e_95dad1dee3164793b3e8f91305381fb9.zip\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">author photos here<\/a> and <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/9dc81eab-e84e-4150-955e-d367016fd851.usrfiles.com\/archives\/9dc81e_9fafe045fbd84b148bcd69a77f6f699b.zip\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">book photos here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>About andrw fx<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\nandrw fx is a contemporary artist who works in fiction, sound, illustration, assemblage, painting, and other media.
