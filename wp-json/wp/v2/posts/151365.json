When his marriage ended suddenly, his perfect life and sense of self were shattered.<\/p>\n<p>His legal battles threatened everything he had, and he soon found himself working non-stop, leading to a downward spiral filled with anxious days and sleepless nights. Dunn&#8217;s riches-to-rags journey took him from LA to a mid-divorce crash-landing in Berlin. He found himself wondering &#8220;what the hell&#8221; he had done by choosing to divorce his husband and throwing it all away.<\/p>\n<p>Feeling like a failure, especially to the LGBTQ+ community, he sought guidance in books to navigate the complexities of gay divorce, only to find an absence of relevant literature. As he puts it, &#8220;gay divorce was a desert. And I was a broken unicorn walking blindly through it.&#8221; Frustrated by the lack of resources, he decided to use his divorce as his crisis of identity. He chronicled the experience in his book, &#8220;<a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/How-Burn-Rainbow-Marriage-Divorce\/dp\/B0CZLZX89Q\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">How To Burn A Rainbow<\/a>,&#8221; to be published on May 17, 2024, the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia. This raw and unflinching memoir, which has been called \u201cthe Gay Eat, Pray, Love,&#8221; welcomes readers into the heart of Dunn&#8217;s transformative journey\u2014burning the scripts written for him by both the gay and straight worlds, facing down his deepest fears, and forging his own path to self-love. <\/p>\n<p>Navigating the legal labyrinth of divorce, Dunn sheds light on the inadequacies of existing laws, particularly in their failure to address queer experiences. He explains in his book, &#8220;Like everyone encountering divorce for the first time, I went through a massive learning curve on the law. Plus, I discovered a ton of practical stuff about how to handle yourself while going through a divorce\u2014all things I wished I\u2019d known at the start. I made a ton of expensive mistakes, embarrassed myself at work and with friends, and tried to choke answers out of completely the wrong people and places&#8230;Now, having been through a divorce, I believe there are a lot of questions LGBTQ+ folks should be asking about the whole institution: why we raced to get married, what we expected it to be, and why it\u2019s such legal torture for anyone to get out of it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Dunn&#8217;s story seamlessly weaves together personal narrative, self-help insights, travel anecdotes, spiritual reflections, practical wisdom, and incisive analysis of marriage and divorce, making it accessible to a diverse audience.
