But there are a lot of common questions and misconceptions around PrEP: Is it for everyone? Is PrEP safe? And how effective is it? Dr. Kamila Seilhan, Board-Certified Internist and Medical Director of <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.labfinder.com\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">LabFinder.com<\/a>, an online scheduling platform for patient laboratory and radiology appointments, answers the top 10 questions about PrEP. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow external noreferrer sponsored\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.labfinder.com\/blood-test\/hiv-i-and-ii\/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">HIV testing<\/a> is available from LabFinder. <\/p>\n<p>1. Is PrEP effective at preventing HIV?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cThe short answer is definitively yes. When taken as prescribed, PrEP reduces the risk of contracting HIV through sex by 99%. There\u2019s less information about people who are at risk of contracting HIV through needle sharing, but for this group PrEP appears to be at least 74% effective, which is still very significant,\u201d said Dr. Seilhan.<\/p>\n<p>2. If someone thinks they\u2019ve just been exposed to HIV, should they start PrEP?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cThis is a common misconception about PrEP,\u201d Dr. Seilhan explained. \u201cPrEP is a preventative measure that needs to be taken regularly and before exposure in order to be effective. It\u2019s not for occasional or one-time use,\u201d she added.<\/p>\n<p>3. Is PrEP safe to use?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cAgain, the answer here is unequivocally yes. Studies have found no significant negative effects in people who have maintained a PrEP regimen for five years. Of course, like any medication, there\u2019s always a potential for some side effects, but they\u2019re generally mild for most people\u201d Dr. Seilhan said.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the side effects someone might have from PrEP include:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tNausea<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tDiarrhea<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tHeadache<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tFatigue<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tStomach pain<\/p>\n<p>4. Who is a good candidate for PrEP?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cPrEP is for people with an elevated risk for contracting HIV. Those who aren\u2019t regularly engaging in higher-risk activities don\u2019t need to take PrEP. That being said, only about 10% of the worldwide population who would benefit from PrEP are currently taking these drugs according to the WHO,\u201d said Dr. Seilhan.<\/p>\n<p>Someone should consider PrEP if they\u2019re HIV-negative and meet any of the following criteria:<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\thas a sexual partner who has HIV<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\thas sex without consistently using condoms <br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tdiagnosed with an STD in the last 6 months<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\tshares needles or drug injection materials<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u2022\thas an injection partner who has HIV<\/p>\n<p>5. Does PrEP prevent all STIs?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cThis is another common misconception, and it\u2019s important for people to know that the answer is no. PrEP only helps to prevent HIV. Other STIs\u2014like syphilis and gonorrhea\u2014are not prevented by PrEP, and people who take PrEP medications should still use condoms to protect themselves from these other infections,\u201d said Dr. Seilhan.<\/p>\n<p>6. What PrEP medications are approved by the FDA?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cThere are a few different options here. Some will work better for different people depending on individual preferences as well as limitations of the medications themselves, but there are options for everyone,\u201d said Dr. Seilhan.<\/p>\n<p>Truvada is a medication that is effective for everyone. It contains tenofovir disoproxil plus either emtricitabine or lamivudine, and there are generic versions available.<\/p>\n<p>Descovy is another medication that contains tenofovir disoproxil and emtricitabine as well as alafenamide. This medication is effective for men and for transgender women. For people assigned female at birth who are at risk of contracting HIV through receptive vaginal sex, Descovy should not be used. There is no generic version at this time.<\/p>\n<p>Vocabria is a drug that contains cabotegravir. This is a drug used to treat HIV but can also be used for PrEP on a short-term basis. There is no generic version at this time.<\/p>\n<p>Apretude is the final PrEP drug currently approved for use in the United States. It also contains cabotegravir but is for long-term use. There is no generic version at this time.<\/p>\n<p>7. How are PrEP medications taken?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cApretude is an injection that you get at your healthcare provider\u2019s office, and it\u2019s effective for two months. The other medications are all daily oral tablets. It\u2019s important to remember to take these at the same time every day, not only after a potential HIV exposure,\u201d Dr. Seilhan said.<\/p>\n<p>8. What about the PrEP ring?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cDapivirine is a microbicidal vaginal ring that\u2019s used for PrEP in some African countries, but it has not been approved by the FDA. While some studies have found it to be effective and without serious side effects, it\u2019s not currently being considered by the FDA and isn\u2019t likely to be available in the US anytime soon,\u201d Dr. Seilhan said.<\/p>\n<p>9. What if a dose is missed?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cIf one of the pills gets missed, the best thing to do is take it as soon as you realize it and then get back onto the normal schedule. If it\u2019s getting close to the next time to take it when you remember, just take one at the normal time\u2014don\u2019t double up. If someone is going to miss an injection, they should talk to their healthcare provider to come up with a plan,\u201d Dr. Seilhan advised.<\/p>\n<p>10. Is PrEP covered by insurance?<br \/>&#13;<br \/>\n\u201cUnder the Affordable Care Act, PrEP is required to be covered by nearly all insurance plans. For people without insurance, there are several assistance programs available, and there are details on the CDC\u2019s website,\u201d said Dr. Seilhan.<\/p>\n<p>Bio: Kamila Seilhan DO is a New York City-based internal medicine specialist who has been in practice for more than 20 years.
